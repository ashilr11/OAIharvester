<dc:description>Consider a spectrally negative Lévy process with unknown diffusion coefficient and Lévy measure and suppose that the high frequency trading data is given. We use the techniques of threshold estimation and regularized Laplace inversion to obtain the estimator of survival probability for a spectrally negative Lévy process. The asymptotic properties are given for the proposed estimator. Simulation studies are also given to show the finite sample performance of our estimator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Convolutional sparse coding (CSC) models are becoming increasingly popular in the signal and image processing communities in recent years. Several research studies have addressed the basis pursuit (BP) problem of the CSC model, including the recently proposed local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm. This algorithm adopts slice-based local processing ideas and splits the global sparse vector into local vector needles that are locally computed in the original domain to obtain the encoding. However, a convergence theorem for the LoBCoD algorithm has not been given previously. This paper presents a convergence theorem for the LoBCoD algorithm which proves that the LoBCoD algorithm will converge to its global optimum at a rate of O1/k. A slice-based multilayer local block coordinate descent (ML-LoBCoD) algorithm is proposed which is motivated by the multilayer basis pursuit (ML-BP) problem and the LoBCoD algorithm. We prove that the ML-LoBCoD algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution at a rate O1/k. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the better performance of the proposed ML-LoBCoD algorithm compared to the LoBCoD algorithm for the BP problem, and the loss function value is also lower for ML-LoBCoD than LoBCoD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inkjet printing presents a high potential for cost reduction of electronic devices manufacturing due to the capacity to deposit materials with high precision, less material waste, and large-scale production through the roll-to-roll printing processes. In this work, a nanostructured TiO2 ink was developed using TiO2 aerogel and an alkaline aqueous solution, which resulted in a very stable suspension. A high-intensity ultrasonic mixer was used to fragment and disperse TiO2 aerogels producing suspensions with particles smaller than 200 nm, which are suitable for the inkjet printing process. For the development of the ink, the viscosity and surface tension were adjusted by using glycerol and a surfactant (Triton X-100). The influence of those components on the properties of the ink was evaluated for different concentrations. After formulation of the inks, the printing parameters were adjusted to optimize the process. Films with high surface area and less than 100 nm grain size were successfully produced. Electrical measurements revealed a resistive-like behavior with the sheet resistance increasing with number of printed layers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the respective correlation between the height (H) of a posterior malleolar fracture (PMF) and the involved area (S) of an articular surface and the presence of “die-punch.” Methods. Patients with closed posterior malleolar fractures admitted to our hospital from January 2015 to December 2017 were selected, with complete X-ray and 3D reconstruction CT imaging data. The gender, age, injured side, and surgical fixation methods of the patients were recorded. A preoperative ankle CT scan was performed, and the images were viewed through the PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems). Simultaneously, the involved joint surface area (S) by the posterior malleolar fracture was measured, as well as the proportion of the fracture area to the total ankle joint area. On the sagittal reconstruction CT images, the height (H) of the posterior malleolar fracture was measured to compare the correlation between the height of the fracture and the area of the fracture, as well as the area ratio. Besides, according to the presence or absence of “die-punch,” patients were divided into two groups: A and B. And each group was further divided into three subgroups according to age (16-39 years old, 40-59 years old, and ≥60 years old). The statistical differences in the height of fracture between the subgroups were compared. Results. A total of 48 patients, aged 16-82 years, with an average age of 48.9 years, were included in this study, including 13 males and 35 females. There were 20 cases of left ankle injury and 28 cases of right ankle injury. The average height of the posterior malleolar fractures was 18.19 mm, the average area of the fracture was 202.28 mm2, and the average ratio of the fracture area to the total articular surface area was 17.84%. Besides, die-punch was seen in 27 cases and not in 21 cases. The average height of fractures was 21.33±5.38 mm in group A1, 14.38±9.01 mm in group B1, 18.30±7.95 mm in group A2, 14.48±5.37 mm in group B2, 26.26±6.73 mm in group A3, and 12.77±3.07 mm in group B3. Conclusion. The height (H) of the posterior malleolar fractures is positively correlated with the fracture area (S) and the fracture area ratio (FAR). The posterior malleolar fractures with “die-punch” tend to have a greater average height than that without “die-punch.” In clinical work, orthopedic surgeons should not only pay attention to the size of the posterior malleolus fracture but also value its height, which hopefully could provide insight into the treatment and prognosis of PMF patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. MicroRNAs play vital roles in the development of endometriosis. It is reported that miR-200b-3p is downregulated in endometriosis, although its mechanisms in this disease remain still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the function and potential regulatory network of miR-200b-3p in endometriosis through database analysis. Methods. The endometriosis gene expression profiles were downloaded from the GEO database to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The predicted and validated target genes of miR-200b-3p were obtained from miRWalk and miRTarBase database. Then, a comparison was performed between miR-200b-3p target genes and DEGs. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the target genes was performed using clusterProfiler package. STRING was used to predict the protein-protein interaction among the proteins encoded by the target genes. Then, TransmiR, LncBase, StarBase, PROMO, and AnimalTFDB were employed to identify interactive transcription factors and lncRNAs of miR-200b-3p. Results. miR-200b-3p was associated with the transcription factors DNMT1, EZH2, HNF1B, JUN, MYB, ZEB1, and ZEB2 during the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The downstream 110 target genes were involved in the biological processes of positive regulation of MAPK cascade, muscle cell proliferation, organ growth, vasculogenesis, and axon development. KEGG analysis revealed that the main pathways related to miR-200b-3p were microRNAs in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, colorectal cancer, and tight junction. In addition, four lncRNAs such as MALAT1, NEAT1, SNHG22, and XIST interacted with miR-200b-3p and were associated with transcription factors FOXP3 and YY1. Conclusion. The predicted target genes and molecular regulatory network of miR-200b-3p in endometriosis not only revealed its biological function but also provided a valuable guideline for further research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Neighborhood destinations play important roles in daily activity levels of older adults. However, little is known about how specific destinations are associated with these activities and/or sedentary behaviors, especially in Asia. This study investigated how neighborhood destinations were associated with physical activity recommendations and excessive sedentary time among older adults. Methods. A telephone-based survey was conducted to collect cross-sectional data on the sociodemographic variables, residential neighborhoods, physical activities, and sedentary behaviors of 1,040 adults aged 65 years and above. Using data derived from Geographic Information Systems (GIS), an adjusted logistic regression was performed to examine the relationships between five neighborhood destination types (i.e., recreational facilities, utilitarian destinations, transit stops, temples, and schools) and both overall physical activity level and sedentary behavior. Results. Significant interactions related to physical activity and sedentary behavior were observed based on both gender and neighborhood destinations. After adjusting for potential confounders, older men living in neighborhoods containing higher numbers of temples were more likely to achieve physical activity recommendations (OR=1.85; 95% CI: 1.16–2.96). On the other hand, older women living in neighborhoods containing higher numbers of utilitarian destinations were more likely to engage in excessive sedentary time (OR=1.70; 95% CI: 1.12–2.56). Conclusions. In Asia, the presence of favorable local neighborhood temples may support physical activity levels for older men, while utilitarian destinations (which have previously been found to support activeness) may be related to excessive sedentary behaviors in older women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. Although laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is a frequently performed bariatric procedure, there is still no consensus on its technical implementation. Methods. 211 patients treated with LRYGB in a single institution between March 2011 and October 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. A subgroup analysis for the linear (LSA) versus circular stapler technique (CSA) for gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) was performed to evaluate complications and outcomes. Results. 128 (60.6%) patients received GJA with CSA and 83 (39.4%) with LSA. Average weight loss one year after surgery, respectively, BMI after one year of follow-up (kg/m2), showed no significant difference. Median surgery time was significantly shorter in the LSA group. If the procedure was performed with CSA, significantly more wound infections occurred. Conclusions. Both the circular and the linear stapler techniques for gastrojejunal anastomosis in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are safe methods with comparable outcomes. A disadvantage of CSA is the significantly higher rate of wound infections, a circumstance which requires increased attention.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial antioxidant, has protective effects on liver-related diseases. However, the role of MitoTEMPO on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its possible mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of MitoTEMPO on NAFLD using high fat diet- (HFD-) induced obese mice as animal models. MitoTEMPO was intraperitoneally injected into HFD mice. Liver morphological changes were observed by H&amp;E and Oil Red O staining, and the frequency of MDSCs in peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, real-time quantitative PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to detect the mRNA and protein expressions in the liver tissues. The results showed that the hepatic steatosis in liver tissues of HFD mice injected with MitoTEMPO was significantly ameliorated. Additionally, MitoTEMPO reduced the frequency of CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs in peripheral circulation and decreased Gr-1+ cell accumulation in the livers. Further studies demonstrated that MitoTEMPO administration suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of MDSC-associated proinflammatory mediators, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9). Our results suggest that MitoTEMPO appears to be a potential chemical compound affecting certain immune cells and further ameliorates inflammation in obese-associated NAFLD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cumulative plastic strain (CPS) damage index is proposed in this study for seismic fragility analysis by integrating the force analogy method into the energy balance equation, and CPS can be defined as the ratio of the demand of plastic dissipation energy to its capacity. The cumulative plastic strain can indicate the structural damage cumulative effect under earthquakes, which makes it especially suitable to be selected as the damage index for the structural component. Threshold values of cumulative plastic strain for different performance limit state (PLS) levels are obtained through the degree of consistency of interstory drift-based fragility curves and CPS-based fragility curves. Regarding the multidimensional fragility evaluation, CPS and the floor acceleration will be selected as the quantification indices for performance limit state of the structural component and nonstructural component, respectively. The probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM) following multivariate logarithmic normal distribution will be developed, and taking PLS uncertainty and correlation into consideration, multidimensional PLS function is constructed to identify the structural failure domain. A full-scale 2-bay 2-story frame structure for the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) project is employed as the case study structure to demonstrate the proposed theory. Nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis is carried out for the structure to obtain its maximum responses under earthquakes. Consequently, the multidimensional fragility curves can be derived on the basis of CPS. Besides, the influence of PLS threshold value, engineering demand parameter (EDP) correlation, and PLS correlation on the multidimensional fragility is investigated. Results show that (1) CPS damage index can fully consider the cumulative effect of damage under earthquakes, which makes up for the deficiency of the interstory drift damage index in this aspect, (2) the multidimensional fragility framework can deal with the PLS correlation and EDP correlation simultaneously, which will generate a more precise seismic damage assessment result, and (3) multidimensional fragility is sensitive to PLS threshold values and PLS correlation parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Three-dimensional modelling of biological systems is imperative to study the behaviour of dynamic systems that require the analysis of how their components interact in space. However, there are only a few formal tools that offer a convenient modelling of such systems. The traditional approach to construct and simulate 3D models is to build a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Although this approach may be computationally efficient and has been employed by many researchers over the years, it is not always intuitive since it does not provide a visual depiction of the modelled systems. Indeed, a visual modelling can help to conceive a mental image which eventually contributes to the understanding of the problem under study. Coloured Hybrid Petri Nets (HPNC) are a high-level representation of classical Petri nets that offer hybrid as well as spatial modelling of biological systems. In addition to their graphical representations, HPNC models are also scalable. This paper shows how HPNC can be used to construct and simulate systems that require three-dimensional as well as hybrid (stochastic/continuous) modelling. We use calcium diffusion in three dimensions to illustrate our main ideas. More specifically, we show that creating 3D models using HPNC can yield more flexible models as the structure can be easily scaled up and down by just modifying a few parameters. This advantage of convenient model configuration facilitates the design of different experiments without the need to alter the model structure.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jianlong Zhao</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yongchao Zhang</dc:creator>

<dc:description>The fault feature of the rolling bearing is difficult to extract when weak fault occurs and interference exists. The tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) can effectively extract the weak fault characteristic of the rolling bearing, but the manual selection of the Q-factor affects the decomposition result and only using TQWT presents interference. Aiming at the above problems, an adaptive tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (ATQWT) and spectral kurtosis (SK) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the method applies particle swarm optimization (PSO) to seek the optimized Q-factor for avoiding manual selection, which uses the kurtosis value of the transient impact component as the particle fitness function. The rolling bearing fault signal is decomposed into continuous oscillation component and transient impact component containing fault feature by the optimized Q-factor. Then, due to the presence of interference in the decomposition result of ATQWT, the SK analysis of the transient impact component is used to determine the frequency band of periodic impact component characterizing fault feature by fast kurtogram. Finally, the band-pass filter established through the above frequency band is employed to filter the interference in the transient impact component. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the ATQWT can highlight the periodic impact component characterizing rolling bearing fault feature, and the SK can filter interference in the transient impact component, which improves feature extraction effect and has great significance to enhance fault diagnosis accuracy of the rolling bearing. Compared with EEMD-TQWT and TQWT-SK, the fault feature extracted by the proposed method is prominent and effective.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Depending on the quality of the input substrates, process parameters, and postfermentation treatments, digestates may contain a broad spectrum of potentially toxic elements. We suspected that these contents may vary on a broad scale even under seemingly stable process conditions at the biogas plant. Digestates from four biogas plants were therefore continuously analyzed for their contents of phosphorus, nitrogen, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc over a period of six years. The input substrates varied between the plants (e.g., cattle and pig slurry and rye and maize silage), but were the same for each plant over the whole period. The N : P ratio of the digestates ranged from 2 to 24, with the digestate coming from cofermentation of pig slurry and energy crops (“DG Pig”) having the widest range of N : P ratio over the years. Heavy metal loads of all digestates and during all evaluations did not exceed the limits set by European or German legislation, but as previously expected, showed a large variability especially if cattle or pig manure were used as substrates. Copper content of Cattle slurry before digestion was 897.7 mg kg−1 DM in one case, and zinc content of DG Pig reached 590.2 mg kg−1 DM also once during the investigation. As a result, we strongly recommend to monitor especially phosphorus, copper, and zinc contents in digestates very closely and in short intervals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of herbicide-resistant weeds, including glyphosate-resistant (GR) biotypes in Ontario, Canada. A total of six field experiments were conducted over a two-year period (2018 and 2019) to determine the control of GR Canada fleabane (Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.) with currently available herbicides for winter wheat in Ontario. Winter wheat was not injured with any of the herbicides evaluated. Among herbicides evaluated, pyrasulfotole/bromoxynil (preformulated), 2,4-D ester, halauxifen, fluroxypyr/halauxifen (preformulated) + MCPA, pyrasulfotole/bromoxynil/fluroxypyr (preformulated), pyrasulfotole/bromoxynil/thiencarbazone (preformulated), pyrasulfotole/bromoxynil/thiencarbazone + MCPA, and fluroxypyr/halauxifen + pyroxsulam + MCPA controlled GR Canada fleabane 94–100% at 8 weeks after application (WAA) and reduced density 95–100% and biomass 97–100%. Reduced GR Canada fleabane interference with pyrasulfotole/bromoxynil/thiencarbazone + MCPA increased winter wheat yield 27% compared to the weedy control. GR Canada fleabane interference had no adverse effect on winter wheat yield with all other treatments. Based on these results, herbicide treatments that include 2,4-D, pyrasulfotole, or halauxifen can adequately control GR Canada fleabane in winter wheat.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Data-driven methods are very useful for streamflow forecasting when the underlying physical relationships are not entirely clear. However, obtaining an accurate data-driven model that is sufficiently performant for streamflow forecasting remains often challenging. This study proposes a new data-driven model that combined the variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the prediction models for daily streamflow forecasting. The prediction models include the autoregressive moving average (ARMA), the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), the support vector regression (SVR), and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The latest decomposition model, the VMD algorithm, was first applied to extract the multiscale features from the entire time series and to decompose them into several subseries, which were predicted after that using forecast models. The ensemble forecast was finally reconstructed by summing. Historical daily streamflow series recorded at the Wushan and Weijiabao hydrologic stations from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2014 in China were investigated using the proposed VMD-based models. Three quantitative evaluation indexes, including the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE), were used to evaluate and compare the predicted results of the proposed VMD-based models with two other models such as nondecomposition method (BPNN) and BPNN based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD-BPNN). Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the performance of the VMD-BPNN model under different forecast periods (1, 3, 5, and 7 days) was performed. The results evidenced that the proposed VMD-based models could always achieve good performance in the testing stage and had relatively good stability and representativeness. Specifically, the VMD-BPNN model considered both the prediction accuracy and computation efficiency. The results show that the reliability of the forecasting decreased as the foresight period increased. The model performed satisfactorily up to 7-d lead time. The VMD-BPNN model could be applied as a promising, reliable, and robust prediction tool for short-term streamflow forecasting modelling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The semispatial static allowable stress field was constructed by three-dimensional stress columns, and the analytical lower-bound solution of bearing capacity of Mohr–Coulomb foundation beneath circular uniformly distributed load was put forward for the first time. The influence of the amount of stress columns and soil shear strength parameters on the lower-bound solution of the foundation-bearing capacity is analyzed. The research showed that (1) when the number of stress columns is more than 9 (n &gt; 4) and the friction angle is less than 30°, the relative error between the lower-bound solution of the bearing capacity and exact solution is less than 6.6%, (2) the suggested analytical solution is applicable for common clayey materials; thus, the application scope of the analytical lower-bound solution is further expanded, and (3) the influence of cohesion on bearing capacity is linear. However, with the increase of the friction angle, the bearing capacity increases faster and faster under all cohesion levels. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method were verified by literature comparison.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Breast cancer metastases to the base of the skull with concomitant infiltration into the paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx are exceptionally rare with only small numbers of reported literatures. Greenberg et al. in 1981 described five clinical syndromes with regards to the base of skull metastases and the clinical presentation of each syndrome related to its anatomical location. Often, metastases to the base of the skull remain asymptomatic until the lesion has increased to a considerable size causing bony destruction and impingement to the surrounding structures. When involving the paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx, the most common presenting symptoms mimic those of rhinosinusitis and, hence, may delay the accurate diagnosis. We are reporting a case of base of skull metastasis from breast carcinoma, 23 years after the primary diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first case to report latent metastasis of more than 20 years.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Estimating the conveyance efficiency of traditional irrigation schemes systems is very important. It is because of understanding the volume of water lost along with the transportation facility, enhancing water usage and productivity, hence making better decisions about the utilization of water resources. The objective of the study was to determine water abstraction permit compliances and estimate conveyance efficiency and crop and water productivity of traditional irrigation systems in northern Tanzania. The task involved measurement of irrigation water flows to determine the amount of water abstraction, inflow (head) and outflow (tail) between the canals to determine the conveyance efficiency of the main, secondary, and tertiary canals of the traditional irrigation systems. Moreover, water and yield obtained at the farm level were determined. Results indicate that approximately 72% of water transported reaches the destined farm which produced maize (Zea mays L) yields of 1054.5 kg/ha, 892.4 kg/ha, and 875.156 kg/ha at downstream, midstream, and upstream which equals 0.41 kg/m3, 0.15 kg/m3, and 0.09 kg/m3, respectively, while about 28% of water is lost along the canals through evaporation, seepage, and deep percolation and overtopping. Consequently, water measured at furrow intakes in total was 3,500 L/s, equal to 23% more than the permitted amount of 2856.14 L/s at Usa River Catchment. Interventions to minimize water losses starting at the furrow’s intakes are urgently required in the current trend of the increasing demand for water resources for food production and schemes performance. Subsequently, more effective conveyance technologies and water management strategies other than canal lining are required.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The increase in demand for agricultural produce necessitates the continuous search for affordable, ecofriendly, readily available crop protectors, and food preservatives. Historically, the use of various chemicals was employed in controlling plant diseases and to maintain food quality. In the past few decades, several natural product-based alternatives have been discovered and projected as better alternatives to synthetic pesticides and other synthetic agrochemicals. Recent studies focusing on the application of different botanicals in crop protection and food preservation were carefully selected and reviewed. The application of plant extract in the biogenic preparation of nanoparticles was also reviewed. This review confirms that several natural products can be used as a safe replacement for synthetic agrochemicals. Different plant extracts have also served as feed for the synthesis of nanoparticle, which is increasingly applicable in crop protection and food preservation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Multienvironment testing is an important phase to study the interaction of G × E and to select stable hybrids for a broad environment or for a specific environment. To study the interaction of G × E and the stability of earliness and yield of Indonesian new sweet corn hybrids under different locations and seasons in West Java, Indonesia, eighteen hybrids were evaluated in six environments in West Java, Indonesia, and were analysed using parametric and nonparametric stability models, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), and GGE biplots. Results showed that the most promising sweet corn hybrids including hybrids G5 (SR 24 x SR 17) and G11 (SR 31 x SR 17) were identified. The parametric and nonparametric stability parameters and ASV were complement to the AMMI and GGE biplots in selecting stable and adaptable hybrids in terms of earliness and yield. G5 was selected as a high-response hybrid for grain yield to Jatinangor (E1, E2), Lembang (E3, E4), and Wanayasa (E5, E6), as well as earliness to Jatinangor (E2), Lembang (E3, E4), and Wanayasa (E5, E6). G5 sweet corn hybrid, therefore, is suggested to be extensively evaluated on farm and produced for smallholder farmers in West Java, Indonesia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Small areas of the wetter parts of southeast Australia including Tasmania support high-biomass “wet” eucalypt forests, including “mixed” forests consisting of mature eucalypts up to 100 m high with a rainforest understorey. In Tasmania, mixed forests transition to lower biomass rainforests over time. In the scientific and public debate on ways to mitigate climate change, these forests have received attention for their ability to store large amounts of carbon (C), but the contribution of soil C stocks to the total C in these two ecosystems has not been systematically researched, and consequently, the potential of wet eucalypt forests to serve as long-term C sinks is uncertain. This study compared soil C stocks to 1 m depth at paired sites under rainforest and mixed forests and found that there was no detectable difference of mean total soil C between the two forest types, and on average, both contained about 200 Mg·ha−1 of C. Some C in subsoil under rainforests is 3000 years old and retains a chemical signature of pyrogenic C, detectable in NMR spectra, indicating that soil C stocks are buffered against the effects of forest succession. The mean loss of C in biomass as mixed forests transition to rainforests is estimated to be about 260 Mg·ha−1 over a c. 400-year period, so the mature mixed forest ecosystem emits about 0.65 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 of C during its transition to rainforest. For this reason and because of the risk of forest fires, setting aside large areas of wet eucalypt forests as reserves in order to increase landscape C storage is not a sound strategy for long-term climate change mitigation. Maintaining a mosaic of managed native forests, including regenerating eucalypts, mixed forests, rainforests, and reserves, is likely to be the best strategy for maintaining landscape C stocks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in the world affecting the bladder and the kidney. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the main causative agent of 80–90% of community-acquired UTIs, about 40% of nosocomial UTIs, and 25% of recurrent UTIs. The field of proteomics has emerged as a great tool to analyze expressed proteins to identify possible biomarkers associated with many pathological states and, to the same extent, those associated with bacterial pathogenesis and their ability to cause recurrent infections. Here, in a descriptive cross-sectional pilot study, we employed proteomic techniques to investigate the effects of environmental stress on protein profiles of E. coli simulated by sequential passaging of samples from patients with UTIs to screen for unique proteins that arise under stressful environment and could aid in the early detection of UTIs. Four urine samples were collected from individuals with recurrent UTI and sequentially subcultured; protein samples were extracted from bacterial pellets and analyzed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). Protein spots of interest arising from changes in the protein profile were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and matched against known databases to identify related proteins. We identified ATPB_ECOBW, ASPA ECOLI, DPS ECOL6, and DCEB ECOLI as proteins associated with higher passaging. We concluded that passaging resulted in identifiable changes in the protein profile of E. coli, namely, proteins that are associated with survival and possible adaptation of bacteria, suggestive of factors contributing to antibiotic resistance and recurrent UTIs. Furthermore, our method could be further used to identify indicator-protein candidates that could be a part of a growing protein database to diagnose and identify causative agents in UTIs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Probiotics are live microorganisms which when consumed in large number together with a food promote the health of the consumer. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Ethiopian fermented Teff injera dough, Ergo, and Kocho products. A total of 90 LAB were isolated, of which 4 (4.44%) isolates showed 45.35–97.11% and 38.40–90.49% survival rates at pH values (2, 2.5, and 3) for 3 and 6 h, in that order. The four acid-tolerant isolates were found tolerant to 0.3% bile salt for 24 h with 91.37 to 97.22% rate of survival. The acid-and-bile salt-tolerant LAB isolates were found inhibiting some food-borne test pathogenic bacteria to varying degrees. All acid-and-bile-tolerant isolates displayed varying sensitivity to different antibiotics. The in vitro adherence to stainless steel plates of the 4 screened probiotic LAB isolates were ranged from 32.75 to 36.30% adhesion rate. The four efficient probiotic LAB isolates that belonged to Lactobacillus species were identified to the strain level using 16S rDNA gene sequence comparisons and, namely, were Lactobacillus plantarum strain CIP 103151, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. tolerans strain NBRC 15906, Lactobacillus paracasei strain NBRC 15889, and Lactobacillus plantarum strain JCM 1149. The four Lactobacillus strains were found to be potentially useful to produce probiotic products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the most cultured and available fish for Kenyan consumers, and therefore, any tilapine disease deprives them the valuable source of protein. Nile tilapia farm was diagnosed with severe concurrent black spot disease and multiple bacteriosis using gross lesions and parasitological, histopathology, and standard bacteriological procedures. A total of 25 fish were sampled and inspected, and all of them had raised, macroscopic 1 mm-sized black spot lesions. The mean intensity of black spots per fish was 728 with an abundance of 2–1740 metacercariae cysts per fish. A high intensity of black spot infestation was observed in the fins (43.9%), skin and underlying muscles (18.3%), and gills (18%). In addition, histopathological data confirmed presence of a metacercaria of Neascus spp. as the aetiological agent of black spot disease. Furthermore, a thick fibrous capsule around the metacercaria, black pigment melanomacrophages, and moderate muscle atrophy were observed. The most prevalent bacteria isolated were Aeromonas, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus. Physicochemical parameters of pond water were temperature (28.2°C), dissolved oxygen (4.2 mgl−1), pH (8.5), ammonia free nitrogen (15.8 mgl−1), alkalinity (112 mgl−1), hardness (68 mgl−1), nitrites (0.058 mgl−1), nitrates (58 mgl−1), and phosphates (0.046 mgl−1). However, the levels of nitrates, nitrites, alkalinity, and ammonia free nitrogen exceeded the recommended limits. In conclusion, these findings suggest that coinfections by these organisms coupled by water quality-related stress can be associated with low-grade mortality observed in postfingerling tilapia as well as reduced growth. The authors recommended immediate destocking, thorough disinfection, and control of piscivorous birds. Moreover, attention ought to be geared towards prevention of parasitic infestations in fish so as to minimize fish deaths related to secondary bacteriosis. Further experimental studies should be carried out to elucidate the relationship of these pathogens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>High extrusion temperatures may compromise the functionality of probiotics in dry food. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the effects of two types of microencapsulation techniques, different encapsulating agents, and 120 days of storage on the viability of a commercial probiotic product and (ii) investigate fecal microbiota populations and fecal characteristics of adult cats fed with diets supplemented with probiotics. Three experimental treatments were evaluated: T1, commercial feed (control); T2, commercial kibbles coated with probiotics; and T3, commercial feed supplemented with freeze-dried probiotics and fructooligosaccharides. Fructooligosaccharides and gum arabic were used as encapsulating agents for freeze drying and spray drying and a pool containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a probiotic. Diets were provided to 18 adult cats for 20 days. Feed samples were evaluated microbiologically, and feces were characterized according to their microbial content, pH, and fecal score. Freeze drying was more effective in maintaining microbial viability. Microcapsules prepared using fructooligosaccharides as encapsulants had the highest bacterial count: 8.74 log CFU/g of lactic acid bacteria and 8.75 log CFU/g of enterococci. Probiotics and synbiotics positively modulated (P&lt;0.05) the fecal microbiota of cats, increasing the lactic acid bacteria counts from 3.65 to 4.87 and 5.07 log CFU/g, respectively. Microbial viability decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) after storage, demonstrating the need for effective protection mechanisms against extrinsic agents. In conclusion, the supplementation of cat diets with probiotics positively affected the gut microbiota. However, the results reinforce that probiotic microorganisms must be incorporated into the animal feed via effective mechanisms to withstand harsh processing conditions and storage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fish bacterial pathogens cause diseases which result in a considerable economic impact on the aquaculture industry, necessitating the use of antimicrobials for their control. However, intensive and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials has led to increased occurrence of drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria, as well as normal flora. The aim of the current study was to determine the susceptibility patterns of bacteria isolated from fish, with respect to some commonly used antibiotics and disinfectants. Bacteria were isolated between December 2017 and April 2018 from farmed Nile tilapia, African catfish, goldfish, and koi carp in Kirinyaga County, Kenya. Antibiotic and disinfectant susceptibility patterns of 48 isolates belonging to the genera Aeromonas, Proteus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Salmonella, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Serratia, and Micrococcus were established using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method and agar well diffusion technique, respectively. The antibiotics evaluated included ampicillin, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and chloramphenicol, while the disinfectants tested were quaternary ammonium compound, formalin, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and iodine. All the bacteria except Micrococcus, Escherichia, and Salmonella species showed multiple drug resistance patterns. Streptococcus showed resistance to six antibiotics, while Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Serratia were resistant to five antibiotics. The multiple antibiotic resistance index ranged from 0.1 to 0.8, with Streptococcus spp. having the highest score value. All the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, while co-trimoxazole and ampicillin showed the highest resistance at 73% (n = 34) and 62% (n = 31), respectively. Most of the disinfectants showed antibacterial activity with varying magnitudes. The isolates were 100% sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and formalin, but were resistant to sodium hypochlorite at recommended user-dilution. The study has shown that some of the bacterial isolates were resistant to common antibiotics and disinfectants; thus, it is recommended to include an antibiogram whenever making any therapeutic decision. The resistant bacteria may transmit resistance genes to other fish bacteria and also to human bacteria, thus making it difficult to treat the resultant disease(s); thus, there is a possibility that these resistant bacteria may be transmitted to humans who consume or handle the carrier fish. It is, therefore, advisable that fish are cooked properly before consumption, so as to kill bacteria that may be present.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Crude oil pollution has consistently deteriorated all environmental compartments through the cycle of activities of the oil and gas industries. However, there is a growing need to identify microbes with catabolic potentials to degrade these pollutants. This research was conducted to identify bacteria with functional degradative genes. A crude oil-polluted soil sample was obtained from an aged spill site at Imo River, Ebubu, Komkom community, Nigeria. Bacteria isolates were obtained and screened for hydrocarbon degradation potential by turbidometry assay. Plasmid and chromosomal DNA of the potential degraders were further screened for the presence of selected catabolic genes (C230, Alma, Alkb, nahAC, and PAHRHD(GP)) and identified by molecular typing. Sixteen (16) out of the fifty (50) isolates obtained showed biodegradation activity in a liquid broth medium at varying levels. Bacillus cereus showed highest potential for this assay with an optical density of 2.450 @ 600 nm wavelength. Diverse catabolic genes resident in plasmids and chromosomes of the isolates and, in some cases, both plasmid and chromosomes of the same organism were observed. The C230 gene was resident in &gt;50% of the microbial population tested, while other genes occurred in lower proportions with the least observed in nahAC and PAHRHD. These organisms can serve as potential bioremediation agents.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Soil stabilization is a mechanical or chemical alteration of one or more soil properties to create an improved soil material possessing the desired engineering properties. The aim of this article was to review bioenzyme-based soil stabilization techniques with an emphasis on bioenzymes production, mechanism of soil stabilization and future challenges, and opportunities of the sector. Soils are stabilized to increase strength and durability or to prevent erosion and dust generation. Cost-effective soil stabilization technology has been a fundamental part of any construction and is very important for economic growth in any country. In some cases, construction has been challenged due to the high cost of soil stabilization processes. Besides, methods of stabilizations using common stabilizing agents are getting costly. Currently, there is a growing interest to identify new and green technology to improve construction techniques and to expand the road network. Therefore, the search for new materials and improved techniques to process the local materials has received an increased focus. For developing countries, bioenzymes are now creating an opportunity to improve soil stability with tremendous effectiveness in the overall process of soil stabilization. In the world, bioenzymes have been used in different projects for several years and are generally proprietary products, often of patented formulation that needs intensive field tests. Currently, the use and production of bioenzymes is becoming the most promising key for the advancement of a country by saving time, energy, and finance. It also reduces environmental pollution due to carbon emission by the conventional stabilizers. Thus, a better understanding of this emerging technology is of utmost importance to exploit any improvement it can offer to soil stability. With little research and practice, it is possible to produce soil stabilizing bioenzymes using local raw materials. Due to this, production of low cost, easily and widely applicable, and environmentally friendly enzymatic formulations from locally available raw materials should be the interest of research and academic institutes of any country.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Anteneh Ademe Mengistu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Biotic and abiotic factors cause an enormous amount of yield and economical loss. However, endophytes can play a significant role in enhancing the tolerance of plants. Endophytes systematically colonize different parts of the host, but plants use a variety of defense mechanisms towards microbial infection. However, they have to survive the oxidative environments, and endophytes like Enterobacter sp. encode superoxide dismutases, catalases, and hydroperoxide reductases to cope up the oxidative stress during colonization. On the contrary, others produce subtilomycin which binds with flagella to affect flg22-induced plant defense. The behavior of endophytes can be affected by different genes in hydrolase activity when they come into contact with the host plant. The lifestyle of endophytes is influenced by environmental factors, the host, and microbial genotypes, as well as an imbalance in nutrient exchange between the microbe and the host. For instance, induction of PiAMT1 in root endophyte Piriformospora indica indicates depletion of nitrogen which plays as a triggering factor for activation of the saprotrophic program. Microbes enhance disease resistance through induced systemic resistance (ISR), and Bacillus cereus triggers ISR against Botrytis cinerea through an accumulation of the PR1 protein and activates MAPK signaling and WRKY53 gene expression by the JA/ET signaling pathway. Similarly, Trichoderma arundinaceum produces trichodiene that affects Botrytis cinerea through induction of defense-related genes encoding salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonate (JA). Overall, endophytes can play a vital role in disease management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Understanding the honeybee gut bacteria is an essential aspect as honeybees are the primary pollinators of many crops. In this study, the honeybee-associated gut bacteria were investigated by targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes using the Illumina MiSeq. The adult worker was captured in an urban area in a dense settlement. In total, 83,018 reads were obtained, revealing six phyla from 749 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The gut was dominated by Proteobacteria (58% of the total reads, including Enterobacteriaceae 28.2%, Erwinia 6.43%, and Klebsiella 4.90%), Firmicutes (29% of the total reads, including Lactococcus garvieae 13.45%, Lactobacillus spp. 8.19%, and Enterococcus spp. 4.47%), and Actinobacteria (8% of the total reads, including Bifidobacterium spp. 7.96%). Many of these bacteria belong to the group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which was claimed to be composed of beneficial bacteria involved in maintaining a healthy host. The honeybee was identified as Apis nigrocincta based on an identity BLAST search of its COI region. This study is the first report on the gut microbial community structure and composition of A. nigrocincta from Indonesia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Dementia is an ominous neurological disease. Scientists proposed a link between its occurrence and the presence of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). The long-term sequels of anti-Toxoplasma premunition, chiefly dominated by TNF-α, on the neurons and their receptors as the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is tangled in cognition and synaptic plasticity, are still not clear. IGF-1R mediates its action via IGF-1, and its depletion is incorporated in the pathogenesis of dementia. The activated TNF-α signaling pathway induces NF-κβ that may induce or inhibit neurogenesis. This study speculates the potential impact of anti-Toxoplasma immune response on the expression of IGF-1R in chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis. The distributive pattern of T. gondii cysts was studied in association with TNF-α serum levels, the in situ expression of NF-κβ, and IGF-1R in mice using the low virulent ME-49 T. gondii strain. There was an elevation of the TNF-α serum level (p value ≤ 0.004) and significant upsurge in NF-κβ whereas IGF-1R was of low abundance (p value &lt; 0.05) compared to the controls. TNF-α had a strong positive correlation with the intracerebral expression of NF-κβ (r value ≈ 0.943, p value ≈ 0.005) and a strong negative correlation to IGF-1R (r value -0.584 and -0.725 for area% and O.D., respectively). This activated TNF-α/NF-κβ keeps T. gondii under control at the expense of IGF-1R expression, depriving neurons of the effect of IGF-1, the receptor’s ligand. We therefore deduce that T. gondii immunopathological reaction may be a road paver for developing dementia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present communication describes a battery of toxicity studies that include an acute oral toxicity, a subacute twenty-eight-day repeated oral dose toxicity, and genotoxicity studies on a herbal formulation CinDura® (GMCT). This proprietary herbal composition contains the extracts of the Garcinia mangostana fruit rind (GM) and the Cinnamomum tamala leaf (CT). The toxicological evaluations were performed following the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The acute oral toxicity study in Wistar rats suggests that the median lethal dose of CinDura® is at least 2000 mg/kg body weight. Acute dermal and eye irritation tests in New Zealand white rabbits indicate that the test item is nonirritant to the skin and eyes. A twenty-eight-day repeated dose oral toxicity study was conducted in male and female Wistar rats using daily doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight, followed by a fourteen-day reversal period for two satellite groups. The CinDura®-supplemented animals did not show any sign of toxicity on their body weights, organ weights, and on the hematobiochemical parameters. The gross pathology and histopathological examinations indicated no treatment-related changes in the experimental animals. Overall, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of the herbal blend is 1000 mg/kg body weight, the highest tested dose. Also, the results of the bacterial reverse mutation test and the erythrocyte micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow suggest that CinDura® (GMCT) is neither mutagenic nor clastogenic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The reproductive ability of sows is the principle of continuous and efficient production, based on such traits as the number of piglets, the total number of parities, and the period of economic use. Currently, SNPs associated with the TNB and NBA are presented in the PigQTLdb. The aim of this work was the assessment of the SNP effects on the litter traits in Large White (LW, n = 502) and Landrace (LN, n = 432) sow breeds in a farm in Russia. 9 SNPs (SNP_1: rs80956812; SNP_2: rs81471381; SNP_3: rs80891106; SNP_4: rs81399474; SNP_5: rs81421148; SNP_6: rs81242222; SNP_7: rs81319839; SNP_8: rs81312912; SNP_9: rs80962240) were selected for the study. Associative analysis was performed using the GLM procedure in R version 3.5.1. The analysis of reproductive traits was carried out according to the results of the first parity, the second and subsequent parities, and totals for lifetime of sows. The significant effect on litter traits in LW was determined for SNP rs80956812, SNP rs81471381, SNP rs81421148, and SNP rs81399474. The significant effect on litter traits in LN was determined for SNP rs81421148 and SNP rs81319839. AKT3 gene was identified as perspective candidate gene, whose biological functions, as well as the results obtained in our work and in other studies, indicate its potential role in the reproductive process regulation in pigs. In general, the data obtained help to explain the genetic mechanisms of reproductive traits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nora virus (NV) is a picorna-like virus that contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The virus infects Drosophila melanogaster with no known characterized phenotype. In this study, geotaxis assays and longevity analyses were used to determine if Nora virus infection affects D. melanogaster’s locomotor ability. In addition, Drosophila C virus (DCV), a well-characterized D. melanogaster virus, was used as a positive control, as it has previously shown a locomotor defect in infected flies. Stocks infected with NV (NV+) and DCV (DCV+) and virus-free (NV-/DCV-) stocks were established. Over a 3-year period, approximately 2,500 virgin female flies were tested for geotaxis and longevity using Kaplan–Meier analyses, as well as the Cox Proportional Hazards regression for survivorship. There was a significant decrease in the geotaxis when the D. melanogaster flies were infected with Nora virus compared to uninfected controls, but no difference was found between DCV+ and NV+ trials. There were not significant differences in longevity between the three groups. This is the first time that a phenotype has been recorded in association with Nora virus infection. Overall, the data demonstrate that geotaxis dysfunction may be a phenotypic hallmark of Nora virus infection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Pemphigus is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease which can cause blisters and mucocutaneous erosions. ABO secretor refers to those who secrete ABO blood group antigens based on their blood type in body fluids such as saliva, sweat, tears, semen, and serum. Previous studies showed that nonsecretor people are more prone to certain autoimmune diseases. Aim. The aim of this study was to determine the ABO secretor status in the saliva of patients with pemphigus vulgaris. Materials and Methods. This case-control study was conducted on 35 patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 35 healthy controls. The two groups were matched for age and gender. Pemphigus vulgaris diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and direct immunofluorescence microscopy. ABO blood grouping was done, and 5 ml of unstimulated saliva was collected to determine secretor status. Secretors were recognized from nonsecretors by the Wiener agglutination inhibition test. Results were extracted by using statistical chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. Results. 16 male and 19 female patients aged 49.43 ± .12.37 years were compared with 16 male and 19 female controls aged 46.43 ± 11.88 years. The most frequent blood group among case and control groups was O (54.3% and 60%, respectively). There was no significant difference in blood groups (P=0.73). 90% of the samples were ABO secretors. The patient group included 31 (88.6%) and the control group included 32 (91.4%) ABO secretors; there was no significant difference between the two groups (P=1.000). Conclusion. In this study, we observed that the people with nonsecretor status in comparison with the people with secretor status are not more susceptible to develop pemphigus vulgaris.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a new type of connection system was proposed for joints between GFRP-wood composite sandwich beams and columns which were made of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) face sheets and southern pine wood cores. The connection system comprised steel angles anchored to the column, and the beam was bolted to the angles. Six different connection system configurations were tested to understand the static behavior of the connection system under different parameters including the length of the beam-closed limb and the presence of ribs. The failure modes of the connection system obtained in tests were of three types: yield failure of the angle steels, local crushing failure of the GFRP-wood composite sandwich beam, and tensile failure of the bolt on the beam-closed limb. The initial rotational stiffness values of the three specimens with ribs were 113.75%, 119.56%, and 227.94% higher than the corresponding three specimens without ribs. And the ductility of connection improved by up to 30.28% due to the presence of stiffener ribs. Based on the tests, the bearing capacity and stiffness of the connection system were predicted. For the specimens without ribs, the method in Eurocode 3 was adopted for bearing capacity and stiffness predictions. For the specimens with ribs, a mechanical model was established for bearing capacity and initial stiffness predictions, which was solved according to the corresponding stress features and failure modes. The analytical results were in good agreement with the experimental results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, with 1–7% prevalence in the female population. It is observed in various locations of the human body, and large bowel endometriosis is the most common extrapelvic site, affecting about 5 to 12% of all women who present endometriosis. This study aimed to report an interesting images related to stenosing large bowel endometriosis that was possible to be diagnosed only by surgical intervention. Hence, this pathology is a diagnostic challenge and should be remembered between differential diagnoses of nonspecific or even alarming symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We report two Hong Kong children with severe generalized epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), the most severe form of EBS, without a family history of EBS. EBS is a rare genodermatosis usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion although rare autosomal recessive cases have been reported. Genetic studies in these patients showed that the first case was due to a novel de novo heterozygous variant, c.377T&gt;G (NM_000526.5 (c.377T&gt;G, p.Leu126Arg)) in the KRT14 gene and the second case was due to a rare de novo heterozygous variant c.527A&gt;G (NM_000424.4, c.527A&gt;G, p.Asn176Ser) in the KRT5 gene. To our knowledge, the c.377T&gt;G variant in the KRT14 gene has not been previously reported, and the c.527A&gt;G variant in the KRT5 gene is a rare cause of severe generalized EBS. In severe generalized EBS, infants exhibit severe symptoms at the onset; however, they tend to improve with time. A precise genetic diagnosis in these two cases aided in counseling the families concerning the prognosis in their affected children and the recurrence risk for future pregnancies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We study a simple mathematical model describing the dynamics of a wild-type pest insects population experiencing competition from sterile insects (one-sided competition). This model can be used for conceiving control strategies based on the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) or the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT), aiming to reduce or eradicate Red Palm Weevil (RPW) populations in some target regions. We show that suppression may occur for continuous and periodic release strategies for various intraspecific and interspecific submodels except in the case of a single release strategy where a strong Allee effect is required.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A woman in her late sixties presented with severe hyponatremia and acute kidney injury (AKI) as consequence of psychogenic polydipsia and acute urinary retention due to urinary tract infection. Urinary catheterization promptly drained 5.5 L of urine with resulting polyuria, leading to an initial swift raise in plasma (P) sodium concentration, disregarding the course of fluid resuscitation. After the polyuric phase, normal range P-sodium levels were reestablished by oral water restriction. Treatment with psychoactive drugs, e.g., zuclopentixol, may have contributed to the severity of the condition. There are few published reports regarding water intoxication and urinary retention, but none reflecting severe hyponatremia precipitated by acute urinary retention in a patient with polydipsia. By this report, we illustrate the detrimental consequences on water and electrolyte homeostasis of urinary retention and polydipsia resulting in acute water intoxication. The purpose of presenting this case is firstly to draw attention to the potentially fatal combination of polydipsia and postrenal acute kidney injury, where the kidneys are unable to correct the enormous excess water, then to focus on the difficulty in correcting hypervolemic hyponatraemia in the context of polyuria after relief of urinary retention, and finally, to point out that patients in treatment with antipsychotics may have further worsening of electrolyte derangement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. A dental loupe is a tool used by many dentists and dental students to improve visual field and performance. This study aims to assess the practices and attitudes about dental magnification loupes and their relationship to musculoskeletal disorders. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 400 dental students and dentists in four dental colleges in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The mean age was 28.35 years (SD = 8.50), and 56% of the participants were male. Also, 70.75% were students or interns, while 29.25% were dentists. Data gathering was conducted using a questionnaire that was composed of four sections: demographic, magnification devices usage, attitude toward dental loupes, and the Nordic questionnaire to assess musculoskeletal disorders. Results. A total of 66% of participants had used dental magnification tools before, but only 12.25% were using dental loupes at the time of the study. The main reported advantages of dental loupes were comfort in vision (59.25%) and improved work accuracy (53%), while the main disadvantage was difficulty in visual measurement (28.5%). A total of 73.25% reported that price was the main barrier to the use of dental loupes. Lower back (63.5%), neck (65.25%), and shoulder (46.25%) pain were the most frequently reported areas of discomfort. There was a significant relationship (&lt;0.05) between the use of dental loupes and lowered levels of reported discomfort in the lower back, neck, shoulders, elbows, upper back, and feet. Conclusion. There are few dental professionals who use dental loupes in Saudi Arabia. There was a significant relationship between dental loupes use and reduction of musculoskeletal disorders among dental students and dentists.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Lei Ge</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Qiang Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Based on the method of dynamic programming, this paper uses analysis methods governed by the nonlinear and inhomogeneous partial differential equation to study modern portfolio management problems with stochastic volatility, incomplete markets, limited investment scope, and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). In this paper, a three-level Crank–Nicolson finite difference scheme is used to determine numerical solutions under this general setting. One of the main contributions of this paper is to apply this three-level technology to solve the portfolio selection problem. In addition, we have used a technique to deal with the nonlinear term, which is another novelty in performing the Crank–Nicolson algorithm. The Crank–Nicolson algorithm has also been extended to third-order accuracy by performing Richardson’s extrapolation. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is much higher than the traditional finite difference method. Lastly, experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ethnopharmacological Relevance. Gegen Qinlian decoction (GGQLD) is an effective formula treatment for rotavirus enteritis (RVE), which has been applied for 1900 years. It consists of 4 herbal medicines corresponding to the four roles “monarch, minister, assistant, and guide,” which is the basic rule of prescription composition in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, its active ingredients and therapeutic mechanism on RVE have not been fully investigated. Materials and Methods. In this study, a network pharmacology-based strategy was used to elucidate the mechanism of GGQLD for the treatment of RVE. Oral bioavailability and drug-likeness were taken as the judgment criteria to search the active ingredients of GGQLD in traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP). The affinity between protein and ingredients was further determined using the similarity ensemble approach to find the corresponding targets. According to the genes related to enteritis in GeneCards database, the key targets were screened by intersections between drug and disease targets. And the therapeutic mechanism was predicted using the protein-protein interactions (PPIs), the Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, which was verified by detecting calcium ion concentration with the fluorescent probe. Result. 130 active ingredients were screened from GGQLD, including (R)-canadine, moupinamide, formononetin, and other flavonoids. They act on a total of 366 targets, which is mainly distributed in the biological process of hormone binding or signaling pathways of neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, serotonergic synapse, and calcium signaling pathway. Furthermore, serotonin receptors, adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors, and dopamine receptors in the enteric nervous system may be the key targets of RVE treatment by GGQLD. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that the potential mechanism that GGQLD can effectively improve the symptoms of RVE may depend on the regulation of calcium ions, serotonin, and gastrointestinal hormone ion that could mutually affect the intestinal nervous system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common serious problem affecting critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU). It increases their morbidity, mortality, length of ICU stay, and long-term risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods. A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Jordan. Medical records of patients admitted to the medical ICU between 2013 and 2015 were reviewed. We aimed to identify the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI. Acute kidney injury network (AKIN) classification was used to define and stage AKI. Results. 2530 patients were admitted to medical ICU, and the incidence of AKI was 31.6%, mainly in stage 1 (59.4%). In multivariate analysis, increasing age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.3), P = 0.0001) and higher APACHE II score (OR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.2–1.7), P = 0.001) were predictors of AKI, with 20.4% of patients started on hemodialysis. At the time of discharge, 58% of patients with AKI died compared to 51.3% of patients without AKI (P = 0.05). 88% of patients with AKIN 3 died by the time of discharge compared to patients with AKIN 2 and 1 (75.3% and 61.2% respectively, P = 0.001). Conclusion. AKI is common in ICU patients, and it increases mortality and morbidity. Close attention for earlier detection and addressing risk factors for AKI is needed to decrease incidence, complications, and mortality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Frequent failure of the walking wheel seriously restricts the performance of the whole shearer. To reduce the failure rate and improve the working performance of the walking wheel, the meshing characteristics of the tooth pin are researched. The dynamic state equations of the walking wheel and the contact force model of tooth pin meshing are established. The rigid-flexible coupling simulation model of tooth pin meshing is built. The load distribution characteristics of the walking wheel are analyzed, as well as the effects of impact load amplitude and duration. Results show that the curve of the longitudinal load distribution coefficient (Kβ) of the contact area is W-shaped, with a maximum of 1.325 at the moment of a single tooth contact. The end of the transition curve is the most serious position of the longitudinal load imbalance at the tooth root. In addition, on the impact moment, Kβ tends to decrease and maximum stress obviously increases with the increase in impact load under 40%; the material at the contact position will fail under an extra 39% instantaneous impact load. Furthermore, with the impact load of 30%, the influence of load impact duration under 0.5 s on the meshing characteristics of the walking wheel is relatively faint. The results provide some guidance for the design optimization of the walking wheel and provide a reference for improving the reliability of the shearer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Food image detection plays an essential role in visual object detection, considering its applicability in solutions that improve people’s nutritional status and thus their health-care. At present, most food detection technologies are aimed at Western food and Japanese food, but few at Chinese foods. In this work, we exert effort to establish a Chinese food image dataset called CF-108 that can be used as an essential data basis for Chinese food image detection. The CF-108 dataset contains most Chinese dishes and covers large variations in presentations of the same category. In addition, we introduce a training architecture that replaces the traditional convolution in mask region convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) with depthwise separable convolution, namely, Mask R-DSCNN, to reduce the expensive computation cost. Experiments demonstrate that Mask R-DSCNN can significantly reduce resource consumption and improve Chinese food images’ detection efficiency without hurting too much accuracy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To assess sex-based differences in the prevalence of risk factor, their management, and differences in the prognosis among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Sri Lanka. Methods. Patients diagnosed with ACS were recruited from hospitals throughout the island. The Joint European Societies guidelines were used to assess recommended targets for coronary heart disease risk factors, and the GRACE score was used to assess the post-ACS prognosis. Age-adjusted regression was performed to calculate odds ratios for men versus women in risk factor control. Results. A total of 2116 patients, of whom 1242 (58.7%) were men, were included. Significant proportion of women were nonsmokers; OR = 0.11 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.13). The prevalence of hypertension (p&lt;0.001), diabetes (p&lt;0.001), and dyslipidemia (p=0.004) was higher in women. The LDL-C target was achieved in a significantly higher percentage of women (12.6%); OR = 0.33 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.05). When stratified by age, no significant differences were observed in achieving the risk factor targets or management strategies used except for fasting blood sugar (p&lt;0.05) where more men achieved control target in both age categories. Majority of the ACS patients had either high or intermediate risk for one-year mortality as per the GRACE score. In-hospital and 1-year mean mortality risk was significantly higher among men of less than 65 years of age (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions. Smoking is significantly lower among Sri Lankan women diagnosed with ACS. However, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were more prevalent among them. There was no difference in primary and secondary preventive strategies and management in both sexes but could be further improved in both groups.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Backgroud. To observe the effects of Liuyu decoction on qi stagnation and dampness obstruction syndrome of metabolic syndrome related to atypical antipsychotics . Methods. 154 schizophrenics who met both the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome and qi stagnation and dampness obstruction syndrome were randomly divided into 2 : 1 groups. The PANSS and Tess were assessed before treatment and at the end of first month, second month, and third month after treatment; blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and cholesterol were also measured at the same four time points. On the basis of continuous antipsychotic treatment, the study group took Liuyu decoction, and the control group took placebo. Results. Of the 154 cases, 102 were in the study group and 52 in the control group. Before and after treatment, there was a slight increase but no significant difference in blood pressure, blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, cholesterol, TG, DHL, and LHL in two groups (P&gt;0.05) and also between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). The body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and BMI in the study group decreased, while that in the control group increased from the dividing group to the end of study. At the end of the third month, there was a significant difference in the body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and BMI between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). Before and after treatment, there was a significant difference in positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general symptoms, and PANSS in two groups, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The negative symptoms, general symptoms, PANSS, and TESS in the study group were lighter than that in the control group after treatment. Conclusion. Liuyu decoction is not only beneficial to the treatment in body constitution of metabolic syndrome in qi stagnation and dampness obstruction but also beneficial to the improvement of such patients’ mental symptoms and side effects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The swirl burner with a prechamber was used in a 14 MW pulverized-coal combustion experiment to investigate the influence of inner and secondary air ratios (ISA/OSA) on the combustion characteristic and flame shape in this work. The temperatures and species concentrations in the prechamber were measured via the flue gas analyzer and thermocouples. The flame shape beyond the prechamber outlet was captured by using a high-speed camera. The results showed that the combustion efficiency was increased and low nitrogen combustion was achieved by adopting the swirl burner with a prechamber. The high temperature corrosion and slagging phenomenon did not occur in the prechamber. The influence of ISA/OSA on temperature and species concentration profiles at different areas in the prechamber was different. The flame shape size exhibited an inflection point with increasing ISA/OSA. Considering, comprehensively, the temperature peak, near wall temperature, oxygen-free zone, CO concentration, flame length, flame diameter, and divergence angle, the case of ISA/OSA =1 : 2 had great processing on combustion efficiency and NOx emission. Thus, ISA/OSA = 1 : 2 was selected as the optimized case under experiment conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. We investigated the prognostic significance of pretreatment systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Methods. Present retrospective cohort analysis investigated consecutive 154 LAPC patients who received radical CRT. The SIRI was defined as: SIRI=neutrophil×monocyte/lymphocyte counts. Ideal SIRI cutoff(s) influencing overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) results were sought by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The primary endpoint was the interaction between the SIRI and OS results. Results. The median follow-up, PFS, and OS durations were 14.3 (range: 2.9-74.6), 7.9 [%95 confidence interval (CI): 5.7-10.1), and 14.7 months (%95 CI: 11.4-18.0) for the entire cohort, respectively. ROC curve analyses determined the ideal SIRI cutoff that exhibiting a significant link with OS and PFS outcomes at the rounded 1.6 point (AUC: 74.3%; sensitivity: 73.8%; specificity: 70.1%).The SIRI &lt;1.6 patients (N=58) had significantly superior median PFS (13.8 versus 6.7 months; P&lt;0.001) and OS (28.6 versus 12.6 months; P&lt;0.001) lengths than SIRI ≥1.6 patients (N=96), respectively. Although the N0 (versus N1; P&lt;0.05) and CA 19-9 ≤90 U/mL (versus &gt;90 U/mL) appeared as the other significant associates of better OS and PFS in univariate analyses, yet the results of multivariate analyses confirmed the SIRI &lt;1.6 as the independent indicator of superior OS and PFS (P&lt;0.001 for each). Conclusion. Pretreatment SIRI is a novel independent prognosticator that may further enhance the conventional tumor-node-metastases staging system in a more precise prediction of the OS and PFS outcomes of LAPC patients after radical CRT.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, the security analysis of a color image encryption algorithm based on Hopfield chaotic neural network is given. The original chaotic image encryption algorithm includes permutation encryption and diffusion encryption. The result of cryptanalysis shows that the chaotic sequences generated by this algorithm are independent of plaintext image, and there exist equivalent permutation key and equivalent diffusion key. Therefore, according to chosen-plaintext attack, the equivalent diffusion key and the equivalent permutation key can be obtained by choosing two special plaintext images and the corresponding ciphertext images, respectively, and the plaintext image is further recovered from the ciphertext image. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation experiment results verify the effectiveness of the analytical method. Finally, some improved suggestions for the original encryption algorithm are proposed to promote the security.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jianguo Liu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mingyu Zhao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Using data from 2008 to 2017 regarding the service sector in 11 cities of the Hebei Province, this study measures the degree of agglomeration and efficiency of service subsectors, analyzes their spatiotemporal evolution, and discusses the interactive relationship between them using panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) models and GMM dynamic panel model. The findings are summarized as follows: (1) from 2008 to 2017, service subsectors in Hebei’s cities have a high degree of agglomeration and benefit significantly from specialization; (2) the service in Hebei’s cities is severely inefficient (i.e., efficiency loss is grave). The empirical results of PVAR models reveal that service sector agglomeration is primarily reliant on its own development momentum and while that can improve technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency, it can also inhibit technical change efficiency. The variance decomposition results reveal that service sector efficiency is influenced more significantly by itself than by service sector agglomeration. With the passage of time, the self-influence of efficiency decreases and the influence of service sector agglomeration on efficiency increases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The physicomechanical deterioration characteristics of sandstone subjected to H2SO4, HCl, and H2O solutions of different pH values are studied by the method of long-term accelerated immersion. The quantitative relationships between the damage variables based on CT (computer tomographic identification technology) numbers and the immersion time, the uniaxial compressive strength, the peak point strain, and the elastic modulus of rock samples are analyzed. The test results indicate that the pH value of immersion solutions, the dissolution rate of Ca2+ and Na+, and the quality change of rock samples show visible stage characteristics under acidic environment. With the soaking time extended, the pH value of solutions increases gradually, and the quality change of rock samples decreases gradually. The smaller the pH value of immersion solutions is, the higher the dissolution rate of Ca2+ and Na+ is. However, the cation dissolution rate under a weak acid environment with a high pH value has little difference with that under the distilled water (pH = 7). With the increase of the soaking time and the acidity, the compaction stage of rock samples becomes longer, the elastic stage becomes shorter, the deterioration degree of mechanical parameters becomes more extensive, and the destruction of sandstone samples shows ductility characteristics increasingly. The corrosion degree of corroded sandstone samples is quantitatively represented by microscopic damage variables based on CT numbers. The regression analysis results show that damage variables of acid-corroded sandstone samples have a power function relationship with soaking time and an exponential function relationship with peak strength, peak point strain, and elastic modulus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recently, the use of nanomaterials (i.e., Nano-Silica (NS) and Nano-SiC(NC)) to improve the mechanical properties and durability performances of cement-based materials has received considerable attention. This work presents the effects of nanoparticles (NS), the specimen size, and the water-reducing agent on the antipullout strength between the reinforcement and cement mortar on the basis of the laboratory antipullout tests. The mechanism is, then, validated by the microscopic analysis with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results show that NS can accelerate the hydration reaction of cement, produce more Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH) gel, and increase the density of the cement mortar, thereby improving the microstructure and antipullout strength. The moderate NS (1.0%) is recommended to improve antipullout between the reinforcement and cement mortar. Besides, the specimen size and water-reducing agent have an obvious influence on the antipullout strength. These results would provide guidance on the design or construction of the cement mortar with reinforcement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stability of permeable soils near large-scale water reservoirs for paved and unpaved road pavements is all too frequently compromised due to excessive seepage and the climatic conditions of that area. In this research, a multilevel research approach was adopted by conducting a comparative study of the microspectroscopy through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to investigate the maximum absorbance correlation along with mechanical investigations (such as the compressive strength, modified proctor test, California bearing ratio test, and swell percentage test). The native low plastic soil sample (CL) was blended with varying percentages of petroleum additives (bitumen and used motor oil) independently at 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, and 20%. A comparison of results in the case of bitumen and used motor oil revealed that a decrease in Atterberg’s limits occurred accompanied by an increase of bitumen blending percentage, while used motor oil (UMO) increased the plastic limit. Maximum dry density (MDD) increases while optimum moisture content (OMC) decreases with the increase in bitumen. Used motor oil (UMO) initially (up to 4%) increased the MDD and subsequently decreased it. Investigative reports show that bitumen causes a decrease in swell percentage and increases California bearing ratio (CBR), whereas UMO causes a continuous increase in percentage swell and decrease in CBR. The addition of bitumen in soil resulted in a decrease in the coefficient of permeability (k), while UMO has a significant result of up to 4%. Regarding the control sample, spectrum analysis through FTIR effectively supports the laboratory results as the intensity of peaks increases with the oil, and bitumen concentration reveals that oil and bitumen impart cementitious property to the soil. Moreover, this research work by experiment supported and strengthened the idea of soil pavement stabilization through bitumen, which gives antiwater stability, and facilitates low-cost construction by obtaining raw material on the spot. UMO adversely affects soil properties beyond 4% addition by weight.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS) is a rare malignant disease and demonstrates various patterns in preoperative imaging. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is important. Given its unique form, we report a case of LG-ESS with a nodule-in-nodule appearance on preoperative imaging. A 41-year-old woman was referred to our department for further examination of a 45 mm diameter uterine corpus mass. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed several small nodules within a larger nodule. T2-weighted images showed moderate-to-high signal intensity with focal bands of low signal intensity in the small nodules. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathological findings of the small nodules showed densely concentrated endometrial stromal cells reminiscent of a proliferative phase endometrium with a concentric arrangement of small spiral arteriole-like vessels. The small nodules exhibited an expansile growth pattern and were surrounded by less densely concentrated endometrial stromal cells intermingled with the normal uterine myometrium. LG-ESS with smooth muscle differentiation and sex cord-like elements was partially observed. In summary, LG-ESS demonstrating a unique nodule-in-nodule appearance on preoperative imaging histopathologically comprised tumor cells of varying densities. Our current case suggests that preoperative diagnostic imaging with MRI may be useful.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a highly prevalent symptom, which afflicts vast majority of patients who suffer from cancer. The current treatment options failed to achieve satisfactory effect and the side effects were prominent. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of animal demonstrate the benefit of acupuncture for CIBP. We sought to determine if the pooled data from available RCTs supports the use of acupuncture for CIBP. Methods. A literature search for randomized controlled trials was conducted in six electronic databases from inception to May 31, 2019. Meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software; the publication bias was assessed by Stata 12.0 software. We used random effects model for pooling data because heterogeneity is absolute among studies to some extent. Results. Twenty-four trials were included in the review, of which 12 trials provided detailed data for meta-analyses. Preliminary evidence indicates that compared to wait list/sham group, acupuncture was effective on increasing paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL). Compared to medicine, acupuncture was less effective on PWT, but as effective as medicine on PWL. Acupuncture can reinforce medicine’s effect on PWT and PWL. Compared to the control group, acupuncture was superior to increase body weight (BW), decrease spinal cord glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Furthermore, some studies showed acupuncture delay or partially reverse morphine tolerance. Three studies found acupuncture has no effect on PWT, but 2 of them found acupuncture could enhance small dose of Celebrex’s effect on CIBP. Conclusions. Acupuncture was superior to wait list/sham acupuncture on increasing PWT and has no less effect on increasing PWL compared to medicine; acupuncture improved the efficacy of drugs, increased the CIBP animals’ body weight, and decreased their spinal cord GFAP and IL-1β. High-quality studies are necessary to confirm the results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. Due to economic consideration, Indonesia’s formulary restrictions are at odds with the treatment guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8). ADA and JNC 8 equally recommend the prescription of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with overt proteinuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine). However, since 1 April 2018, Indonesian formulary restricted telmisartan and valsartan only for T2DM patients with declined renal function as shown by eGFR value. There is no compelling evidence in favor of ACEI over ARB or vice versa except for data supporting the early use of both drugs in patients with overt proteinuria. However, ARB is a choice if ACEI’s side effects, that is, coughing, occurs. Therefore, it necessitates a detailed evaluation of the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on albuminuria and their side effect, hyperkalemia, specific to Indonesian T2DM patients. Methods. This cross-sectional study involved 134 T2DM patients whose treatment was restricted to either ACEIs (n = 57) or ARBs (n = 77) for at least two months before the study during May–October 2018. Patients with known end-stage renal disease and those receiving dialysis were excluded. UACR and blood potassium levels were compared between the two study groups. Also, the risk factors of albuminuria and hyperkalemia were estimated using multivariate analysis. Results. T2DM patients in the ACEI and ARB groups had similar characteristics except for a higher body mass index (p=0.008), lower glomerular filtration rate (p=0.04), and a longer duration of prior treatment (p&lt;0.001) in the ARB group. This study showed no differences between the ACEI and ARB groups in the proportion of cases with albuminuria (p=0.97) and hyperkalemia (p=0.86), even after adjustment for confounders. In addition, uncontrolled diastolic blood pressure was a significant factor associated with albuminuria (OR: 4.897, 95% CI: 1.026–23.366; p=0.046), whereas a female was 70.1% less likely to develop hyperkalemia than a male (OR: 0.299, 95% CI: 0.102–0.877; p=0.028). Conclusion. This cross-sectional study demonstrated that ACEIs and ARBs have a similar effect on albuminuria and hyperkalemia in Indonesian hypertensive T2DM patients, even after correction for potentially confounding variables.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The workup and surveillance strategies for infant hydronephrosis (HN) vary, although this could be due to grade-dependent differences in imaging intensity. We aimed to describe the frequency of imaging studies for HN within the first year of life, stratified by initial HN grade, within a large regional healthcare system. Study Design and Data Source. Retrospective cohort using Intermountain Healthcare Data Warehouse. Inclusion criteria: (1) birth between 1/1/2005 and 12/31/2013, (2) CPT code for HN, and (3) ultrasound (U/S) confirmed HN within four months of birth. Data Collection. Grade of HN on initial postnatal U/S; number of HN-associated radiologic studies (renal U/Ss, voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs), and diuretic renal scans); demographic and medical variables. Primary Outcome. Sum of radiologic studies within the first year of life or prior to pyeloplasty. Statistical Analysis. Multivariate poisson regression to analyze association between the primary outcome and the initial HN grade. Results. Of 1,380 subjects (993 males and 387 females), 990 (72%), 230 (17%), and 160 (12%) had mild, moderate, and severe HN, respectively. Compared with those with mild HN, patients with moderate (RR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.42–1.73) and severe (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.88–2.32) HN had a significantly higher rate of imaging use over 12 months (or prior to surgery) after controlling for potential confounders. Conclusions. In a large regional healthcare system, imaging use for HN is proportional to its initial grade. This suggests that within our system, clinicians treating this condition are using a risk-stratified approach to imaging.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study aims at exploring the clinical efficacy and sonographic changes of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using Hematoporphyrin Monomethyl Ether (HMME) for the treatment of port-wine stains (PWS). Forty-five patients with PWS were recruited between March 2017 and June 2018 from the Department of Dermatology of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Five cases were of the pink type, thirty-nine cases were of the purple-red type, and one case was of the thickened type. All patients received three treatment sessions of PDT. After covering normal skin outside the treated area, patients received an intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg HMME within 20 minutes. The affected areas were exposed to a 532 nm LED light and were kept vertically at a distance of 10 cm. The irradiation energy density was set between 80 and 110 J/cm2 in 15-minute sessions. Intermittent power density adjustment was performed at a rate of 5 mW/cm2, and the treatment was withheld when the endpoint reaction appeared. Three follow-ups were performed before and after treatment, respectively, and the efficacy, thickness, and density of skin before and after treatment were evaluated with high-frequency ultrasound. The overall efficacy rate was 97.78% in forty-five cases after treatment for three sessions. Efficacy was related to age (P=0.029) and lesion severity (P&lt;0.001). There were significant differences in the efficacy between the groups of &lt;18 years old, 18-29 years old, and &gt;29 years old (P=0.029). A marked decrease in the numbers of distorted enlarged blood vessels per unit of the lesion was observed under high-frequency ultrasound. There were significant differences in skin thickness and skin density before and after treatment (F=14.528, 5.428, P&lt;0.001). The swelling was reported to varying degrees in the treated areas in 23 patients with cheek lesion and in 6 frontal lesions. Hyperpigmentation after inflammation was observed in four patients that faded spontaneously after two months. In conclusion, photodynamic therapy for the treatment of PWS using HMME is effective and safe with few adverse reactions. Moreover, monitoring the changes in skin thickness and density of lesion tissue using high-frequency ultrasound can objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of HMME photodynamic therapy and provide the basis for the formulation of individualized photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Cubonavicular coalitions represent a relatively rare condition with less than forty cases described in the literature, the majority of which are fibrocartilaginous. To our knowledge, cubonavicular osseous coalition associated with osteoarthritis of the midfoot has never been described. Case Presentation. We present the case of a 26-year-old man with bilateral Achilles tendinosis, in whom radiological studies show an incidental finding of a complete osseous cubonavicular coalition, as well as a partial osseous cubo-third cuneiform coalition and a fibrous band between the first and second cuneiforms of the right foot, associated with arthritic changes of the tarsometatarsal joint. A nonosseous calcaneocubonavicular coalition was found on the left foot. These multiples coalitions were asymptomatic in this case. Discussion. Cubonavicular coalition, even asymptomatic, can cause midfoot osteoarthritis in young patients. We may therefore suspect that the immobility of the cubonavicular joint causes additional stress on the midfoot.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To explore the feasibility of evaluating the effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture versus sham electroacupuncture for patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Method. A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted at a teaching hospital in Beijing. A total of 30 patients with KOA (Kellgren grade II or III) were randomly allocated to an eight-week treatment of either electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders achieving at least 1.14 seconds decrease in the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) at week eight compared with baseline. The secondary outcomes included the knee range of motion, the knee extensor and flexor muscle strength, Lequesne index, 9-step stair-climb test (9-SCT), and TUG. Results. Of 30 patients allocated to two groups, 27 (90%) completed the study. The proportion of responders was 53.3% (8 of 15) for electroacupuncture group and 26.7% (4 of 15) for sham electroacupuncture group by the intention-to-treat analysis (P=0.264). There was no statistically significant difference in TUG between the two groups at eight weeks (P=0.856). The compliance rate measured according to patients who conformed to the protocol and had received treatments ≥20 times was 93.3% (28 of 30). The dropout rate was 20% (3 of 15). Adverse effects were not reported in the study. Conclusion. Our research demonstrated that further evaluation of the effectiveness of electroacupuncture versus sham electroacupuncture was feasible and safe for patients with KOA. Whether or not the electroacupuncture can improve the physical functions of knee joint, expand the knee range of motion, and increase the extensor and flexor muscle strength more significantly than sham electroacupuncture, future studies can be designed with larger sample size, randomization design and less biases. This trial is registered with NCT03366363.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. The standardized residency training (SRT) program in China is an important link for continuing education and clinical work training for graduate students. The purpose of our study was to enable educators to maintain the effectiveness of hysteroscopy teaching techniques and make the standardized residency training students well experienced in surgery, thus demonstrating that higher efficiency of teaching can lead to better proficiency for surgery. Methods. We generated resident-as-teacher teaching round and tutor guided hysteroscopic surgery as well as a questionnaire based on the mastery degree of the basic theoretical knowledge and operational skills of hysteroscopy among seven junior residents and five senior residents of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, including four attending gynecologic surgeons of a hysteroscopy teaching program. Results. Senior residents felt confident to teach, while junior residents learned effectively through the teaching round. There were statistically significant differences in the whole operation time and the volume of distension fluid used between junior and senior residents (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions. This study acknowledges the need for new approaches to medical education for better characterization of the link between the use of teaching rounds through problem-based learning (PBL) discussion dominated by the residents themselves and overall surgical skills of teaching and learning.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Tai Chi and Qigong are the two similar traditional Chinese wellness exercises. A strong body of published clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has investigated the health benefits of Tai Chi and Qigong exercises (TCQE) in patients with essential hypertension (EH). This is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of TCQE on blood pressure (BP) and blood levels of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in EH patients and explore the potential antihypertensive mechanism of TCQE. Methods. We conducted a literature retrieval for Chinese and English studies in seven databases from their respective inceptions until January 14, 2020. All RCTs examining clinical efficacy of TCQE for EH patients were considered. The major therapeutic outcomes of TCQE were changes in the blood levels of NO, ET-1, and BP in EH patients. Methodological quality of the included RCTs was detected via The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We evaluated the data reported and performed the meta-analysis by Review Manager 5.3 software. Results. 9 RCTs involving 516 EH patients were included. The intervention duration lasted from 1.5 months to 6 months. The results of comprehensive analysis showed that compared with control interventions, experimental interventions were more effective in reducing the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure and contributed higher blood levels of NO and lower blood levels of ET-1. Conclusions. TCQE could be an effective complementary and alternative therapy for EH. The lower BP in EH patients who practice TCQE may have some connection with exercise-related increased blood NO levels and decreased blood ET-1 levels. However, further research is needed to make clear the efficacy of TCQE in management of EH and the mechanism of lowering BP in TCQE.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The purpose of this study was to confirm the presence of specific patterns of epithelial response in corneal buttons from keratoconus patients. Methods. This was a retrospective and descriptive study. 90 penetrating keratoplasty specimens obtained from patients diagnosed with keratoconus were evaluated using bright-field microscopy. Morphologically identifiable characteristics including epithelial cell density and epithelial thickness were analyzed on hematoxylin and eosin- (H&amp;E-) and periodic acid of Schiff- (PAS-) stained slides. Results. Three distinctive patterns of epithelial alteration of the central cornea were established. Pattern 3, in which the central epithelium was as thick as peripheral epithelium, was the commonest (44.4%), followed by the pattern 2, defined as central epithelium thinner than periphery epithelium (38.9%), and the uncommonest pattern was number 1, with central epithelium thicker than the periphery (16.7%). Conclusions. Three distinctive histologic patterns that could potentially have a diagnostic and prognostic value in keratoconus patients were found.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by deterioration of bone tissue and mass, with an increasing global prevalence. Therefore, the discovery of biomarkers for osteoporosis would help to guide appropriate treatment. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have become increasingly recognized as biomarkers for detecting diseases. However, few studies have investigated the association of circulating miRNA with osteoporosis in the general population. The aim of this study was to identify miRNA associated with osteoporosis in a general resident health check-up for potential use as an osteoporosis biomarker. We conducted a cross-sectional study as part of a health check-up program and recruited 352 volunteers (139 men, 213 women, mean age 64.1±9.6 years). Osteoporosis was diagnosed according to the WHO classification. Twenty-two candidate microRNAs were screened through real-time quantitative PCR, and miRNAs associated with osteoporosis were analyzed using logistic regression analysis including other risk factors. In total, 95 females and 30 males were diagnosed with osteoporosis with bone mineral density tests (BMD: T‐score&lt;−2.5). We found that miR195 was significantly lower in females, while miR150 and miR222 were significantly higher in males. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that in females, higher age and lower miR195 (odds ratio: 0.45, 95% confidential interval: 0.03–0.98) were significant risk factors for lower BMD, while the presence of a smoking habit and lower miR150 (odds ratio: 1.35, 95% confidential interval: 1.02–1.79) were significant risk factors for osteoporosis. Serum levels of miR195 and miR150 are independently associated with low bone mineral density in females and males, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Affected by the mining activities of the working face, the surrounding rock of the roadway is easily deformed and destroyed. For deep buried roadways, the deformation and destruction of the surrounding rock is particularly prominent. Under the influence of in situ stress fluctuation, 3−1103 tailgate of the Hongqinghe coal mine was in a complex stress environment with a maximum stress exceeding 20 MPa. Affected by mining stress, the roadway behind the working face was seriously deformed. In order to alleviate the deformation of the roadway, directional blasting and cutting measures for the 3−1103 tailgate were adopted in this paper. The mechanism of crack propagation in single-row to three-hole directional blasting was revealed by numerical simulation. The blasted rock was divided into three regions according to the crack condition. The numerical analysis of the cutting heights of 0 m, 10 m, 12 m, and 14 m, respectively, showed the stress peaks of different cutting heights and the deformation law of the surrounding rock. The pressure relief effect was the best at 14 m cutting height. At this time, the peak stress was 39 MPa with the smallest roadway deformation. Based on numerical simulation and theoretical analysis results, engineering tests were carried out. Field monitoring showed that the deformation of the roadway was inversely proportional to the roof cutting height. The higher the cutting height is, the more preferential the roadway is to reach the stable state. It can be concluded that directional blasting can change the surrounding rock structure, control the deformation of the roadway, and play a role in pressure relief. It provides a new measure to control roadway deformation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A new series of mixed ligand complexes of Cd(II) and Mo(V) were successfully synthesized by refluxing the mixture solution of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC.HCl) with an aqueous and alcoholic solution of metal (M = Cd(II) and Mo(V)) salts and an alcoholic solution of salicylaldehyde (Sal). The complexes were characterized by modern analytical and spectral methods such as elemental microanalysis, pH, conductivity, surface tension, viscosity, melting point, and spectral methods such as FT-IR, NMR, electronic absorption, SEM, and mass spectrometry. Conductivity measurements of the complexes revealed their electrolytic nature. The kinetic and thermal stabilities were investigated using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis techniques. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters such as E∗, ΔH∗, ΔS∗, and ΔG∗ were calculated from TG curves using the Coats–Redfern method. Geometry optimization of the proposed structure of the complexes was achieved by running MM2 calculations in a Gaussian-supported CS ChemOffice 3D Pro.12.0 version software. The final optimized geometrical energies for respective Cd-OTC/Sal and Mo-OTC/Sal complexes were found to be 923.1740 and 899.3184 kcal/mol. The electronic absorption spectral study revealed a tetrahedral geometry for the Cd-OTC/Sal complex and octahedral geometry for the Mo-OTC/Sal complex. The antibacterial sensitivity of the complexes was evaluated against three bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis using the modified Kirby–Bauer paper disc diffusion method. The antibacterial study revealed significant growth inhibitory action of the complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pathological condition, affecting an increasing number of pregnant women worldwide. Safe and effective treatment for GDM is very important for the public health. In this study, we utilized a high-fat diet-induced GDM model to evaluate the effects of LBP on GDM and examined the changes of exosomal microRNA expression profiling to decipher the potential underlying mechanism of LBP. Methods. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet, HFD, or 150 mg/kg LBP-supplemented HFD for 6 weeks before conception and throughout gestation. Oral glucose tolerance test and plasma lipid levels were determined, and liver histopathology was assessed. Sequencing was used to define the microRNA expression profiling of plasma exosomes in the three groups of mice, and protein expression levels of the candidate target genes were analyzed. Results. LBP significantly relieved glucose intolerance, abnormal plasma lipid levels, and pathomorphological changes of liver histopathology in HFD-induced GDM mice. Moreover, we found that this effect of LBP was mediated by downregulation of the increase of 6 miRNAs (miR-93-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-466k, miR-1188-5p, miR-7001-3p, and miR-7115-5p) and reversing the increase of the protein expression of CPT1A, which is the target gene of miR-188-5p. Conclusions. Our findings provide novel insights into the biological activities of LBP in the treatment of GDM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (TC-PDA), conventionally guided by aortography, has become the standard treatment of this disease. The purposes of this study were to evaluate whether intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) may be used for measuring PDA size and be used as a guide for TC-PDA. Methods. This study had 2 phases. In phase 1, we compared the measurements of PDA size: pulmonary artery side diameter (PA-D), length, and aortic side diameter (Ao-D) of PDA, as measured by ICE with those measured by aortography or cardiac computed tomography (AoG/CCT) in 23 patients who underwent TC-PDA. In phase 2, we compared the demographics, fluoroscopic time, contrast volume, and complications of the TC-PDAs between 10 adult patients with ICE guidance and 16 without it. Results. In phase 1, we found great correlation and agreement between ICE and AoG/CCT in PA-D (r = 0.985, bias −0.077 to 0.224), but moderate to poor correlation and agreement in length (r = 0.653, bias −0.491 to 3.065) and Ao-D (r = 0.704, bias 0.738 to 4.732), respectively. Nevertheless, all patients underwent successful TC-PDA with ICE guidance that allowed us to continuously monitor the whole process. In phase 2, TC-PDA required a significantly lower contrast volume with ICE guidance than without it, and there was no significant difference in the remaining variables between the 2 groups. Conclusion. ICE is comparable to AoG/CCT in providing accurate PA-D of the PDA and may be a safe alternative to guide TC-PDA as compared to conventional aortography.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Intraoperative fluid (IOF) administration plays an important role during major abdominal surgery although increased fluid intake can adversely influence postoperative outcomes. However, the effect of the IOF rate on the outcomes of pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is unclear. Methods. 151 patients, who underwent PD at Binzhou Medical University Hospital between January 2010 and May 2017, were categorized into three groups according to IOF rates (ml/kg/hr): restricted (&lt;10, n=47), standard (10–15, n=76), and liberal (&gt;15, n=28). Results. The overall postoperative morbidity was 56.95%. The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) was 11.26%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 7.28% with the most common cause being grade C POPF and secondary intra-abdominal infections. The patients in the liberal group had significantly higher incidences of POPF (25%) and respiratory complications (21.43%). The other outcome parameters such as recovery of bowel function, hospital stay, and postoperative daily drainage were similar among the groups. Multivariable analysis confirmed the IOF rate to be most strongly associated with POPF (odds ratio: 5.195, confidence interval: 1.142–23.823, P=0.023) and respiratory complications (odds ratio: 7.302, confidence interval: 0.676–58.231, P=0.025). Conclusions. The IOF rate significantly affects the incidence of POPF and respiratory complications after PD. Careful patient-oriented fluid therapy may help to prevent these complications.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ashis Kumar Das</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Saji Saraswathy Gopalan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a threat to global health. Though current evidence on the epidemiology of the disease is emerging, very little is known about the predictors of recovery. Objectives. To describe the epidemiology of confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Republic of Korea and identify predictors of recovery. Materials and Methods. Using publicly available data for confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 20, 2020, to April 30, 2020, we undertook descriptive analyses of cases stratified by sex, age group, place of exposure, date of confirmation, and province. Correlation was tested among all predictors (sex, age group, place of exposure, and province) with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Associations between recovery from COVID-19 and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results. Majority of the confirmed cases were females (56%), 20-29 age group (24.3%), and primarily from three provinces—Gyeongsangbuk-do (36.9%), Gyeonggi-do (20.5%), and Seoul (17.1%). The case fatality ratio was 2.1%, and 41.6% cases recovered. Older patients, patients from provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Jeju-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Jeollanam-do, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery. Conclusions. Our study adds to the very limited evidence base on potential predictors of recovery among confirmed COVID-19 cases. We call additional research to explore the predictors of recovery and support development of policies to protect the vulnerable patient groups.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Industry 4.0 revolution is insisting strongly for use of machine learning-based processes and condition monitoring. In this paper, emphasis is given on machine learning-based approach for condition monitoring of shaft misalignment. This work highlights combined approach of artificial neural network and support vector machine for identification and measure of shaft misalignment. The measure of misalignment requires more features to be extracted under variable load conditions. Hence, primary objective is to measure misalignment with a minimum number of extracted features. This is achieved through normalization of vibration signal. An experimental setup is prepared to collect the required vibration signals. The normalized time domain nonstationary signals are given to discrete wavelet transform for features extraction. The extracted features such as detailed coefficient is considered for feature selection viz. Skewness, Kurtosis, Max, Min, Root mean square, and Entropy. The ReliefF algorithm is used to decide best feature on rank basis. The ratio of maximum energy to Shannon entropy is used in wavelet selection. The best feature is used to train machine learning algorithm. The rank-based feature selection has improved classification accuracy of support vector machine. The result obtained with the combined approach are discussed for different misalignment conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Currently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Hubei province, China. In this paper, stochastic and deterministic models are proposed to investigate the transmission mechanism of 2019-nCoV from 15 January to 5 February 2020 in Hubei province. For the deterministic model, basic reproduction number R0 is defined and endemic equilibrium is given. Under R0&gt;1, quasi-stationary distribution of the stochastic process is approximated by Gaussian diffusion. Residual, sensitivity, dynamical, and diffusion analyses of the models are conducted. Further, control variables are introduced to the deterministic model and optimal strategies are provided. Based on empirical results, we suggest that the first and most important thing is to control input, screening, treatment, and isolation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) has become a common postoperative syndrome that requires systematic and comprehensive therapy to achieve adequate clinical control. Acupuncture and related therapies have shown clinical effects for PCS in many studies. However, systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) for them are lacking. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of PCS using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods. Potentially eligible studies were searched in the following electronic databases up to 1 February 2020: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WoS), Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Database (WF), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP)), and other sources (WHO ICTRP, ChiCTR, Clinical Trials, and Grey Literature Database). The RevMan 5.3 was employed for analyses. The Cochrane Collaboration’ risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias (ROB). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results. A total of 14 RCTs with 1593 participants were included in this SR. MA showed that acupuncture in combination with conventional medicine (CM) did not show statistical differences in reduction in pain. However, acupuncture in combination with CM significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55–0.92) and improved gastrointestinal function recovery compared to the CM group. Acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine and CM, and acupuncture as monotherapy may improve gastrointestinal function recovery with acceptable adverse events. Conclusion. Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment for PCS. However, this study lacks conclusive evidence due to poor quality evidence, limited data, and clinical heterogeneity of acupuncture methods in the included studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Schisandra chinensis (SC) is reported to improve myocardial ischemia. Velocity vector imaging (VVI) is a noninvasive technique for evaluating myocardial function in humans, while few reported on the application in animals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the improved effects of SC on the myocardium of Sprague Dawley rats having hyperthyroid heart disease (HHD) using VVI technique. HHD models were established by injecting daily with subcutaneous levothyroxine (0.5 mg/kg). Then, the SC group was administered the aqueous extract of SC (2 g/kg) once daily, while the HHD and control (CON) groups were administered the same amount of distilled water daily. All the rats were provided the same amount of food and water daily, and the intervention was stopped after 28 days. The efficacy of SC in HHD rats was evaluated by ultrasound VVI. The serum total triiodothyronine level, total thyroxine level, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide expression, p53 expression, and calmodulin (CaM) activity were assessed by western blotting, Hematoxylin-Eosin and Masson staining, and electron microscopy. The results indicated that SC significantly improved the systolic velocity, diastolic velocity, strain, systolic strain rate, and diastolic strain rate of the heart by significantly reducing p53 expression and CaM activity (P&lt;0.05), improving myocardial fibrosis in HHD rats. Also, VVI can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of myocardial function in HHD rats.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The acoustic environment of urban residential areas is closely related to road traffic noise. More specifically, the effect of the light rail on the old residential area in Chongqing is potentially profound. Using geographic information system (GIS) to construct a map of the urban light rail’s influence on the acoustic environment of residential areas, the influence of noise can be determined. Very few studies exist on the impact of light rails on the acoustic environment of residential areas, and there is no literature on the impact of light rails on the acoustic environment of residential areas using GIS. In this study, the degree of influence of a light rail on nearby residential areas and the diffusion degree of light rail noise in these areas during various times of the day were analysed by measuring the objective indicators of acoustic landscape elements and evaluating subjective indicators. The layout mode of the residential areas and the light rail were superimposed, and other traffic noise influences were eliminated. This method provides a scientific basis for the planning, design, and reconstruction of residential areas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To quantitatively identify the transfer paths and evaluate path contributions of shell structures, an singular value decomposition- (SVD-) and principal component analysis- (PCA-) based operational transfer path analysis method is constructed and studied in this paper. Firstly, SVD is used to determine the contribution of each path and reduce crosstalk. Secondly, PCA is applied to reduce the influence of unwanted frequency components and thus reduce noises. This allows the presented OTPA to be more accurate than its traditional counterpart. Once the transmissibility function is obtained, the response synthesis is determined, and the transfer path analysis and path contribution evaluation can be effectively carried out. Numerical and experimental case studies are carried out to validate and test the performance of the presented method. Furthermore, a comprehensive observing the influences of correlation between sources and distance of sources and receiver is also provided. Generally, this paper provides accurate transfer path analysis and path contributions for mechanical systems, which can benefit vibration and noise monitoring and reduction through vibration reduction structure design for new equipment or vibration damping on the major vibration transfer paths for current equipment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to present an observer-based control design with application to continuous bioreactors. For this purpose, phenomenological bioreactor models were represented by identified linear models plus unknown modelling error terms. Therefore, an uncertainty-based observer with a polynomial structure capable of estimating the unknown modelling error of the reactor representation is coupled to a linear input-output controller. The proposed methodology was evaluated in a sulphate reduction bioprocess and an acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process for butanol (biofuel) production, under continuous regimes. Experimentally validated mathematical models were considered for this purpose. A theoretical framework is presented to demonstrate the corresponding closed-loop stability of the systems, and numerical simulations were carried out to corroborate the satisfactory performance of the proposed methodology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the acceleration of urbanization, there are increasingly more high-rise buildings in cities. In turn, high-rise building collapse accidents occur frequently. The causes of the danger, in addition to the extremely severe stress, are predominantly due to the long-term role of unstable factors, resulting in an unrecoverable internal structure. Therefore, it is advisable to monitor the dynamic deformation of buildings to prevent accidents. However, there is no particularly mature application system on the market to enable this monitoring, so our research group has carried out a long-term research in this field. This paper introduces the design of a set of practical information systems by using information technology and the principle of close-range photogrammetry. The system used the photographing scale transformation-time baseline parallax (PST-TBP) method to analyse image data collected with a digital camera, implement close-range photogrammetry, and input the image data into a computer. A building deformation diagram is obtained using our own software. The associated deformation curve can clearly reproduce the building deformation trend to monitor the building health. We conducted many laboratory simulation experiments to verify the information system, and the verification results prove that this process is rigorous. To apply this information system to a real-life scenario as soon as possible, we further studied its application to high-rise buildings, improved the system by using data and experience obtained by monitoring the tallest local building, and achieved good results. Finally, combined with the development of current intelligent technology, directions for system improvement are explored.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Solar energy has become a viable alternative energy because it is a clean type of energy that converts solar radiation into heat energy for various applications such as heating water, power generation, cooking, and food drying. The solar dryer, integrated with the heat energy storage system, uses nitrate salt as a heat storage medium which was designed and tested by drying 1000 grams of red pepper at 19.6 to 62.4°C. The average ambient temperature ranged from 19.3 to 37.4°C, and the maximum temperature of the heat storage media ranged from 87.8 to 125°C. The solar drying process was compared to open sun drying system loaded with 1000 grams of red pepper. The findings showed that the solar dryer maintained color and flavor and lowered the original moisture content from 86% to 10% for 24 hours compared to 36 hours of drying in open air. In this study, nitrate salt is shown to be the perfect heat storage medium for drying food products; it preserved heat for about 4 hours when there is no active sunlight.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Modern family planning methods are widely believed to influence fertility reduction worldwide. Family planning had a clear effect on the health of women, children, and families worldwide especially those in developing countries. It has been shown that there are many instances in which women might discontinue contraception methods that put women’s health at risk. Objectives. To assess and identify Determinants of Modern Contraceptive Methods Discontinuation among Women in Reproductive age interval in Dire Dawa City. Method. A cross-sectional study design was employed. A total of 811 respondent women with one-year history of modern contraceptive method usage were considered in the study. A stratified random sampling method was used to select the study participants. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed by descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Result. The study indicated that 634 (78.20%) of respondent mothers continued using the method that they have used before a year. Whereas 177 (21.80%) of women discontinued using the method within a year. The factors age, number of children, who made the decision on the choice of the method used, the type of contraceptive method used, and taking counseling before using the method were found significant at 5% level of significance. Conclusion. Young women, respondents who have no or a small number of children, and not the decision maker on the choice of the method were more likely to discontinue. Whereas women who did not take counseling are less likely to discontinue. When compared to women who used implant those women who used pills and injectables are more likely to discontinue. Thus, the study identified factors that contribute to the discontinuation of modern contraception methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb has been known as an ethnopharmacological medicinal plant for antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. Although various pharmacological studies of C. orbiculatus extract has been reported, an anti-inflammatory mechanism study of their phytochemical constituents has not been fully elucidated. In this study, compounds 1–17, including undescribed podocarpane-type trinorditerpenoid (3), were purified from C. orbiculatus and their chemical structure were determined by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass (HRESIMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data. To investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 1–17, nitric oxide (NO) secretion was evaluated in LPS-treated murine macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. Among compounds 1–17, deoxynimbidiol (1) and new trinorditerpenoid (3) showed the most potent inhibitory effects (IC50: 4.9 and 12.6 μM, respectively) on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated NO releases as well as proinflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2, interleukin- (IL-) 1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α. Its inhibitory activity of proinflammatory mediators is contributed by suppressing the activation of nuclear transcription factor- (NF-) κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades including p65, inhibition of NF-κB (IκB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. Therefore, these results demonstrated that diterpenoids 1 and 3 obtained from C. orbiculatus may be considered a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Proper determination of the shear strength of the backfill body used to fill the subsidence is the basis for subsidence restoration and the stability analysis of materials. This study developed a shear strength calculation model for the backfill body by introducing adhesive friction theory into the shear strength analysis. A direct shear test was performed in the laboratory to verify the proposed method. Test results suggested that the shear strength calculation method based on adhesive friction theory can calculate the variation in the actual contact area between grains in the tested samples undergoing shearing and estimate the peak shear strength. The actual contact area was divided into two components, namely, adhesive contact area Arm and contact area reduction caused by shear displacement, which exhibited a maximum at Armax. The shear strength values calculated by this method were smaller than laboratory values, and their differences increased with the rock proportion in the backfill body. The differences between the theoretical and experimental values of shear strength increased with the rock grain size. The results of theoretical calculation, combined with the results of laboratory experiments, can provide support for the proper determination of shear strength of the backfill body.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To evaluate methods for analysis of genotoxic effects on mammalian cell lines, we tested the effect of three common genotoxic agents on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Suspension-grown CHO cells were separately incubated with etoposide, bleomycin, and ethyl methanesulfonate and analyzed by an alkaline comet assay and GC-MS/MS. Although DNA strand breaks were detected by the comet assay after treatment with all three agents, GC-MS/MS could only detect DNA nucleobase lesions oxidatively induced by bleomycin. This demonstrates that although GC-MS/MS has limitations in detection of genotoxic effects, it can be used for selected chemical genotoxins that contribute to oxidizing processes. The comet assay, used in combination with GC-MS/MS, can be a more useful approach to screen a wide range of chemical genotoxins as well as to monitor other DNA-damaging factors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Using a surgically induced varicocele rat model, we show here strong evidence that the misfolded/unfolded protein response that is part of the stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is activated in the varicocele testis (VCL), leading to the induction of apoptosis. To support this hypothesis, it is observed that the spliced variant of the X-box protein 1 (XBP1s), resulting from the activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) membrane sensor, is significantly more represented in VCL testicular extracts. The activation of the IRE1/XBP1s pathway is also supported by the observation that the VCL testes show an increase phosphorylation of the c-Jun-kinase (JNK) known to be one intermediate of this pathway and an increased level of caspase-3, the terminal apoptotic effector, partly explaining the apoptotic status of the VCL testis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. This study aimed to clarify the effects of cesarean delivery on neonatal respiratory morbidity when women had preterm premature rupture of membranes. Methods. This retrospective study included women with preterm premature rupture of membranes who delivered from 23 weeks to 33 weeks of gestation between January 2009 and December 2014. Neonatal outcomes were compared between infants delivered by cesarean section and those delivered vaginally. The primary outcome was respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Neonatal intubation and mechanical ventilation periods were secondary outcomes. Propensity score matching was used to compare outcomes between cesarean and vaginal delivery cases. Results. There were 101 cesarean deliveries and 89 vaginal deliveries. A comparison of the presence or absence of neonatal complications based on the delivery type indicated a higher occurrence of RDS with cesarean deliveries (P=0.025). The intubation and mechanical ventilation periods were not significantly longer in neonates delivered via cesarean section. Conclusions. Cesarean delivery is a risk factor for neonatal RDS in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Trials identifying long-term neonatal prognoses are needed to further develop optimal management strategies in such cases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. To determine if cochlear duct length and cochlear basal diameter, measured using routinely available radiology software, affect hearing outcomes after cochlear implantation with two different length electrodes. Methods. 55 patients who received a Med-El Flex electrode were retrospectively reviewed. 34 patients received the Flex 31 electrode (31mm) and 21 patients received the Flex 28 electrode (28mm). Preoperative high-resolution CT scans of the temporal bone were reformatted in the axial and coronal plane. The basal diameter of the cochlear (A-value) and the outer-wall lengths of the cochlear duct were measured using readily available imaging software. Postoperative plane X-rays were used to determine the degree of electrode insertion and the number of electrodes within the cochlea and speech discrimination scores at 6 months were evaluated. Results. The cochlear metrics obtained were comparable with those previously published in the literature. There was no significant difference in the degree of insertion or speech outcomes between the two electrode lengths. However, when the group who had received the shorter electrode were analysed, there was an association seen between both cochlear duct length and cochlear diameter and speech outcomes. Conclusions. Cochlear size may be a factor in determining speech outcomes that cannot be explained solely by insertion depth or degrees of insertion. Further studies are required to determine if cochlear duct length is an independent predictor of speech outcomes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The professional Quality of Life Scale (QLS) can provide a valuable reference for the diagnosis of visual function anomalies. In the present study, we aimed to design a novel QLS to specially quantify the life quality of schoolchildren with nonstrabismic binocular vision anomalies (NSBVAs) in China. Methods. The novel QLS, named QOL-CVF20, was established based on classical vision-related scales and the administration of the questionnaire to 116 schoolchildren with NSBVAs and 100 healthy schoolchildren in China. The diagnostic reference value between QOL-CVF20 and VF-14 was evaluated on the questionnaires to 240 schoolchildren with NSBVAs and 238 healthy schoolchildren. Results. All the subjects could complete the QOL-CVF20 questionnaires independently. QOL-CVF20 had good structural validity, content validity, and discriminant validity, when it was applied in Chinese schoolchildren. The average score of the NSBVA group was significantly lower than that of the control group (49.0±6.9 vs. 69.7±6.7, respectively; P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the average score of cured NSBVA schoolchildren after treatment (61.8±22.6) was significantly improved (P&lt;0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that QOL-CVF20 reflected strong separation between the NSBVA and healthy groups (AUC=0.901). Meanwhile, QOL-CVF20 could detect individuals with NSBVAs with specificity of 0.847 and sensitivity of 0.846. The critical value of 58.50 in QOL-CVF20 could be effectively applied for quality of life assessment in schoolchildren with NSBVAs. Conclusions. QOL-CVF20 could quantify the life quality of schoolchildren with NSBVAs and might be served as a valuable reference for early diagnosis and clinical evaluation of NSBVAs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Potassium bromate (PB) is a food enhancer, water disinfection by-product, and a proven carcinogen. It elicits toxicities in the living organism due to exposure and in a dose-dependent manner. The present study discourses the ameliorative efficacy of riboflavin (RF) in PB-administered rodents. The animals were distributed into five treatment groups: control (group I), PB alone (group II, 150 mg/kg), RF alone (group III, 2 mg/kg), PB+RF1 (group IV, 150 mg/kg+2 mg/kg), and PB+RF2 (group V, 150 mg/kg+4 mg/kg). After the round of the treatment, the animals were sacrificed to collect their blood and liver samples for the detailed analysis. Group II depicted perturbed liver functions evidenced by altered serum and toxicity markers along with the disturbed redox balance. Also, these biochemical results were found harmonious with histopathological analysis and comet assay. However, group III showed no noticeable alteration in the same parameters, whereas the combination groups (IV and V) exhibited dose-dependent amelioration in the PB-induced toxicities. Interestingly, RF favored apoptosis concomitant with suppressing the necrosis in the PB-challenged groups, as shown by the activity of caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase. Histopathological analysis and comet assay further consolidate these results. Hence, RF has significant alleviative property against PB-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo that can be used in the consumer items containing the toxicant.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The aim of this work was to analyze clinical features and laboratory findings of children with adenovirus pneumonia and guide clinical diagnosis, treatment, and assessment of disease severity. Material and Methods. Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 285 children with adenoviral pneumonia who were hospitalized in Wuhan Children’s Hospital from December 2018 to October 2019. According to the assessment criteria for severe pneumonia, it was divided into the severe group (92 cases) and the nonsevere group (193 cases). Collected clinical manifestations, complications, and laboratory test indicators in two groups of children and conducted all statistical analyses. Results. The risk of fever and wheezing was significantly higher in the severe group than in the nonsevere group. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). The risk of complications in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). The levels of AST, LDH-L, PCT, ferritin, and D-dimer in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the nonsevere group. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion. Children with severe adenovirus pneumonia have severe clinical manifestations and many complications. AST, LDH-L, PCT, ferritin, and D-dimer levels have important clinical implications for assessing disease severity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A grain-based rock model was developed and applied to study mechanical characteristics and failure micromechanics in thick-walled cylinder and wellbore stability tests. The rock is represented as an assembly of tetrahedral blocks with bonded contacts. Material heterogeneity is modeled by varying the tensile strength at the block contacts. This grain-based rock model differs from previous disk/sphere particle-based rock models in its ability to represent a zero (or very low) initial porosity condition, as well as highly interlocked irregular block shapes that provide resistance to movement even after contact breakage. As a result, this model can reach higher uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength ratios and larger friction coefficients than the disk/sphere particle-based rock model. The model captured the rock fragmentation process near the wellbore due to buckling and spalling. Thin fragments of rock similar to onion skins were produced, as observed in laboratory breakout experiments. The results suggest that this approach may be well suited to study the rock disaggregation process and other geomechanical problems in the rock excavation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on the left bank slope of Baihetan hydropower station in Southwestern China, a high-precision microseismic monitoring system was established. An early warning model of surrounding rock mass deformation and failure based on MF-DFA was proposed. The results showed that the multifractal characteristics of the microseismic and blasting waveform time series in the left bank slope were obvious, and the multifractal spectrum width of the blasting waveform is much larger than that of microseismic waveform. Before the slope cracks increased, the multifractal time-varying response characteristics of microseismic waveform showed strong regularity, which could be regarded as a precursor of surrounding rock mass deformation. Before the deformation and failure of surrounding rock mass, the multifractal spectrum width Δα showed an increasing trend while the multifractal spectrum of microseismic waveforms Δf(α) presented a decreasing trend, which can be regarded as a precursor of surrounding rock mass deformation; when deformation and failure occurred, Δα showed a decreasing trend and Δf(α) showed an increasing trend, which can be regarded as a deformation failure period; after the occurrence of deformation and failure, both Δα and Δf(α) showed a steady trend, and Δf(α) would approach to the zero line, which can be regarded as a stable period.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) is a powerful metaheuristic for global optimization. This paper studies parallelizing CLPSO by open computing language (OpenCL) on the integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 (IHDG520) graphical processing unit (GPU) with a low clock rate. We implement a coarse-grained all-GPU model that maps each particle to a separate work item. Two enhancement strategies, namely, generating and transferring random numbers from the central processor to the GPU as well as reducing the number of instructions in the kernel, are proposed to shorten the model’s execution time. This paper further investigates parallelizing deterministic optimization for implicit stochastic optimization of China’s Xiaowan Reservoir. The deterministic optimization is performed on an ensemble of 62 years’ historical inflow records with monthly time steps, is solved by CLPSO, and is parallelized by a coarse-grained multipopulation model extended from the all-GPU model. The multipopulation model involves a large number of work items. Because of the capacity limit for a buffer transferring data from the central processor to the GPU and the size of the global memory region, the random number generation strategy is modified by generating a small number of random numbers that can be flexibly exploited by the large number of work items. Experiments conducted on various benchmark functions and the case study demonstrate that our proposed all-GPU and multipopulation parallelization models are appropriate; and the multipopulation model achieves the consumption of significantly less execution time than the corresponding sequential model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the new construction or reconstruction of expressway projects, the number of highway twin tunnels with eight lanes is increasing. However, there are no corresponding design support parameters and measures in the current technical specifications for tunnel design and construction in China. In Laohushan superlarge-span highway tunnel with single hole and four lanes, the deformation behavior and mechanical characteristics of support structures are measured and analyzed. The monitoring results indicated that the deformation of tunnel structure mainly experienced three stages: rapid deformation, slow deformation, and stable deformation, and finally reached a relatively stable state; the structure stress of primary support and secondary lining increases sharply at first and then tends to be stable gradually with the gradual construction of each excavation part in the tunnel; the stress of each measuring point at the steel rib is less than the yield limit of steel rib (235 MPa), and the support structure is safe and stable in the process of tunnel construction. Then, the structure safety of primary support under different support parameters is simulated and calculated by numerical simulation with Grade IV rock mass, and the reasonable support parameters for Laohushan highway tunnel are studied considering the structural safety and engineering economy. It is suggested to use the H175-type steel sets with a distance of 80 cm and C25 shotcrete with a thickness of 26 cm. The results could provide reference for similar tunnel projects and provide a basis for the design specification and construction standards for superlarge-span tunnels.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Quercus species, also known as oak, represent an important genus of the Fagaceae family. It is widely distributed in temperate forests of the northern hemisphere and tropical climatic areas. Many of its members have been used in traditional medicine to treat and prevent various human disorders such as asthma, hemorrhoid, diarrhea, gastric ulcers, and wound healing. The multiple biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, anticancer, gastroprotective, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities have been ascribed to the presence of bioactive compounds such as triterpenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. This paper aimed to provide available information on the medicinal uses, phytochemicals, and pharmacology of species from Quercus. However, further investigation is needed to fully clarify the mode of action of its bioactive compounds and to evaluate in vivo chronic toxicity, before exploring their potential use as a supplement in functional foods and natural pharmaceutics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we extend the entropy scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws to one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation. The operator splitting method is used to solve the convection-diffusion equation that is divided into conservation and diffusion parts, in which the first-order accurate entropy scheme is applied to solve the conservation part and the second accurate central difference scheme is applied to solve the diffusion part. Numerical tests show that the L∞ error achieves about second-order accuracy, but the L1 error reaches about forth-order accuracy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A 38-year-old hypertensive male with a smoking history presented to the emergency room with significant hemoptysis, arthritis, and a purpuric rash. Other findings included a dropping hemoglobin and acute kidney injury with microscopic hematuria. The pulmonary computed tomography was significant for alveolar hemorrhage and a rarely reported pneumomediastinum. Along with this constellation of findings, a positive antiproteinase 3 helped to confirm this patient’s diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Treatment commenced with sessions of plasma exchange and pulse steroids along with cyclophosphamide infusions. The patient had since improved and made a full recovery. This case report highlights the rarely described pneumomediastinum in association with vasculitides.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged virus that has spread rapidly, exhibiting tremendous morbidity and mortality. Some potential pharmaceutical targets have been identified but are still lacking proper validation. Case Presentation. We describe the case of a young, immunosuppressed and critically ill patient with previous Influenza B infection, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which was then followed, in the succeeding months, by SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. Her clinical course exhibited complications, including pulmonary embolism, acute kidney injury, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, multiple cardiac arrests, and eventually death. Conclusion. Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens and opportunistic infections are possible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A 42-year-old male patient presented with intermittent abdominal pain and gastrointestinal discomfort present for 4 years. Work-up included ultrasound and computed tomography, which identified a fat-containing splenic mass 5.6 cm in size. Due to recurrent symptoms, the patient sought medical care again. Subsequent images showed an increase in size to 7.6 cm, which was concerning for neoplasm. This was removed via open splenectomy, which was challenging due to intra-abdominal adhesions despite never having had any abdominal surgery. The patient’s recovery was uncomplicated. Pathologic assessment indicated that the mass was a myelolipoma. Extra-adrenal myelolipomas are rare and typically found within the retroperitoneum but are extremely rare within the spleen. This case report adds the 6th such case to the literature and demonstrates the need for it to remain in the differential diagnosis of patients with fatty splenic masses, as well as that splenectomy is an appropriate treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a long-term and chronic autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the pancreatic β-cells. Both adaptive and innate immune systems are involved in T1DM development. Both B-cells and T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as well as other T-cell subsets, could affect onset of autoimmunity. Furthermore, cells involved in innate immunity, including the macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, could also accelerate or decelerate T1DM development. In this review, the crosstalk and function of immune cells in the pathogenesis of T1DM, as well as the corresponding therapeutic interventions, are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Movement is altered by pain, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Assessing corrective muscle responses following mechanical perturbations can help clarify these underlying mechanisms, as these responses involve spinal (short-latency response, 20-50 ms), transcortical (long-latency response, 50-100 ms), and cortical (early voluntary response, 100-150 ms) mechanisms. Pairing mechanical (proprioceptive) perturbations with different conditions of visual feedback can also offer insight into how pain impacts on sensorimotor integration. The general aim of this study was to examine the impact of experimental tonic pain on corrective muscle responses evoked by mechanical and/or visual perturbations in healthy adults. Two sessions (Pain (induced with capsaicin) and No pain) were performed using a robotic exoskeleton combined with a 2D virtual environment. Participants were instructed to maintain their index in a target despite the application of perturbations under four conditions of sensory feedback: (1) proprioceptive only, (2) visuoproprioceptive congruent, (3) visuoproprioceptive incongruent, and (4) visual only. Perturbations were induced in either flexion or extension, with an amplitude of 2 or 3 Nm. Surface electromyography was recorded from Biceps and Triceps muscles. Results demonstrated no significant effect of the type of sensory feedback on corrective muscle responses, no matter whether pain was present or not. When looking at the effect of pain on corrective responses across muscles, a significant interaction was found, but for the early voluntary responses only. These results suggest that the effect of cutaneous tonic pain on motor control arises mainly at the cortical (rather than spinal) level and that proprioception dominates vision for responses to perturbations, even in the presence of pain. The observation of a muscle-specific modulation using a cutaneous pain model highlights the fact that the impacts of pain on the motor system are not only driven by the need to unload structures from which the nociceptive signal is arising.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hydration reactions of expansive materials are typically very safe, easy to induce, and low in cost, while the crushing of such materials is typically free from noise, dust, vibration, and toxic gases. In the present study, to realize the application of expansive materials in the prevention of coal seam gas disasters, the microstructure, heat release rate, and expansive pressure of expansive materials were investigated for different degrees of hydration based on temperature and pressure measurements and using a scanning electron microscope (SEM); fracture characteristics were determined based on fracture tests of coal-like materials. The results show that the expansive material with +30% water has the lowest hydration temperature (100°C). The expansive pressure of the steel tube was found to reach 57 MPa, which is deemed suitable for application in coal seams. The strain and displacement of coal-like materials were found to increase with time, with four main cracks appearing. Based on these results, it is feasible that hydration reactions of expansive materials could increase both gas drainage and permeability in coal seams, thus reducing the risk of rock burst around boreholes in coal seams.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aiming at the problem of surface movement and long-term stability of a work plane of deep well strip mining in Shandong Province, an observation station is set up on the surface of strip mining, and the surface deformation value during strip mining is measured with advanced measuring instruments; on the stable surface of the old mining area, the surface deformation monitoring work is also carried out for new buildings. In addition, the FLAC3D simulation method is used to determine the subsidence factor of different mining depth, mining width, mining length, and mining thickness, and the mathematical model between the subsidence factor and mining depth, mining width, mining length, and mining thickness is established. After the surface of the old goaf is basically stable after strip mining, the high-rise buildings are built. By changing the size of the new buildings and the amount of the load imposed on the surface, the surface deformation is simulated and calculated, and the relationship between the different load positions, load sizes, loading building sizes, and the surface activated deformation is obtained. The measured value of the surface deformation confirms that the load of the new buildings can induce the activation of the old goaf and make the surface generate secondary deformation, but the activated deformation makes the new building within the range of 1, so the new building is safe.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of the traditional Chinese medicine with the formula Da-Cheng-Qi-Tang (T-DCQT) and a modified Da-Cheng-Qi-Tang (M-DCQT) in a postoperative ileus (POI) mouse model. POI was induced via small bowel manipulation, and T-DCQT or M-DCQT was given by enema. The intestinal motility was measured with a charcoal mixture gavage. The intestinal tissues were collected for further studies by histopathological, qPCR, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in blood were determined using a high-throughput liquid chip. We found that gastrointestinal dysfunction was alleviated after administration of either a T-DCQT or M-DCQT enema. Increased expression of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and TLR4 in the intestinal tissues of POI mice were reversed following treatment. IL-1α, IL-6, MIP-1β, and IL-17 levels were significantly reduced at 24 h and 48 h following treatment, while the MCP-1 level was only observed to be reduced at 24 h after the treatment. Furthermore, compared with the T-DCQT effect, M-DCQT treatment was more effective in alleviating the increased IL-6, MIP-1β, and IL-1α levels. So, we draw a conclusion that T-DCQT or M-DCOT could ameliorate the POI-associated inflammatory response and improve GI motility in a POI mouse model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A compact hybrid-mode antenna is proposed for sub-6 GHz communication. The proposed antenna is composed of a slotted rectangular patch, a feeding dipole, and a balun. Three modes are sequentially excited in a shared patch to achieve a compact size. A prototype antenna with a major size of 0.48 λ0 × 0.31 λ0 × 0.16 λ0 (λ0 is the wavelength in the free space at the center of the operating frequency band) is fabricated and measured. The measured results demonstrate an impedance bandwidth of 56.87% from 2.97 GHz to 5.33 GHz and an average gain of approximately 8.00 dBi with 1 dB variation in the operating frequency band of 3.0–5.0 GHz. The proposed antenna can be an element for microbase stations in sub-6 GHz communication.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study aimed at detecting 13 organic acids (oxalic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, quinic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and butyric acid) by establishing a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis was performed using two sugar columns, i.e., SH1011 column and KC-811 column. The optimal conditions were as follows: 4 mmol/L HClO4 solution as the eluent with UV-visible detector (210 nm), a flow rate of 1 mL/min at the temperature of 60°C, and the injection volume at 10 μL. The results showed that all the calibration curves had excellent linearity (R2&gt;0.9991) within the test ranges. The RSD values of the thirteen analytes were lower than 2.94% at three levels, the recoveries were 91.9%-102.0%, the limit of detection (LOD) was between 0.05 and 10.63 μg/mL, and the quantification (LOQ) was between 0.10 and 19.53 μg/mL. Finally, the proposed methodology was successfully applied for the analysis of organic acids in the culture medium of edible fungi. In conclusion, the study findings proved that the method was sensitive, accurate, reproducible, and could be readily applied to analyze the organic acids in the samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sparse arrays, which can localize multiple sources with less physical sensors, have attracted more attention since they were proposed. However, for optimal performance of sparse arrays, it is usually assumed that the circumstances are ideal. But in practice, the performance of sparse arrays will suffer from the model errors like mutual coupling, gain and phase error, and sensor’s location error, which causes severe performance degradation or even failure of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms. In this study, we follow with interest and propose a covariance-based sparse representation method in the presence of gain and phase errors, where a generalized nested array is employed. The proposed strategy not only enhances the degrees of freedom (DOFs) to deal with more sources but also obtains more accurate DOA estimations despite gain and phase errors. The Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) derivation is analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the method. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from DOA estimation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Self-cleaning surfaces may have wide applications such as microfluidic devices, lab-on-a-chip, sensors, microreactors, air purification, and antimicrobial fields. In this article, by using a combination of femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation and fluorination technique, self-cleaning stainless steel surfaces with unique antifouling property were obtained. New insight is developed through a detailed analysis of the antifouling behavior of the self-cleaning surfaces. The surface free energy and its polar and disperse components were calculated by using the Owens–Wendt-–Rabel–Kaelble (OWRK) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to analyse the surface elemental compositions and functional groups. The antifouling property of the surface was recorded by using a high speed camera. Water sliding angles (SAs) were reduced by fluorination treatment, resulting in low adhesive superhydrophobic surfaces with the self-cleaning property. The influences of micro/nanostructures, fluorination, and their combination on the surface free energy were investigated. The interaction process between water droplets and pollutants (inorganic and organic particles) on the treated surface was explored. The antifouling property of an optimized specimen (CA = 162° and SA = 1°) was tested and compared with the untreated sample.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hong Tang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Field survey is a labour-intensive way to objectively evaluate the grade of building damage triggered by earthquakes. In this paper, we present a decision-tree-based approach to classify the type of building damage by using multiple-source remote sensing from both pre- and postearthquakes. Specifically, the boundary of buildings is delineated from preearthquake multiple-source satellite images using an unsupervised learning method. Then, building damage is classified into four types using decision tree method from postearthquake UAV images, that is, basically intact buildings, slightly damaged buildings, partially collapsed buildings, and completely collapsed buildings. Furthermore, the slightly damaged buildings are determined by the detected roof-holes using joint color and height features. Two experimental areas from Wenchuan and Ya’an earthquakes are used to verify the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interleukin-10 (IL10) is best studied for its inhibitory action on immune cells and ability to suppress an antitumour immune response. But IL10 also exerts direct effects on nonimmune cells such as prostate cancer epithelial cells. Elevated serum levels of IL10 observed in prostate and other cancer patients are associated with poor prognosis. After first-line androgen-deprivation therapy, prostate cancer patients are treated with androgen receptor antagonists such as enzalutamide to inhibit androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth. However, development of resistance inevitably occurs and this is associated with tumour differentiation to more aggressive forms such as a neuroendocrine phenotype characterized by expression of neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin. We found that treatment of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro with IL10 or enzalutamide induced markers of neuroendocrine differentiation and inhibited androgen receptor reporter activity. Both also upregulated the levels of PDL1, which could promote tumour survival in vivo through its interaction with the immune cell inhibitory receptor PD1 to suppress antitumour immunity. These findings suggest that IL10’s direct action on prostate cancer cells could contribute to prostate cancer progression independent of IL10’s suppression of host immune cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, the reliability of vertical vibration test method (VVTM) was evaluated by comparing the changes in moisture content and gradation before and after forming the test piece by VVTM and static pressure method and the mechanical strength correlation between the laboratory compaction sample and the core sample in the field. The effects of cement content, curing period, gradation, and compaction degree on the unconfined compressive strength, splitting strength, and compressive rebound modulus of VVTM-compacted cement-stabilized crushed gravel (CSCG) were studied, and a mechanical strength prediction equation for VVTM-compacted CSCG was formulated. The results show that the correlation between the strength of the VVTM specimen and the field core sample can reach 92%; the mechanical strength of CSCG will increase with increase in the cement content, and when the cement content reaches approximately 4%, the increase in its mechanical strength will slow down; the mechanical strength of VVTM-compacted CSCG with different cement dosages and gradation types increased fast at 14 days of curing period and began to level off after 90 days. Compared with XM gradation, using GM gradation can improve the mechanical strength. Under different gradations and curing periods, the mechanical strength linearly increases with increase in the degree of compaction. The mechanical strength prediction equation has a high reliability; therefore, it can accurately predict the strength growth rules. Moreover, the degree of compaction increases by 1%, and the mechanical strength increases by approximately 10%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There has been a long history for foundation treatment by quicklime pile, but as for establishing a more precise model formula used by actual construction, further research is needed to be done at present. Therefore, how to quantitate the factors affecting pile spacing is of great reference value for both actual constructions and theoretical studies. Based on the reference formula for handling weak foundation by lime pile and the practical problems in the western region, mathematical model analysis method is used to get a new model for high water content loess foundation treatment after considering the factors such as pile expanding, construction method, piles arrangement, and calcium oxide content. In this model, pile spacing coefficient is created and the model formula for different construction methods and different pile arrangements is also given. As a result, the reference formula used in high water content loess is somewhat conservative. The new model is also verified to be rational by the actual works at the end of the paper.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work aims to investigate the ability of using waste foundry sand (WFS) resulting as inexpensive by-product from steel industry in the low permeability barrier (LPB) and permeable reactive barrier (PRB) technologies for restriction of the movement of lead and nickel ions in the groundwater. Outputs of flask and tank tests certified that this material could capture these ions with sorption efficiency greater than 95% at time, pH, sorbent dosage, and speed equal to 60 min, 4 for lead and 6 for nickel, 2.5 g/100 mL, and 250 rpm, respectively. Sorption isotherm measurements were represented in a good manner by Langmuir model in comparison with Freundlich model with coefficient of determination (R2) greater than 0.99. So, the chemisorption was the predominant mechanism which could be supported by O-H, H-O-H, C-O, O-Si-O, and Si-O functional groups based on the Fourier transform infrared analysis. The maximum sorption capacity of WFS was 13.966 and 4.227 mg/g for lead and nickel ions, respectively, with corresponding affinities equal to 0.647 and 0.099 L/mg. Measurements signified that the hydraulic conductivity of WFS was 3.8 × 10−7 cm/s which satisfies the requirements of LPB. To obtain the acceptable values of permeability and reactivity, PRB was prepared from mixing 18% WFS with 82% filter sand. COMSOL software was able to simulate the measurements of two-dimensional tank packed with Iraqi soil aquifer in combination with WFS-LPB and WFS-filter sand PRB. Thicker barriers have a high ability in the protection of locations in the down-gradient side because their longevity increased dramatically with increase of barrier thickness.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Albert Ebo Duncan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The threat posed by illegal mining to the quality of water resources in Ghana has become a major public concern due to the closing down of some water treatment plants in the country. This study aimed to investigate heavy metal pollution in Fena River due to the illegal mining activities. The study was based on 72 samples from six sampling points for a period of 12 months (January–December). Six heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in water were investigated from Fena River in the Amansie Central District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The ranges of the heavy metals in water were BDL–1.041, 0.01–0.703, BDL–0.24, 0.17–16.43, 0.46–1.02, and BDL for Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Hg. Three metals exceeded the safe drinking water guidelines making water generally unsafe for drinking and domestic purposes. According to Nemerow’s pollution index results, three metals, namely, Cd, Pb, and Fe, were the principal metal pollutants in the study area, whereas Hg, Cu, and Zn were found not to contribute to the pollution effect. However, of the polluting metals, only Cd polluted all the six sampling sites, whereas Pb polluted five out of the six sampling sites. The most striking of the results is the absence of mercury in all the sites studied. The findings from the water quality index confirm that only two of the sites recorded marginal water quality, whereas the remaining four sites recorded poor water quality. The high levels of heavy metals polluting water and the deteriorating water quality are due to the illegal mining activities occurring within and around Fena River.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to realize the connection for metal foil, a longitudinal-torsional compound consolidation vibration system is proposed, and relative experiments are carried out. Firstly, the structure of longitudinal-torsional compound consolidation vibration system was designed, detailed structural design of the compound piezoelectric transducer and the compound horn in the vibration system was carried out, and torsional vibration analysis of the compound horn with spiral grooves was carried out based on mechanical principle. Secondly, modal calculation and harmonic response analysis of longitudinal-torsional compound consolidation vibration system were carried out, and corresponding vibration mode and harmonic frequency were obtained. The effect of structural parameters for the compound horn on the frequency of the consolidation vibration system was analysed, and structural parameters of the compound horn were optimized. Finally, the prototype was made, and the experimental platform was built to test the amplitude. When the frequency is near 20000 Hz, the resonance is achieved in three directions at the same time, and the resonance frequency is 19800 Hz. Through the frequency-scanning test, the maximum longitudinal amplitude of the consolidation vibration system is 16 μm, and the maximum torsional amplitudes of X and Y are 7.9 μm and 8.1 μm. The longitudinal-torsional compound consolidation vibration system can realize the connection of the same and different metal foils and has broad application prospects.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jun Ren</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Qianghao Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Structural dynamic modification is a popular approach to obtain desire frequencies and dynamic characteristics. It has been observed that reanalyzing the modified structure usually involves complicated calculations when modifications are concerned with numerous degrees of freedom (DOFs), especially adding substructures to these DOFs. This paper proposed a method to reanalyze the frequency response functions (FRFs) of structures with multiple co-ordinates modifications. Two different cases are taken into consideration in the modifications, including adding (or decreasing) masses, stiffness, and damping, as well as adding spring-mass substructures, which makes the method more practical. This method is developed by employing Sherman–Morrison and Woodbury (SMW) formula based on the FRFs related to the modifications coordinates of the original system. The advantage of this method is that neither a physical model nor a modal model is required; instead, it needs only the FRFs, which can be directly measured by experimental modal testing. Another salient feature of this proposed strategy is that the FRFs of the modified structure can be calculated in only one step. Validation of this proposed method is demonstrated using various numerical examples. It is shown that the method is very effective and can be considered for real applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aims. Tripartite motif protein 36 (TRIM36) plays a tumor-suppressive role in prostate cancer. However, there is little information on the clinical relevance of TRIM36 expression in esophageal cancer (ESCA). Methods. TRIM36 expression was analyzed by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ESCA dataset as well as by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on samples from our hospital. Results. In the current study, the analysis of TCGA ESCA dataset suggested the decreased expression of TRIM36 in ESCA tissues. Further analyses on samples from our hospital demonstrated that TRIM36 was significantly downregulated in ESCA tissues than in the noncancerous controls at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis on TCGA ESCA dataset suggested that TRIM36 expression was inversely correlated with the β-catenin pathway. IHC staining data showed that 66.25% (53/80) and 51.25% (41/80) of ESCA cases had a low expression of TRIM36 and a high expression of β-catenin, respectively. By Fisher’s exact test, we found that TRIM36 protein expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.0104), tumor stage (P=0.0169), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0021), vital status (P=0.0443), and β-catenin expression (P=0.0329). These findings suggest the potential clinical significance of TRIM36 in ESCA. Kaplan–Meier and log-rank test demonstrated that a low expression of TRIM6 and a high expression of β-catenin were associated with poor overall survival of ESCA patients. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence for the prognostic value of TRIM36 in ESCA.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zakiah I. Kalantan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Data scientists use various machine learning algorithms to discover patterns in large data that can lead to actionable insights. In general, high-dimensional data are reduced by obtaining a set of principal components so as to highlight similarities and differences. In this work, we deal with the reduced data using a bivariate mixture model and learning with a bivariate Gaussian mixture model. We discuss a heuristic for detecting important components by choosing the initial values of location parameters using two different techniques: cluster means, k-means and hierarchical clustering, and default values in the “mixtools” R package. The parameters of the model are obtained via an expectation maximization algorithm. The criteria from Bayesian point are evaluated for both techniques, demonstrating that both techniques are efficient with respect to computation capacity. The effectiveness of the discussed techniques is demonstrated through a simulation study and using real data sets from different fields.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Dandan Yang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper investigates the three-way clustering involving fuzzy covering, thresholds acquisition, and boundary region processing. First of all, a valid fuzzy covering of the universe is constructed on the basis of an appropriate fuzzy similarity relation, which helps capture the structural information and the internal connections of the dataset from the global perspective. Due to the advantages of valid fuzzy covering, we explore the valid fuzzy covering instead of the raw dataset for RFCM algorithm-based three-way clustering. Subsequently, from the perspective of semantic interpretation of balancing the uncertainty changes in fuzzy sets, a method of partition thresholds acquisition combining linear and nonlinear fuzzy entropy theory is proposed. Furthermore, boundary regions in three-way clustering correspond to the abstaining decisions and generate uncertain rules. In order to improve the classification accuracy, the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is utilized to reduce the objects in the boundary regions. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed three-way clustering based on fuzzy covering and kNN-FRFCM algorithm is better than the compared algorithms in most cases.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Weixiang Xu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jinggui Gao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, an optimal portfolio control problem of DC pension is studied where the time interval between the implementation of investment behavior and its effectiveness (hereafter input-delay) is particularly focused. There are two assets available for investment: a risk-free cash bond and a risky stock with a jump-diffusion process. And the wealth process of the pension fund is modeled as a stochastic delay differential equation. To secure a comfortable retirement life for pension members and also avoid excessive risk, the fund managers in this paper aim to minimize the expected value of quadratic deviations between the actual terminal fund scale and a preset terminal target. By applying the stochastic dynamic programming approach and the match method, the optimal portfolio control problem is solved and the closed-form solution is obtained. In addition, an algorithm is developed to calculate the numerical solution of the optimal strategy. Finally, we have performed a sensitivity analysis to explore how the managers’ preset terminal target, the length of input-delay, and the jump intensity of risky assets affect the optimal investment strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ming Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Guo-Liang He</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we investigate a five-component Gross–Pitaevskii equation, which is demonstrated to describe the dynamics of an F=2 spinor Bose–Einstein condensate in one dimension. By employing the Hirota method with an auxiliary function, we obtain the explicit bright one- and two-soliton solutions for the equation via symbolic computation. With the choice of polarization parameter and spin density, the one-soliton solutions are divided into four types: one-peak solitons in the ferromagnetic and cyclic states and one- and two-peak solitons in the polar states. For the former two, solitons share the similar shape of one peak in all components. Solitons in the polar states have the one- or two-peak profiles, and the separated distance between two peaks is inversely proportional to the value of polarization parameter. Based on the asymptotic analysis, we analyze the collisions between two solitons in the same and different states.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The construction industry continues to be one of the industries with the highest accident rate. Tower cranes have always been the central component of many construction operations. With recent advancements in tower cranes, more efforts have been made for their safe operation. The impact of natural environmental factors on the operation of tower cranes cannot be ignored, especially the impact of the wind load, which can be found in construction regulations worldwide. Therefore, a large number of recent studies have focused on exploring different approaches to improving the impact of loads, such as improved feedback controllers and collocated sensors. However, there are few studies on the impact of the flexible cable pendulum system under wind load. To quantify the impact in this paper, first, the swing model of the hanging and the model of sling fluctuation are proposed as the base. Second, the flexible cable pendulum model is designed for the impact of tower cranes under wind load. By field experiments, the applicability of the model in practical use is analyzed. A case of the Crane Beach Hydropower Station is investigated as a demonstration. With MATLAB programming, the variation in the hanging impulse with wind speed is shown, indicating that the maximum wind speed should be 12 m/s if the factors that people can control are considered. When considering the factors that can be harmful to humans, the maximum wind speed is 17 m/s. With the proposed model, the impacts of wind load on tower crane operation can be quantified without actual deployment, offering a more straightforward quantitative tool for safe regulations and engineering management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For pipes connected by pipe joints, leaks in the pipeline system are likely to occur at the pipe joints as opposed to the tube itself. Thus, early detection is critical to ensure the safety of the pipeline system. Based on acoustic emission (AE) techniques, this paper presents an experimental research on small leak detection in gas distribution pipelines due to loosening of the pipe joint connection. Firstly, the acoustic characteristics of leak signals are studied; then, features of signals are extracted. Finally, a classifier based on the support vector machine (SVM) technology is established, and the qualified features are selected to detect the leak. It is verified that the main frequency of the AE small leak signal due to the failure of the pipe joint is focused in the range of 33–45 kHz, and the algorithms based on SVM with kernel functions all can reach a better estimation accuracy of 98% using the feature “envelope area” or the feature set {standard deviation (STD), root mean square (RMS), energy, average frequency}.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) with progression to oliguric or anuric acute renal failure (ARF) is often related to use of well-known nephrotoxic agents including medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and certain classes of antibiotics. Hyperosmolar IV contrast is also a well-known nephrotoxic agent. Severe sepsis with subsequent hypotension, marked hyperglycemia, and those with difficulty accessing water or with poor oral intake can also present with acute kidney injury related to kidney hypoperfusion, dehydration, and volume depletion. In this case report, we discover and discuss the possible effects of regular and daily occupational exposure of jet fuel (a mixture of hydrocarbons) on renal function. Jet fuel is an underdescribed and not well-known nephrotoxic agent; however, its direct toxicity on kidney function appears to be reversible with removal of exposure and aggressive fluid hydration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is commonly used as treatment of certain autoimmune neurological diseases (ANDs), and its main objective is the removal of pathogenic autoantibodies. Our aim was to describe the clinical profile and the experience with the usage of TPE in patients with ANDs at our institution. Methods. This is an observational retrospective study, including medical records of patients with diagnosis of ANDs who received TPE, between 2011 and 2018. Characteristics of TPE, such as number of cycles, type of replacement solution, and adverse effects, were evaluated. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was applied to measure the clinical response after the therapy. Results. 187 patients were included with the following diagnoses: myasthenia gravis (MG), n = 70 (37%); Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), n = 53 (28.3%), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), n = 35 (18.7%); chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), n = 23 (12.2%); and autoimmune encephalitis (AE), n = 6 (3.2%). The most used types of replacement solution were albumin (n = 131, 70%) and succinylated gelatin (n = 45, 24%). All patients received a median of five cycles (IQR 5-5). Hypotension and hydroelectrolytic disorders were the main complications. After TPE, 99 patients (52.9%) showed improvement in the mRS scores and a statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) was seen between the admission score and after TPE for every diagnosis except for CIDP. Conclusion. TPE has an adequate safety profile, and improvement in functionality in treated patients reflects its effectiveness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The prominent performance of wave elimination and energy absorption makes calcareous sand important and useful in infrastructure construction and protection engineering. Due to the high compressibility induced by remarkable intragranular void and irregular shape, calcareous sand presents different mechanical behaviors from common terrestrial sands. Considerable efforts have been made to explore the static and dynamic mechanical properties of calcareous sand. In this paper, a series of monotonous experiments have been performed on calcareous sand utilizing the electrohydraulic servo-controlled test apparatus designed by the Global Digital Systems Ltd (GDS). The effects of confining pressure and relative density on the mechanical properties of dry, drained, and undrained saturated sand were studied, and the underlying micromechanism of deformation and failure was discussed. It can be found that the residual stress of dry calcareous sand is independent of the relative density, while the peak stress and residual stress of drainage saturated sand have a positive correlation with the relative density. The increase of confining pressure makes the strain softening more remarkable and heightens the peak stress and residual stress. The stress-strain curve of calcareous sand can be divided into two portions: prepeak portion and postpeak softening portion. For the dry sand and drainage saturated sand, the softened part can be partitioned into three phases, i.e., accelerated phase, steady phase, and degradation phase, while the undrained saturated sand tends to hyperbolic softening. A mathematical model composed of a hyperbolic function and an inverted S-shaped function was formulated to describe the multiphase characteristic, in which the setting of parameter p expands its applicability. The experimental result validated the model, showing that the model can better describe the monotonic stress-strain relationship of calcareous sand. Besides, the physical meanings of model parameters were discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a user-friendly, comprehensive, fully integrated web- and mobile-based application that was specifically developed to guide learners and help them practice and train in pulpal and periapical diagnosis. Methods. The software was designed for assistance in the diagnosis of the pulpal and the periapical area. The software contained questions and tests, e.g., presence or absence of signs and symptoms, cold test, percussion, palpation, and radiographic examination that the user must answer to arrive at the final diagnosis. An electronic survey was prepared to evaluate the effectiveness, productivity, and accurateness of the software. The software and the electronic evaluation survey were sent by e-mail to dental students, endodontist, general dentists, and dental interns who study or work in four Saudi dental colleges. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Result. A total of 203 questionnaires were completed. Results showed that 29% of the participants were highly satisfied with the software; 40% gave a very good rating about the application satisfaction, while only 2% reported a poor degree of satisfaction with the software. Results also showed that students accurately selected the correct diagnosis but received relatively low diagnostic proficiency scores because they did not request diagnostic data in a pattern similar to experts. Conclusion. In conclusion, the software is promising as an effective and efficient tool for teaching and assessing the diagnostic skills of learners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>General contracting has gradually become the mainstream mode of project production organizations and the breakthrough point for the transformation of construction industry in China with the deepening of project management and project implementation reform. A general contractor needs to have a clear understanding of the structure and internal mechanism of its capability to achieve sustainable development. This study aimed to explore the critical influencing factors of general contractor capability and interrelationships between these factors in the context of transformation of Chinese construction industry. Fourteen critical factors influencing the general contractor’s capability were identified through literature review and questionnaire survey. Then, the interrelationships between factors were revealed through interpretive structural modeling (ISM). The factors were divided into four groups using the Matrice d’Impacts croises-multipication applique a classement (MICMAC) in accordance with driving power and dependence power. The results indicate that particular attention should be paid to enterprise culture at present. A strategy to improve the capability of general contractor was proposed. The results contribute to the construction of the theoretical system of general contractor capability. These research findings can thus act as a practical reference for future research attempting to provide technological and managerial solutions for promoting the development of general contracting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chemokine receptor CXCR5-mediated control of B cell trafficking in the lymphoid tissues plays a central role in orchestrating the B cell function, which not only guides the colocalization of B cells with follicular helper T cells in the follicular mantle zone but also determines the position of germinal center dark and light zones. However, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of CXCR5 in B cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the expression level of CXCR5 in B cells was substantially reduced in vitro culture conditions, while being maintained in the presence of CD40 signals. Furthermore, CD40 signaling promotes CXCR5 expression in B cells at least partially through noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway activation. However, other non-B cells also contributed to the optimal expression of CXCR5 in B cells through cell-cell contact and cytokine secretion. Our findings suggest that CD40 signaling-mediated activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway promotes the expression of CXCR5 in a B cell-intrinsic way to orchestrate the trafficking of B cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Focusing on green chemistry protocols, a series of carbohydrate derivatives (5a–l) have been synthesized by Fischer glycosylation of α-D-glucose, D-xylose, and α-maltose with several nonpolar phenolic ester aglycones (3a–d) derived from menthol by employing solid-supported Si-H+ as the catalyst. In order to study the extent of mesomorphism in target molecules, the thermotropic behaviour has been studied by using the thermoanalytic DSC/TGA technique and polarized optical microscope. Phase transitions in the DSC thermograms of 5a–l with two endothermic melting point peaks and various exothermic crystalline transitions exhibits the existence of mesophases. However, optical photomicrographs revealed that the new glycopyranosides formed smectic A phases. Moreover, all the compounds (3a–d and 5a–l) were confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. JMJD2B has been reported to be implicated in malignant tumors. This study is aimed at exploring the expression and prognostic significance of JMJD2B in osteosarcoma and its association with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). Methods. The histopathological and clinical characteristics were retrospectively reviewed from 53 osteosarcoma patients. JMJD2B and HIF1 were examined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma samples, and their association with clinical characteristics was examined by Spearman’s test. Overall survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and prognostic factors were identified by univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results. JMJD2B and HIF1 expression levels were both significantly associated with Enneking stage, distant metastasis, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the JMJD2B and HIF1 expressions were positively correlated (p&lt;0.001, R=0.752). In addition, univariate analysis showed that the expression of both JMJD2B and HIF1 was significantly associated with overall survival, but multivariate analysis showed that only JMJD2B expression was significantly associated with overall survival in osteosarcoma patients. Conclusions. JMJD2B and HIF1 expression levels show significant correlation with osteosarcoma progression, and JMJD2B could predict poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jason Hou</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Tremendous work has been done in the Light Water Reactor (LWR) Modelling and Simulation (M&amp;S) uncertainty quantification (UQ) within the framework of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) LWR Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling (UAM) benchmark, which aims to investigate the uncertainty propagation in all M&amp;S stages of the LWRs and to guide uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methodology development. The Best-Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodologies have been developed and implemented within the framework of the LWR UAM benchmark to provide a realistic predictive simulation capability without compromising the safety margins. This paper describes the current status of the methodological development, assessment, and integration of the BEPU methodology to facilitate the multiscale, multiphysics LWR core analysis. The comparative analysis of the results in the stand-alone multiscale neutronics phase (Phase I) is first reported for understanding the general trend of the uncertainty of core parameters due to the nuclear data uncertainty. It was found that the predicted uncertainty of the system eigenvalue is highly dependent on the choice of the covariance libraries used in the UQ process and is less sensitive to the solution method, nuclear data library, and UQ method. High-to-Low (Hi2Lo) model information approaches for multiscale M&amp;S are introduced for the core single physics phase (Phase II). In this phase, the other physics (fuel and moderator), providing feedback to neutronics M&amp;S in a LWR core, and time-dependent phenomena are considered. Phase II is focused on uncertainty propagation in single physics models which are components of the LWR core coupled multiphysics calculations. The paper discusses the link and interactions between Phase II to the multiphysics core and system phase (Phase III), that is, the link between uncertainty propagation in single physics on local scale and multiphysics uncertainty propagation on the core scale. Particularly, the consistency in uncertainty assessment between higher-fidelity models implemented in fuel performance codes and the rather simplified models implemented in thermal-hydraulics codes, to be used for coupling with neutronics in Phase III is presented. Similarly, the uncertainty quantification on thermal-hydraulic models is established on a relatively small scale, while these results will be used in Phase III at the core scale, sometimes with different codes or models. Lastly, the up-to-date UQ method for the coupled multiphysics core calculation in Phase III is presented, focusing on the core equilibrium cycle depletion calculation with associated uncertainties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To determine the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in erythrocytes and blood plasma, and the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes in patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment due to difficult-to-heal “skin wounds”. Material and Methods. Indices of oxidative stress were assessed in venous blood taken from 23 patients three times: immediately before HBO procedure, approx. 5 minutes after leaving the hyperbaric chamber, and after 25 HBO procedures. Moreover, selected blood counts were measured in the collected material two times: prior to treatment and after 25 HBO procedures. Results. A statistically significant positive correlation between the CAT activity and the TBARS concentration in the erythrocytes of patients was found before treatment in the hyperbaric chamber (r=0.394; P≤0.05). No statistically significant changes in the TBARS concentration in erythrocytes and blood plasma were observed both after the first HBO procedure and after 25 procedures. No statistically significant changes in the activities of CAT, SOD, and GPx were noted. Platelet count decreased by 18.7% (P≤0.05) after 25 HBO procedures. Granulocyte count decreased by approx. 21% (P≤0.05), and granulocyte percentage by 11.8% (P≤0.01). In turn, the percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes increased after the treatment by 16.6% (P&lt;0.05) and 16.4% (P&lt;0.05), respectively. Conclusions. Exposure to HBO due to difficult-to-heal skin wounds does not significantly affect the levels of oxidative stress in the peripheral blood of patients and, from the point of view of oxidation–reduction processes, appears to be a safe therapeutic method for the treatment of chronic wounds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is a bidirectional relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and depression/anxiety. Emerging evidences indicate that the liver may be involved in microbiota-gut-brain axis. This experiment focused on the role of melatonin in regulating the gut microbiota and explores its mechanism on dextran sulphate sodium- (DSS-) induced neuroinflammation and liver injury. Long-term DSS-treatment increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proinflammation cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, and gut leak in rats, breaking blood-brain barrier and overactivated astrocytes and microglia. Ultimately, the rats showed depression-like behavior, including reduction of sucrose preference and central time in open field test and elevation of immobility time in a forced swimming test. Oral administration with melatonin alleviated neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors. However, melatonin supplementation did not decrease the level of LPS but increase short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production to protect DSS-induced neuroinflammation. Additionally, western blotting analysis suggested that signaling pathways farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FXR-FGF 15) in gut and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in the liver overactivated in DSS-treated rats, indicating liver metabolic disorder. Supplementation with melatonin markedly inhibited the activation of these two signaling pathways and its downstream p38. As for the gut microbiota, we found that immune response- and SCFA production-related microbiota, like Lactobacillus and Clostridium significantly increased, while bile salt hydrolase activity-related microbiota, like Streptococcus and Enterococcus, significantly decreased after melatonin supplementation. These altered microbiota were consistent with the alleviation of neuroinflammation and metabolic disorder. Taken together, our findings suggest melatonin contributes to reshape gut microbiota and improves inflammatory processes in the hippocampus (HPC) and metabolic disorders in the liver of DSS rats.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aim. To evaluate cardiovascular, autonomic, and oxidative stress markers in eutrophic and overweight offspring of hypertensive parents comparing them to eutrophic and overweight offspring of normotensive parents. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study. We selected 71 male and sedentary subjects, divided into 4 groups: eutrophic group with a negative family history of hypertension (EH-, n=18) or positive family history of hypertension (EH+, n=17), overweight group with a negative family history of hypertension (OH-, n=19) or a positive family history of hypertension (OH+, n=17), and aged between 18 and 35 years. Results. Blood glucose was higher in the OH+ group when compared to other groups. Diastolic blood pressure was increased in OH- and OH+ groups when compared to eutrophic groups. Regarding the HRV, the LF abs was higher in OH- and OH+ groups when compared to the EH- group. LF/HF values were higher in EH+ and OH+ groups when compared to the EH- and OH- groups. As to oxidative stress and the metabolism of nitric oxide, we observed an increase in hydrogen peroxide and nitrite levels in the OH+ group, and in the NADPH oxidase in OH- and OH+ groups when compared to the other groups. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that the overweight group with a family history of hypertension presented all the dysfunctions observed in isolation from these risk factors. We observed an exacerbation of cardiac sympathetic modulation and early prooxidants increase, which may be associated with target organ damage and cardiovascular risk in this population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Abnormal body mass index (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) has become a major global public health problem which is rising at a faster rate in urban areas of low- and middle-income countries. In Ethiopia, the prevalence gradually increases. Long-distance truckers are at a high risk of developing overweight or obesity due to the sedentary nature of their job. Despite these populations at a high risk of developing overweight/obesity such as drivers elsewhere, pieces of data that showed the prevalence and contributing factors of overweight and obesity among long-distance truckers in Ethiopia are not yet available. Objective. To assess the prevalence and contributing factors of overweight and obesity among long-distance truckers in Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 systematically selected truckers at Modjo dry port in Ethiopia from February to March, 2018. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The final results were presented in tables and numerical summary measures such as mean and standard deviation (SD). Results. Of the 400 truckers interviewed, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 56.5%, 95% CI (51.6%–61.4%). The study also found that a monthly income ≥220 USD (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI (1.05–3.18)), having 3 or more family sizes (AOR = 2.24, 95% CI (1.15–4.36)), less than 6 hours of sleep at night (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI (1.99–5.78)), driving for 9 or more hours daily (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI (1.09–4.81)), and a truck driving experience of 10 or more years (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI (1.29–4.18)) were significantly associated with overweight and obesity. Conclusion. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was substantially high. The study also found that sociodemographic and occupational factors are mainly associated with overweight and obesity. Therefore, a health education program should be designed for awareness creation on the importance of reducing a sedentary lifestyle, consuming healthy foods or drinks, and having regular physical exercise to mitigate the problem.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Junjie Feng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A multiple measurement vector (MMV) model blocks sparse signal recovery. ISAR imaging algorithm is proposed to improve ISAR imaging quality. Firstly, the sparse imaging model is built, and block sparse signal recovery algorithm-based MMV model is applied to ISAR imaging. Then, a negative exponential function is proposed to approximately block L0 norm. The optimization solution of smoothed function is obtained by constructing a decreasing sequence. Finally, the correction steps are added to ensure the optimal solution of the block sparse signal along the fastest descent direction. Several simulations and real data simulation experiments verify the proposed algorithm has advantages in imaging time and quality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, was used to prevent and treat many diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer. In recent years, there are some reports about the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma with ginseng monomer compounds, but there is no systematic study on the related core targets and mechanism of ginseng in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma up to now. Therefore, this study systematically and comprehensively studied the molecular mechanism of ginseng in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma based on network pharmacology and further proved the potential targets by A549 cell experiments for the first time. Methods. The targets of disease and drug were obtained from Gene database. Subsequently, the compound-target network was constructed, and the core potential targets were screened out by plug-in into Cytoscape. Furthermore, the core targets and mechanism of ginseng in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma were verified by MTT test, cell scratch test, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Results. 1791 disease targets and 144 drug targets were obtained by searching the Gene database. Meanwhile, 15 core targets were screened out: JUN, MAPK8, PTGS2, CASP3, VEGFA, MMP9, AKT1, TNF, FN1, FOS, MMP782, IL-1β, IL-2, ICAM1, and HMOX1. The results of cell experiments indicate that ginseng could treat lung adenocarcinoma by cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. In addition, according to the results of the 15 core targets by qRT-PCR, JUN, IL-1β, IL-2, ICAM1, HMOX1, MMP9, and MMP2 are upregulated core targets, while PTGS2 and TNF are downregulated core targets. Conclusion. This study systematically and comprehensively studied 15 core targets by network pharmacology for the first time. Subsequently, it is verified that 9 core targets for ginseng treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, namely, JUN, IL-1β, IL-2, ICAM1, HMOX1, MMP9, MMP2, PTGS2, and TNF, are closely related to the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells. This study has reference value for the clinical application of ginseng in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Human body surfaces, such as the skin, intestines, and respiratory and urogenital tracts, are colonized by a large number of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, with the gut being the most densely and extensively colonized organ. The microbiome plays an essential role in immune system development and tissue homeostasis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis not only modulates the immune responses of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but also impacts the immunity of distal organs, such as the lung, further affecting lung health and respiratory diseases. Here, we review the recent evidence of the correlations and underlying mechanisms of the relationship between the gut microbiota and common respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), lung cancer, and respiratory infection, and probiotic development as a therapeutic intervention for these diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As progressive organ shortage in cardiac transplantation demands extension of donor criteria, effort is needed to optimize graft survival. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, generated during organ procurement, transplantation, and reperfusion, contribute to acute and late graft dysfunction. The combined application of diverse substances acting via different molecular pathways appears to be a reasonable approach to face the complex mechanism of ischemia reperfusion injury. Thus, an antioxidant solution containing α-ketoglutaric acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, N-acetyl-L-methionine, and N-acetyl-selenium-L-methionine was combined with endogenous angiotensin-(1-7). Its capacity of myocardial protection was investigated in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to warm and cold ischemia. The physiological cardiac parameters were assessed throughout the experiments. Effects were evaluated via determination of the oxidative stress parameters malondialdehyde and carbonyl proteins as well as immunohistochemical and ultrastructural tissue analyses. It was shown that a combination of 20% (v/v) antioxidant solution and 220 pM angiotensin-(1-7) led to the best results with a preservation of heart tissue against oxidative stress and morphological alteration. Additionally, immediate cardiac recovery (after warm ischemia) and normal physiological performance (after cold ischemia) were recorded. Overall, the results of this study indicate substantial cardioprotection of the novel combination with promising prospective for future clinical use.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Numerous evidences suggest that plant polyphenols may have therapeutic benefits in regulating oxidative stress and providing neuroprotection in many neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, these mechanisms are not yet completely understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of olive leaf polyphenols on oxidative stress through oxidation marker level and activity (TBARS, SOD, and GPX) and their protein expression (SOD1, SOD2, and GPX1), as well as the protein expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and microglia markers (Iba-1, CD206, and iNOS) and myelin integrity (proteolipid protein expression) in the brain of rats with induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and subjected to olive leaf therapy. Experiments were performed in male EAE DA rats, which were randomly divided into 2 main groups: EAE groups treated with the therapy of olive leaf (EAE+TOL) and untreated EAE control groups. The EAE treated groups consumed olive leaf tea instead of drinking water (ad libitum) from the beginning to the end of the experiment. In addition, olive leaf extract was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for the 10 continuous days and started on the 8th day after EAE induction. The clinical course was monitored in both groups until the 30th day after EAE induction. Our results demonstrated that TOL attenuated the clinical course of EAE; reduced the oxidative stress (by decreasing the concentration of MDA); upregulated antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, and GPX1), SIRT1 (overall and microglial), and anti-inflammatory M2 microglia; downregulated proinflammatory M1 type; and preserved myelin integrity. These data support the idea that TOL may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Psoriasis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by cutaneous lesions in plaques. It has been proposed that the immune response has a key role in the disease progression. Particularly, the Th17 cells through IL-17 can contribute to maintain the inflammatory process. The pathogenic Th17 phenotype has been described in human diseases and associated with high severity in inflammatory experimental models. However, it is not clear if the pathogenic phenotype could be present in the skin and peripheral blood as well as its possible association to severity in psoriasis. In the lesional skin, we found high infiltration of Th17 cells and the pathogenic phenotype, finding a correlation between the frequency of Th17 cells and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. In peripheral blood, we observed a pool of Th17 lymphocytes with potential to acquire pathogenic features. Interestingly, the percentage of pathogenic Th17 cells (CD4+ RORγt+ IFN-γ+) correlates with disease severity. Moreover, we distinguished three groups of patients based on their IL-17/IFN-γ production by Th17 lymphocytes, which seems to be related with a dynamic or stable potential to express these cytokines. Remarkably, we evaluated the cytokine production by Th17 cells as an immunological marker for the adequate selection of biologic therapy. We found that patients analyzed by this immunological approach and treated with antibodies against IL-17 and TNFα showed great improvement depicted by reduction in PASI and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score as well as the percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA). Altogether, our results highlight the importance of the assessment of the pathogenic phenotype in Th17 cells as an immune personalized analysis with the potential to support the therapy choice in the clinical practice.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Michael Decker</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The authors present a case of WLCS after femoral neck fracture fixation. While this is a rare complication, a high index of suspicion should exist. Surgeons should use well leg holders with caution and limit utilization time. Alternative methods of positioning to allow for fluoroscopic imaging exist. WLCS remains a clinical diagnosis; intracompartmental measurements can be used but should be cautiously interpreted. When the diagnosis of WLCS is made, emergent fasciotomies of the affected compartments should be performed. Surgeons should be aware of this complication when using a well leg holder and the potential catastrophic consequences if left ignored.</dc:description>

<dc:description>By applying early disturbance to the concrete, the influence of the disturbance on the macroscopic mechanical properties of basalt fiber concrete during the period from the initial setting to the final setting is explored, and the influence mechanism is revealed. Also, the influence of this disturbance on the process of sulfate erosion of concrete is evaluated by the sulfate erosion test and by the ultrasonic data acquisition of its damage process. The experimental results show that the flexural strength of basalt fiber concrete is increased after the concrete has been disturbed in the early stage of condensation but is decreased in the middle stage of condensation and is not affected in the later stage. When the condensation and hardening processes are disturbed, damage is caused inside the concrete, which is greater with the increase in the condensation degree until the penetration resistance reaches about 15 MPa, which then is more and more reduced. The durability of basalt fiber concrete is reduced by disturbance, which has a significant effect on it when the penetration resistance is between 7 MPa and 16 MPa.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Shale fired heat-insulation block, which is made of shale, fly ash, building rubbish, and waste paper, is a new type environment-friendly product. In order to study the mechanical properties of shale fired heat-insulation block walls, four full-scale walls were tested under El-Centro, Taft, and Ninghe earthquakes using shaking table equipment, in which the influence of the spacing of cast-in-place belt and the connection between the wall and the frame on the out-of-plane seismic performance of the wall was taken into account. The subject of this study is mainly about out-of-plane dynamic response of masonry walls in terms of frequency, displacement, and acceleration. It could be concluded that the cast-in-place belt and the rigid connection between wall and RC frame could effectively reduce the out-of-plane seismic response of the infill masonry wall. Finally, the recommendations for the use of this type of block in the structure are given.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Strengthening the attached old cement mortar of recycled aggregate (RA) is a common approach to enhance the RA properties. In this study, four representative chemical enhancing-technologies were chosen. Through the analysis of physical properties, mechanical properties, and shape indexes, the changes of performance before and after strengthening were tested, so as to grasp the influence of chemical enhancing-technologies on the performance of RA. The results indicated that the chemical strengthening methods had obvious influence on the physical properties of RA, such as density and water absorption. Due to the different chemical enhancing mechanism, the influence trend and range were varied. The mechanical properties of RA such as crushing value and abrasion value were obviously improved by chemical enhancement. However, chemical enhancement had an effect on the shape of RA, which will slightly reduce the angularity index and sphericity index. The texture index of RA with C-3 and C-7 decreased sharply, but texture index increased after abrasion, and the discrepancy of aggregate texture index of different enhancing methods is significantly reduced. The microanalysis exhibited that the aggregate surface structure with C-3 and H was large, but there were a lot of fine structures on the aggregate surface with C-7 and N-P. Different chemical enhancing methods have different effects on the mechanical performance and microstructure of RA, but it should be noted that the fluctuation of RA performance tends to increase.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the difficulty of representing problem parameters fuzziness using the soft set theory, the fuzzy soft set is regarded to be more general and flexible than using the soft set. In this paper, we define the fuzzy soft linear operator T~ in the fuzzy soft Hilbert space H~ based on the definition of the fuzzy soft inner product space U~,·,·~ in terms of the fuzzy soft vector v~fGe modified in our work. Moreover, it is shown that ℂnA, ℝnA and ℓ2A are suitable examples of fuzzy soft Hilbert spaces and also some related examples, properties and results of fuzzy soft linear operators are introduced with proofs. In addition, we present the definition of the fuzzy soft orthogonal family and the fuzzy soft orthonormal family and introduce examples satisfying them. Furthermore, the fuzzy soft resolvent set, the fuzzy soft spectral radius, the fuzzy soft spectrum with its different types of fuzzy soft linear operators and the relations between those types are introduced. Moreover, the fuzzy soft right shift operator and the fuzzy soft left shift operator are defined with an example of each type on ℓ2A. In addition, it is proved, on ℓ2A, that the fuzzy soft point spectrum of fuzzy soft right shift operator has no fuzzy soft eigenvalues, the fuzzy soft residual spectrum of fuzzy soft right shift operator is equal to the fuzzy soft comparison spectrum of it and the fuzzy soft point spectrum of fuzzy soft left shift operator is the fuzzy soft open disk λ~&lt;~1~. Finally, it is shown that the fuzzy soft Hilbert space is fuzzy soft self-dual in this generalized setting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on the funding project “a concrete-filled steel tube truss type half-through arch bridge (CFSTTTHAB) with the span of 220 m,” in view of the difference of tension between one pair of suspenders, this paper proposed an improved influence matrix method for the tension of a single suspender, which was developed from a conventional influence matrix. A method for adjusting suspender tension at the completed state of construction by using numerical simulation and iterative algorithm was also presented. Finite element numerical model was used to calculate the influence matrix of a single suspender. Moreover, an iterative algorithm was used to solve the adjustment value of suspender tension. Based on the proposed method, by processing several iterations, the difference between the measured and designed suspender tension would be controlled within 6% in the projects of suspender tension adjustment. Finally, the comparison between the measured and designed suspender tension at the completed state of construction proved the feasibility and accuracy satisfaction of the proposed method for engineering requirement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ganoderma lucidum, mushroom used for centuries by Asian peoples as food supplement, has been shown interesting biological activities, including over the Central Nervous System. Besides, these mushroom bioactive compounds present antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. On the side, binge drinking paradigm consists of ethanol exposure that reflects the usual consumption of adolescents, which elicits deleterious effects, determined by high ethanol consumption, in a short period. In this study, we investigated whether the Aqueous Extract of G. lucidum (AEGl) reduces the behavioral disorders induced by alcohol. Male (n=30) and female Wistar rats (n=40), seventy-two days old, were used for behavioral/biochemical and oral toxicity test, respectively. Animals were exposed to 5 binges (beginning at 35 days old) of ethanol (3 g/kg/day) or distilled water. Twenty-four hours after the last binge administration, animals received AEGl (100 mg/kg/day) or distilled water for three consecutive days. After treatment protocol, open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and step-down inhibitory avoidance tests were performed. Oxidative stress parameters were measured to evaluate the REDOX balance. Our results demonstrated that AEGl elicited the recovery of spontaneous horizontal exploration capacity, anxiogenic- and depressive-profile, as well as short-term memory damage induced by binge-ethanol exposure. The behavioral effects of the extract were associated to the reequilibrium of the animals’ REDOX balance. Thus, AEGl, a medicinal mushroom, ameliorates behavioral alteration on a model of motor, cognitive and psychiatric-like disorders induced by binge drinking paradigm and emerges as a useful tool as a food supplement in the management of disorders of alcoholic origin.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Poor adherence to treatment instructions may play an important role in the failure of Helicobacter pylori eradication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of telephone-based reeducation on 14-day quadruple H. pylori eradication therapy. In total, 162 patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either the intervention group (patients received telephone-based reeducation on the 4th, 7th, and 10th days of the course) or the control group (patients received instructions only at the time of getting the prescriptions). All patients received a 14-day quadruple H. pylori eradication therapy. The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate. The secondary outcomes included the symptom relief rates and the incidence rates of adverse events. Seventy-five patients in the reeducation group and 74 patients in the control group completed the follow-up. The H. pylori eradication rate in the reeducation group was statistically higher than that in the control group (intention-to-treat: 72.8% vs. 50.6%, P=0.006; per-protocol: 78.7% vs. 55.4%, P=0.003). However, the symptom relief rates and the adverse event rates in these two groups were not significantly different. Overall, the results from this study suggest that telephone-based reeducation can be potentially applied to improve the H. pylori eradication rate in clinical practice, without significantly increasing the adverse effects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of the economic and technology, decision-making problems are more and more complex and uncertain. Experts have difficulty in expressing evaluation information because of different research background and insufficient cognition of knowledge structure. Attribute weight information has been often incomplete in decision-making problems. Considering that nested probabilistic-numerical linguistic term sets (NPNLTSs) are flexible to express qualitative and quantitative information, in this paper, we firstly establish an optimization model based on distance measures to obtain the attribute weight. Combined with a classical decision-making method, an optimization-based TOPSIS method with NPNLTSs is proposed to deal with complex decision-making problems. After that, a case study about the river health assessment is given to show the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. Finally, some comparative analysis and discussion are provided from three aspects, including the impact for the results without weight optimization, the impact for the results under other uncertain environments, and the impact for the results using other decision-making methods. As a result, the proposed optimization-based TOPSIS method is effective and reliable. The optimization-based TOPSIS method proposed in this paper provides a new way to deal with uncertain and practical problems, which makes a technically sound contribution to the decision-making field.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. A possible relationship between sleep bruxism (SB) and several sleep disorders has been suggested in children, which could influence sleep quality and quality of life. This study aims to assess such correlations in a large sample of school children. Methods. Parents of 741 consecutive children aged between 8 and 12 years filled the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). It evaluated 45 items grouped in 8 components: duration of night-time sleep, sleep latency, bedtime problems, sleep quality, night awakenings, nocturnal symptoms, morning symptoms, and daytime sleepiness. An item evaluating parental-reported tooth grinding was also included. Correlation analysis was performed between parental-reported tooth grinding and all the other items. Results. A significant correlation between parental-reported tooth grinding and several sleep disorders concerning bedtime problems, night awakenings, nocturnal symptoms, and morning symptoms has been found. In general, correlation strength of significant pairs was low, ranging from 0.092 (sleep apnea) to 0.234 (movement while falling asleep). Conclusions. Parental-reported tooth grinding in children is correlated, even if weakly, with some sleep disorders concerning the sphere of bedtime problems, night awakenings, nocturnal symptoms, breathing symptoms, and morning symptoms. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, with particular regard to the consistency of correlation outcomes between the parental reports and the sleep laboratory measures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To evaluate the safety and outcomes of primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PPCCC) combined with phacoemulsification in postvitrectomy eyes. Design. Retrospective case series. Methods. Twenty-one postvitrectomy eyes of 21 patients with cataract between April 2017 and December 2019 were enrolled. PPCCC through the cornea incision was performed before in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation. All patients were followed up for at least 3 months postoperatively. The outcome measures were corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal endothelium cell counts (CECC), central macular thickness (CMT), the occurrence of intraoperative or postoperative complications, and the incidence of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Results. The mean age was 56.14 ± 9.76 years (ranging from 31 to 68). The mean Snellen CDVA was 20/400 preoperatively and improved to 20/67 postoperatively P&lt;0.001. No significant differences were found between IOP P=0.96 and CMT P=0.42 preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean CECC was 2571.8 ± 319.3 cells/mm2 preoperatively and 2498.2 ± 346.3 cells/mm2 postoperatively P&lt;0.05. Lens epithelium cells proliferation was confined to the peripheral capsular bag during a mean follow-up of 12.9 ± 10.5 months (ranging from 3 to 28 months). Intraoperative posterior capsule extension occurred in 1 eye (4%), although it did not affect the patient’s vision. No serious complications, including retinal detachment or endophthalmitis, were detected in any of the 21 cases. Conclusion. PPCCC through cornea incision combined with phacoemulsification may be a safe and practical alternative to prevent PCO in postvitrectomy eyes with cataract.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Focusing on the issue of attitude tracking for low-cost and small-size Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in high dynamic environment, an Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (AUKF) method combining sensor fusion methodology with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proposed. The different control strategies are adopted by fusing multi-MEMS inertial sensors under various dynamic situations. The AUKF attitude determination approach utilizing the MEMS sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) can provide reliable estimation in these situations. In particular, the adaptive scale factor is used to adaptively weaken or enhance the effects on new measurement data according to the predicted residual vector in the estimation process. In order to solve the problem that the new measurement data is not available in case of GPS fault, an attitude algorithm based on Radial Basis Function (RBF)-ANN feedback correction is proposed for AUKF. The estimated deviation of predicted system state can be provided based on RBF-ANN in GPS-denied environment. The corrected predicted system state is used for the estimation process in AUKF. An experimental platform was setup to simulate the rotation of the spinning projectile. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance in terms of attitude estimation than other representative methods under various dynamic situations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To systematically evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine Qiju Dihuang Decoction (QDD) for hypertension. Methods. A comprehensive literature search of randomized controlled trials using QDD to treat hypertension was conducted in 7 electronic databases, including Chinese databases. Subjects and abstracts of the trials were read in NoteExpress for preliminary screening, and the full text was read for further screening. The data extraction table was made for the selected 19 trials, and risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane collaboration tool, followed by data analysis using Rev Man 5.3. Results. The antihypertensive efficacy of QDD is 1.45 times that of antihypertensive drugs and 1.56 times that of conventional therapies, which can also reduce the endothelin level. QPAD exhibits an antihypertensive effect, and its clinical efficacy is 1.34 times and 1.61 times that of antihypertensive drugs, which can not only significantly lower the diastolic blood pressure but also reduce the 24 h mean ambulate blood pressure. At the same time, it can decrease the TCM syndrome score, inhibit the inflammation, protect the renal function, reduce the insulin resistance, and improve the life quality of patients. Conclusion. QDD can effectively reduce blood pressure and improve the life quality of patients with hypertension, which plays a certain role in preventing hypertension complications. However, due to the methodological deficiencies, more rigorous randomized controlled trials will be needed in the future to provide stronger evidence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To compare ocular anatomy differences of lens subluxation between eyes with or without acute angle closure (AAC). Methods. This is a retrospective and case-control study. Sixty cases with mild lens subluxation were recruited. Among them, 30 eyes with acute angle closure were assigned to the AAC group and 30 eyes without AAC were assigned to the non-AAC group. The anterior segment was quantitatively evaluated by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The axial length (AL) was measured with IOL Master. All patients underwent lens extraction surgery and were followed up for six months. Results. The history of blunt trauma accounted for 22 (73.3%) cases in the AAC group and 21 (70%) cases in the non-AAC group. Fifteen (50%) patients in the AAC group had iridotomy history, and high intraocular pressure recurred. The UBM analysis showed that the average central chamber depth of the affected eyes in the AAC group was 1.82 mm, which was significantly shallower than that in the fellow eyes (2.58 mm, P&lt;0.05) or both eyes in the non-AAC group.Both eyes in the AAC group presented a shorter AL and shallower anterior chamber than the eyes in the non-AAC group. Conclusions. An asymmetrical anterior chamber between bilateral eyes is an important feature in lens subluxation-induced AAC. The crowded anterior chamber and shorter AL might be the anatomic basis for the eye with lens subluxation-induced AAC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Many patients remain anxious during intravitreal injections, despite its increasing use. As music can alleviate anxiety for other procedures, we wanted to evaluate its effect during intravitreal injection. Methods. Patients undergoing routine intravitreal injection were recruited for a randomized controlled trial. Subjects complete a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) questionnaire before and after undergoing injection with or without background music. They were also assessed for subjective satisfaction, anxiety, pain, and future preferences after the injection. Results. There were 39 and 37 Chinese subjects in the music (age 68.08 ± 13.67) and control (age 73.24 ± 11.17) groups, respectively. The music group reported lower anxiety and pain, and a greater reduction in STAI-S score, but the differences were not statistically significant (P=0.830, 0.655, 0.199, respectively). More subjects in the music group (92.3%, control group 64.9%) preferred music for future injections (P=0.003). Age, but not the number of previous injections, was negatively correlated with reported anxiety (r = −0.27, P=0.021). Conclusion. Most subjects preferred music during future injections. Although music reduced anxiety, the effect was not statistically significant and may be masked by the higher age of our control group, as increasing age was correlated with lower anxiety.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mining and understanding patients’ disease-development pattern is a major healthcare need. A huge number of research studies have focused on medical resource allocation, survivability prediction, risk management of diagnosis, etc. In this article, we are specifically interested in discovering risk factors for patients with high probability of developing cancers. We propose a systematic and data-driven algorithm and build around the idea of association rule mining. More precisely, the rule-mining method is firstly applied on the target dataset to unpack the underlying relationship of cancer-risk factors, via generating a set of candidate rules. Later, this set is represented as a rule graph, where informative rules are identified and selected with the aim of enhancing the result interpretability. Compared to hundreds of rules generated from the standard rule-mining approach, the proposed algorithm benefits from a concise rule subset, without losing the information from the original rule set. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated using one of the largest cancer data resources. We found that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of identifying informative rules and requires affordable computational time. Additionally, relevant information from the selected rules can also be used to inform health providers and authorities for cancer-risk management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Opportunities for sustainable agriculture development in Kenya which heavily depends on healthy soil and soil microbial diversity can be found in the promotion of organic farming. The increasing populations, higher demands for animal and plant products, climate change impacts, and weather conditions necessitate novel ideas and technologies to try reverse the adverse effects of excessive use of inorganic fertilizers and to maximize the potential of the land. Sapropel, a promising biological deposit from freshwater lakes, has found its limelight in its use in agricultural crop production as a soil conditioner and biofertilizer. This could be an ultimate practice for sustainable food and energy production in Kenya. This review aims at presenting information in the literature about the potential use of the organic fertilizer based on sapropels in intensified crop production and their main effects on plant growth. It discusses soil fertility, the composition of sapropels, and their application and advantages in agricultural production. It is evident from the review that sapropel can be considered as a resource that is valuable with wide application possibilities in agriculture. Sapropel can present an important contribution to the solution of the conservation of the fertility of the soil for integrated nutrient management systems to maintain agricultural productivity and help in environmental conservation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Study Design. Clinical case series. Background. Percutaneous stabilization for spinal trauma confers less blood loss, reduces postoperative pain, and is less invasive than open stabilization and fusion. The current standard of care includes instrumentation removal. Objective. 1. Reporting patient outcomes following minimally invasive posterior percutaneous pedicle screw-rod stabilization (PercStab). 2. Evaluating the results of instrumentation retention. Methods. A prospective observational study of 32 consecutive patients receiving PercStab without direct decompression or fusion. Baseline data demographics were collected. Operative outcomes of interest were operative room (OR) time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay. Follow-up variables of interest included patient satisfaction, Numeric Rating Scales for Back and Leg (NRS-B/L) pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and return to work. Clinical outcome data (ODI and NRS-B/L) were collected at 3, 12, 24 months and continued at a 24-month interval up to a maximum of 8 years postoperatively. Results. 81.25% of patients (n = 26) retained their instrumentation and reported minimal disability, mild pain, and satisfaction with their surgery and returned to work (mean = 6 months). Six patients required instrumentation removal due to prominence of the instrumentation or screw loosening, causing discomfort/pain. Instrumentation removal patients reported moderate back and leg pain until removal occurred; after removal, they reported minimal disability and mild pain. Neither instrumentation removal nor retention resulted in complications or further surgical intervention. Conclusions. PercStab without instrumentation removal provided high patient satisfaction, mild pain, and minimal disability and relieved the patient from the burden of finances and resources allocation of a second surgery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background/Purpose. Pars planitis (PP) is a chronic intermediate uveitis of undefined cause, although autoimmune etiology is strongly suggested. This study was undertaken to evaluate circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with PP. A better understanding of immune alterations in PP may contribute to the development of an appropriate biologic treatment approach. Material and Methods. In our case-control study, samples of peripheral blood from 15 patients with pars planitis and 17 healthy subjects were collected. The patients underwent a full ophthalmological evaluation including macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) and submacular choroid (with enhanced deep imaging) with the SD-OCT Spectralis system. By flow cytometry, we assessed lymphocyte subpopulations as follows: Th1 subset: CD3+CD8-IFN-γ+ and CCR4-CXCR3+IFN-γ+ cells, Th17 subset: CD3+CD8-IL-17+ and CCR4+CCR6+IL-17+ cells, T regulatory (Treg): CD4+CD25hiCD127- cells, T suppressor (Tsup): CD8+CD28-FOXP3+ cells, and B regulatory (Breg): CD19+CD24hiCD38hi cells. The results are presented as the median percentage of immune cells in comparison to those obtained from the healthy control group. Results. In patients, an increase in the population of Th17-secreting cells negatively correlated with the abundance of both IFN-γ-producing and T regulatory as well as suppressor cells, regarding all the phenotypes studied. Although a strong dependence of the PB Th1 cell compartment on the duration of the disease was observed, it was limited to the subgroup of patients with macular edema only. The frequency of B regulatory cells was unchanged compared to controls. Conclusions. In pars planitis, the alterations in lymphocyte cell distribution affect primarily the T cell repertoire. The imbalance in PB Th1/Th17/Treg cells creates proinflammatory conditions, strengthening the suggestion that the immune background may play a role in pars planitis pathogenesis. Also, circulating Th1 level may be of potential clinical relevance in terms of prediction of a more severe course of the disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Because of the unsatisfactory dust suppression efficiency, coal dust still threatens production safety and personnel health. In order to understand the influence of the chemical microstructures of the surfactant on the wetting ability and to facilitate the rapid selecting of surfactants with good wetting performances for specific coal dust, fatty acid methyl ester ethoxylate (FMEE), dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS-12), sodium fatty acid polyoxyethylene ether carboxylate (AEC), and dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) were selected in this paper to study the wetting ability of these four surfactants on the bituminous coal dust in Tongchuan, Shaanxi province of China. First, the main functional groups and carbon composition of the coal dust and surfactants were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. Second, the drop shape analysis system DSA100 was used to measure the equilibrium contact angle of the surfactant solution with a concentration of 0.06% on bituminous coal dust. The relationship between the chemical microstructures of surfactants and contact angles was analyzed, and the main influencing factors were obtained. The results showed that the contact angle of DDBAC on coal sample dust was the smallest. In addition, the contents of hydroxyl, aromatic ring carbon, unprotonated carbon, and bridged aromatic carbon in surfactants had significant linear correlations with wettability, and the increase of their contents would lead to the decrease of contact angle. According to the results of correlation analysis and curve fitting, the evaluation model of influencing factors on the wettability to bituminous coal dust was established.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The subjective visual vertical (SVV) measures the perception of a person’s spatial orientation relative to gravity. Weighted central integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs is essential for SVV perception. Without any visual references and minimal proprioceptive contribution, the static SVV reflects balance of the otolith organs. Normal aging is associated with bilateral and progressive decline in otolith organ function, but age-dependent effects on SVV are inconclusive. Studies on sensory reweighting for visual vertical and multisensory integration strategies reveal age-dependent differences, but most studies have included elderly participants in comparison to younger adults. The aim of this study was to compare young adults with older adults, an age group younger than the elderly. Methods. Thirty-three young and 28 older adults (50–65 years old) adjusted a tilted line accurately to their perceived vertical. The rod’s final position from true vertical was recorded as tilt error in degrees. For otolithic balance, visual vertical was recorded in the dark without any visual references. The rod and frame task (RFT) with tilted disorienting visual frames was used for creating visuovestibular conflict. We adopted Nyborg’s analysis method to derive the rod and frame effect (RFE) and trial-to-trial variability measures. Rod alignment times were also analyzed. Results. There was no age difference in signed tilts of SVV without visual reference. There was an age effect on RFE and on overall trial-to-trial variability of rod tilt, with older adults displaying larger frame effects and greater variability in rod tilts. Alignment times were longer in the tilted-frame conditions for both groups and in the older adults compared to their younger counterparts. The association between tilt accuracy and tilt precision was significant for older adults only during visuovestibular conflict, revealing an increase in RFE with an increase in tilt variability. Correlation of σSVV, which represents vestibular input precision, with RFE yielded exactly the same contribution of σSVV to the variance in RFE for both age groups. Conclusions. Older adults have balanced otolithic input in an upright position. Increased reliance on visual cues may begin at ages younger than what is considered elderly. Increased alignment times for older adults may create a broader time window for integration of relevant and irrelevant sensory information, thus enhancing their multisensory integration. In parallel with the elderly, older adults may differ from young adults in their integration of sensory cues for visual vertical perception.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To report long-term visual and anatomical outcomes in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with a treat-and-extend regimen (TER) of intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections in real-world settings. Methods. Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with nAMD treated with a TER of anti-VEGF intravitreal injections by a single retina specialist (GC). Patients with nAMD who had at least one year of follow-up were identified using an electronic database. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, and macular OCT were performed at each visit. Patients received a loading dose of three monthly intravitreal injections and then were treated according to a TER of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and/or aflibercept. The number of injections, BCVA, and central retinal thickness (CRT) were evaluated during the follow-up period. Results. 180 eyes from 180 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 75 ± 9 (range: 51–96). Mean BCVA was 0.77 ± 0.64 LogMAR at baseline, 0.69 ± 0.58 LogMAR (p=0.0057) after loading phase, 0.64 ± 0.55 LogMAR (p=0.0001) after 6 months of TER, and 0.76 ± 0.71 LogMAR after 6 years of treatment (n = 32 at year 6). CRT decreased significantly after the loading phase (p=0.0002). The mean number of intravitreal injections per year was 7.6 during the first three years of treatment and then decreased to 5.9 during year 4 to 7. Conclusions. This retrospective study of 180 nAMD patients treated with a TER of intravitreal anti-VEGF demonstrates an initial improvement of BCVA after loading phase, followed by long-term visual stabilization for at least six years. These results were obtained with a high number of injections, averaging close to six injections per year during long-term follow-up. In light of the natural evolution of nAMD, these data support the long-term efficacy of this treatment under real-world conditions of heterogeneity of patients and type of anti-VEGF used.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Context. About 15 million people worldwide suffer strokes each year and 5 million people are left with permanent disabilities which is due to the loss of local blood supply to the brain, resulting in a neurologic deficit. Panax notoginseng (Bruk.) F. H. Chen (Araliaceae) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine widely used in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Objective. This study investigated whether Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) extracted from Panax notoginseng (Bruk.) F. H. Chen played a neuroprotective role by affecting the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway in oxygen-glucose deprived (OGD) SH-SY5Y cells. Materials and Methods. Different groups of OGD SH-SY5Y cells were treated with varying doses of PNS, PNS + AG1478 (a specific inhibitor of EGFR), or AG1478 for 16 hours. CCK8, Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis analysis, and LDH release analysis were used to determine cell viability, apoptosis rate, and amounts of LDH. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to measure mRNA and proteins levels of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-PI3K/PI3K, and p-AKT/AKT in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to OGD. Results. PNS significantly enhanced cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and weakened cytotoxicity by inhibiting the release of LDH. The mRNA expression profiles of EGFR, PI3K, and AKT showed no difference between model and other groups. Additionally, ratios of p-EGFR, p-PI3K, and p-AKT to EGFR, PI3K, and AKT proteins expression, respectively, all increased significantly. Conclusions. These findings indicate that PNS enhanced neuroprotective effects by activating the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and elevating phosphorylation levels in OGD SH-SY5Y cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been reported to have strong anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. CAP has been known to induce apoptosis in most cancer cells by treatment to cells using direct and indirect treatment methods. There are many reports of apoptosis pathways induced by CAP, but for indirect treatment, there is still a lack of fundamental research on how CAP can cause apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we applied an indirect treatment method to determine how CAP can induce cancer cell death. First, plasma-activated medium (PAM) was produced by a 2.45 GHz microwave-excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet (ME-APPJ). Next, the amounts of various reactive species in the PAM were estimated using colorimetric methods. The concentration of NO2– and H2O2 in PAM cultured with cancer cells was measured, and intracellular reactive oxidative stress (ROS) changes were observed using flow cytometry. When PAM was incubated with A549 lung cancer cells, there was little change in NO2– concentration, but the concentration of H2O2 gradually decreased after 30 min. While the intracellular ROS of A549 cells was rapidly increased at 2 hours, there was no significant change in that of PAM-treated normal cells. Furthermore, PAM had a significant cytotoxic effect on A549 cells but had little effect on normal cell viability. In addition, using flow cytometry, we confirmed that apoptosis of A549 cells occurred following flow cytometry and western blot analysis. These results suggest that among various reactive species produced by PAM, hydrogen peroxide plays a key role in inducing cancer cell apoptosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper considers the influence of different carbon emission policies for liner shipping. The transportation optimization models under four different forms of carbon emission policies (no carbon emissions constraints, carbon emissions tax, carbon caps, and carbon cap-and-trade) are developed. A real case is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and comparative analysis of the impact of different carbon emission policies on shipowner’s profit and ship carbon emission. It is shown that the carbon caps form is the most direct method for reducing emission; the form of carbon emissions tax is a mandatory measure, which has the greatest impact on the profit of shipping companies; carbon cap-and-trade forms have weaker emission reduction effects, it is easier for enterprises to actively implement emission reductions and be highly motivated in the long run.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yingbin Chai</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yongou Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this work, the edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM) is incorporated with the Bathe time integration scheme to solve the transient wave propagation problems. The edge-based gradient smoothing technique (GST) can properly soften the “overly soft” system matrices from the standard finite element approach; then, the spatial numerical dispersion error of the calculated solutions for wave problems can be significantly reduced. To effectively solve the transient wave propagation problems, the Bathe time integration scheme is employed to perform the involved time integration. Due to the appropriate “numerical dissipation effects” from the Bathe time integration method, the spurious oscillations in the relatively large wave numbers (high frequencies) can be effectively suppressed; then, the temporal numerical dispersion error in the calculated solutions can also be notably controlled. A number of supporting numerical examples are considered to examine the capabilities of the present approach. The numerical results show that ES-FEM works very well with the Bathe time integration technique, and much more numerical solutions can be reached for solving transient wave propagation problems compared to the standard FEM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Platelet indices have been used to diagnose and prognosticate infections such as tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, and septic shock. Platelet indices have previously not been used in the prediction of multiorgan dysfunction (MODS) in patients with scrub typhus. A three-year retrospective review of patient charts was performed. Patients with and without MODS were compared. Platelet indices and other clinical and laboratory variables were used in logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors. A ROC curve was generated with the platelet indices to predict MODS. Of 189 patients, 106 were male. Respiratory rate, serum creatinine, liver function tests, platelet count, thrombocytopenia &lt;150 × 109/L, mean platelet volume (MPV) &gt; 7.3 fL, and plateletcrit ≤0.19% varied significantly between patients with MODS and those without. Platelet indices are inexpensive and easily available. Only thrombocytopenia along with creatinine, alanine transaminase, and abnormal chest radiograph could significantly predict MODS in patients with scrub typhus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the mining of the shallow-buried and close-distance multiple coal seam, the rheological failure of the surrounding weakly cemented soft rock of the roadway in the lower coal seam under the concentrated stress is very rare. However, the stress on the roof of the upper coal seam is transmitted down through the residual pillar, resulting in this situation. Taking the Gaojialiang coal mine which is located in the mining areas of western China as the research object, the failure mechanism of the roadway roof under the residual coal pillar in the shallow-buried and close-distance multiple seam is studied in combination with field monitoring and numerical simulation. Furthermore, suggestions on the roadway support under such geological conditions are proposed. The results show that the residual coal pillar in the working face of the lower coal seam gradually collapses during the mining of the shallow-buried and close-distance multiple coal seam. The concentrated stress transferred by the coal pillar increases further, which makes the roof stress of the lower coal seam roadway to increase continuously. In addition, the stress of the roadway roof also increases further due to the rotation of the broken rock above the goaf, and the peek region of stress moves to the nongoaf area. Combining the heavy concentrated stress and weakly cemented property, the shallow-buried surrounding rock shows rheological behavior and failure. Therefore, we must pay more attention on the creep failure of the roadway roof under the action of the residual coal pillar even in the shallow-buried coal seam.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inspissated bile syndrome is a rare cause of cholestatic jaundice in infancy, occurring due to obstruction of the biliary ducts and gallbladder by biliary sludge. Traditional methods of treatment include surgical drainage or cholecystostomy drain placement. Both can be associated with complications and prolonged admission. We present 2 cases treated with a single percutaneous needle puncture of the gallbladder followed by saline lavage. Two neonates presented with cholestatic jaundice and sonographic evidence of biliary sludge and dilation of the common bile duct. Single sonographic-guided needle puncture of the gallbladder was followed by irrigation with saline. Clearing of the biliary sludge was confirmed by sonography and cholecystocholangiography. There was resolution of the cholestatic jaundice, with no complications or repeat procedures.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yue Yan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The approach of multipoint measurement, with increasing hardware cost, should no longer be adopted against the problem of low detection precision on the quality and concentration measurement of large-caliber or irregular pipeline gas with the single platinum film probe. Alternatively, the data correction and improvement can be carried out through establishing an RBF model to detect sample gas after preprocessing. Furthermore, the computer simulation and error analysis can be implemented by taking actual SO2 data emitted by one medium-sized coal-fired power plant in China as a training sample. Hence, it can be shown that this approach on improvement and analysis of continuous monitoring of the systematic integrated error against the instrument correction and flue gas emission has feasibility, and the comprehensive average error is less than 0.6%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Although severe pneumonia and respiratory compromise have remained the predominant complications of coronavirus disease 19, we are now learning this virus is much more varied in its presentation. In particular, there are increasingly reported cases of thromboembolic events occurring in infected patients. Case Report. In this report, we present two patients, both under the age of 40 with known risk factors for venous thromboembolism, who presented with respiratory distress. Both patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and pulmonary embolism requiring management with anticoagulation. Both patients were discharged after a short course in the hospital. Conclusion. The discussion of a hypercoagulable state induced by coronavirus disease 19 has been well documented; however, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. We suspect that a prothrombotic inflammatory response provoked by coronavirus disease could be the culprit, acting as an additive effect on middle-aged patients with known risk factors for venous thromboembolism. We recommend clinicians closely monitor those with known risk factors for pulmonary embolism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), an important traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been used clinically for centuries for the treatment of various diseases. The study aims to explore the BYHWD effects on angiogenesis and neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury in rats and to explore the underlying angiogenic roles and mechanisms of BYHWD in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) model. Methods. The effects of BYHWD on neurological function were screened by measuring neurological deficits, spatial memory function, and angiogenesis (by microvascular density (MVD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF)) after CI/R injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo in rats. In vitro, we examined the angiogenic roles and mechanisms of action of BYHWD in an H2O2-induced oxidative stress HUVECs model by measuring cell viability, apoptosis, vascular tube formation, intracellular ROS generation, NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity, and Nox4 protein expression. Results. BYHWD significantly improved neurological function, including neurological deficits and spatial learning and memory, and significantly increased MVD and CBF in the ischemic penumbra after CI/R injury in rats. BYHWD significantly increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis, induced vascular tube formation, decreased intracellular ROS generation, and reduced Nox activity and Nox4 protein expression in H2O2-treated HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that BYHWD promotes neurological function recovery and increases angiogenesis. BYHWD exerts angiogenic effects against cerebral ischemic injury through the downregulation of Nox4, which results in the reduction of ROS generation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lumbar hernias are rare abdominal wall defects. Fewer than 400 cases have been reported in the literature and account for 2% of all abdominal wall hernias. Lumbar hernias are divided into Grynfelt-Lesshaft or Petit hernias. The former are hernia defects through the superior lumbar triangle, while the latter are defects of the inferior lumbar triangle. Primary lumbar hernias are further subdivided into congenital or acquired hernias and can further be classified as either primary or secondary. Secondary hernias occur after previous flank surgeries, iatrogenic muscular disruption, infection, or trauma. We review a rare presentation of metachronous symptomatic bilateral secondary acquired lumbar hernia following spine surgery. A successful laparoscopic transabdominal lumbar hernia repair with extraperitoneal mesh placement was performed, with resolution of the hernia symptoms. An extensive literature review regarding lumbar hernia and different types of repairs was performed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Play is considered the main occupation for children. Pediatric occupational therapists utilize play either for evaluation or intervention purpose. However, play is not properly measured by occupational therapists, and the use of play instrument is limited. This systematic review was aimed at identifying play instruments relevant to occupational therapy practice and its clinimetric properties. A systematic search was conducted on six databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection, Scopus, and ASEAN Citation Index) in January 2020. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using Law and MacDermid’s Appraisal for Clinical Measurement Research Reports, and psychometric properties of play instruments were evaluated using Terwee’s checklist while the clinical utility is extracted from each instrument. Initial search identifies 1,098 articles, and only 30 articles were included in the final analysis, extracting 8 play instruments. These instruments were predominantly practiced in the Western culture, which consists of several psychometric evidences. The Revised Knox Preschool Play Scale is considered the most extensive and comprehensive play instrument for extrinsic aspect, whereas the Test of Playfulness + Test of Environmental Supportiveness Unifying Measure is a promising play instrument for intrinsic aspect on play, where both instruments utilize observation. My Child’s Play is a potential questionnaire-based play instrument. However, the current development of play instruments in the occupational therapy field is immature and constantly evolving, and occupational therapists should exercise good clinical reasoning when selecting a play instrument to use in practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. To compare the biomechanical stability of the femur following the removal of proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA-II) and dynamic hip screw (DHS). Material and Methods. 56 paired cadaveric femurs were used as experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, PFNA-II and DHS were randomly inserted into femurs on both sides and then removed. Thereafter, compression load was applied until fracture occurred; biomechanical stability of the femurs and associated fracture patterns were studied. Results. The ultimate load and stiffness of the control group were 6227.8±1694.1 N and 990.5±99.8 N/mm, respectively. These were significantly higher than experimental group (p=0.014, &lt;0.001) following the removal of PFNA-II (4085.6±1628.03 N and 656.3±155.3 N/mm) and DHS (4001.9±1588.3 N and 656.3±155.3 N/mm). No statistical differences in these values were found between the 2 device groups (p=0.84, 0.71), regardless of age groups. However, fracture patterns were different between two devices, intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. Conclusions. Mechanical stability of the proximal femurs does not differ after the removal of 2 different of fixation devices regardless of the age. However, it was significantly lower compared to an intact femur. Different fracture patterns have been shown following the removal of different fixation devices as there are variations in the site of stress risers for individual implants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we focus on the existence of positive solutions for a class of weakly singular Hadamard-type fractional mixed periodic boundary value problems with a changing-sign singular perturbation. By using nonlinear analysis methods combining with some numerical techniques, we further discuss the effect of the perturbed term for the existence of solutions of the problem under the positive, negative, and changing-sign cases. The interesting points are that the nonlinearity can be singular at the second and third variables and be changing-sign.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate a comprehensive and reliable conclusion on the correlations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene with the risk of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods. We screened PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CISCOM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, CBM, and CNKI databases for those relevant studies that investigated  the association of 14,945 subjects with clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer. Results. Eleven case-control studies that met all inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 14,945 subjects were involved, including 3,049 DN patients and 11,896 DM patients. Our meta-analysis results revealed that VEGF rs2010963 and rs3025039 polymorphisms might contribute to the risk of DN in DM patients. Ethnicity-stratified analysis suggested that VEGF genetic polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of DN among Asians. However, we found no correlations of VEGF genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to DN among Caucasians. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that VEGF rs2010963 and rs3025039 polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of DN in DM patients, especially among Asians. Thus, VEGF genetic polymorphisms could be useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of DN in DM patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of technology, the hardware requirement and expectations of user for visual enjoyment are getting higher and higher. The multitype tree (MTT) architecture is proposed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET). Therefore, it is necessary to determine not only coding unit (CU) depth but also its split mode in the H.266/Versatile Video Coding (H.266/VVC). Although H.266/VVC achieves significant coding performance on the basis of H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (H.265/HEVC), it causes significantly coding complexity and increases coding time, where the most time-consuming part is traversal calculation rate-distortion (RD) of CU. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an adaptive CU split decision method based on deep learning and multifeature fusion. Firstly, we develop a texture classification model based on threshold to recognize complex and homogeneous CU. Secondly, if the complex CUs belong to edge CU, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure based on multifeature fusion is utilized to classify CU. Otherwise, an adaptive CNN structure is used to classify CUs. Finally, the division of CU is determined by the trained network and the parameters of CU. When the complex CUs are split, the above two CNN schemes can successfully process the training samples and terminate the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) calculation for some CUs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces the computational complexity and saves 39.39% encoding time, thereby achieving fast encoding in H.266/VVC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>31 natural gases in the western Qaidam Basin of China were collected and analyzed for gas composition including light hydrocarbons (C5-C7) and carbon isotopic characteristics. Based on genetic type obtained from C1-C3 and C7 fractions, four types of gases are identified: oil-type gas, coal-type gas, biodegraded gas, and mixed gas. The oil-type gas is the predominant-type gas in the western Qaidam Basin; coal-type gas is mainly distributed in the Zhahaquan and Nanyishan fields; mixed gas is mainly in the Zhahaquan, Wunan, and Nanyishan fields; and biodegraded gas is mainly distributed in the Huatugou and Yuejinerhao fields. According to the empirical relationship between δ13C1 and the equivalent vitrinite reflectance (Ro, %) of source rock, the Ro values of gas range from 0.6% to 1.5%, with an average value of 0.9%. The generation temperatures of major reservoired hydrocarbons (GTMRH) calculated from the C7 components range from 115.6°C to 141.7°C, with an average value of 126.5°C. These two maturity indicators have relatively positive correlation and reveal that the maturity of gas increases from west to east in the southwestern Qaidam Basin. Moreover, combining GTMRH with the homogenous temperature of petroleum inclusions, it is inferred that major petroleum charge in the western Qaidam Basin mainly occurred during the late period of the Himalayan movement. Deep hydrocarbon fluid sources were found in the Shizigou, Yingdong, Zhahaquan, and Nanyishan fields; thus, the deep reservoirs of paleouplifts adjacent to the hydrocarbon-generating depressions are estimated as a favorable area for further exploration in the western Qaidam Basin.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ding Guangtao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the theory and methods of analytical mechanics that can be effectively applied to the research of some nonlinear nonconservative systems through the case study of two-dimensionally coupled Mathews-Lakshmanan oscillator (abbreviated as M-L oscillator). (1) According to the inverse problem method of Lagrangian mechanics, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian function in the form of rectangular coordinates of the two-dimensional M-L oscillator is directly constructed from an integral of the two-dimensional M-L oscillators. (2) The Lagrange and Hamiltonian function in the form of polar coordinate was rewritten by using coordinate transformation. (3) By introducing the vector form variables, the two-dimensional M-L oscillator motion differential equation, the first integral, and the Lagrange function are written. Therefore, the two-dimensional M-L oscillator is directly extended to the three-dimensional case, and it is proved that the three-dimensional M-L oscillator can be reduced to the two-dimensional case. (4) The two direct integration methods were provided to solve the two-dimensional M-L oscillator by using polar coordinate Lagrangian and pointed out that the one-dimensional M-L oscillator is a special case of the two-dimensional M-L oscillator.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Qianyi Zhan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wei Hu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The automatic detection of epilepsy is essentially the classification of EEG signals of seizures and nonseizures, and its purpose is to distinguish the different characteristics of seizure brain electrical signals and normal brain electrical signals. In order to improve the effect of automatic detection, this study proposes a new classification method based on unsupervised multiview clustering results. In addition, considering the high-dimensional characteristics of the original data samples, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is introduced to extract the sample features to obtain deep features. The deep feature reduces the sample dimension and increases the sample separability. The main steps of our proposed novel EEG detection method contain the following three steps: first, a multiview FCM clustering algorithm is introduced, and the training samples are used to train the center and weight of each view. Then, the class center and weight of each view obtained by training are used to calculate the view-weighted membership value of the new prediction sample. Finally, the classification label of the new prediction sample is obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect seizures.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Chao Ming</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xiaoming Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper investigates the design problem of the attitude controller for air-breathing supersonic vehicle subject to uncertainties and disturbances. Firstly, the longitudinal model is established for the attitude controller design which is devised as a strict feedback formulation, and a transformed tracking error is derived with the prescribed performance control technique such that it can limit the tracking error to a predefined region. Then, a novel linear active disturbance rejection control scheme is proposed for the attitude system to enhance the steady-state and transient-state performances by incorporating the transformed tracking error. On the basis of the Lyapunov stability theorem, the convergence and stability characteristics are both rigorously proved for the closed-loop system. Finally, extensive contrast simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and advantage of the proposed control strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Standard cubature Kalman filter (CKF) algorithm has some disadvantages in stochastic system control, such as low control accuracy and poor robustness. This paper proposes a stochastic system control method based on adaptive correction CKF algorithm. Firstly, a nonlinear time-varying discrete stochastic system model with stochastic disturbances is constructed. The control model is established by using the CKF algorithm, the covariance matrix of standard CKF is optimized by square root filter, the adaptive correction of error covariance matrix is realized by adding memory factor to the filter, and the disturbance factors in nonlinear time-varying discrete stochastic systems are eliminated by multistep feedback predictive control strategy, so as to improve the robustness of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the state estimation accuracy of the proposed adaptive cubature Kalman filter algorithm is better than that of the standard cubature Kalman filter algorithm, and the proposed adaptive correction CKF algorithm has good control accuracy and robustness in the UAV control test.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>T. Saiki</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>A. Tatebayashi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We adopted a single-mode, single-wavelength volume holographic grating (VHG) wavelength-stabilized wavelength laser diode (LD) as a pumping LD for an end-pumped microchip Nd:YAG and Nd:YVO4 lasers we developed during CW and pulse operations. Higher optical-optical and slope efficiencies during CW operation have been obtained than when using a VHG LD experimentally. Output laser power is insensitive to the temperature of the LD when using a wavelength-stabilized LD and can remain stable and almost constant until the temperature of LD increases up to 40°C. The improved optical-optical conversion efficiency of 58% for the Nd:YVO4 laser has been obtained and calculated the output laser power during CW operation and compared it with the experimental results. We found that the output laser power of the Nd:YVO4 laser using the VHG wavelength-stabilized LD was more than twice as high as that using an LD without VHG. When the ambient temperature increases, the difference in output laser power should be large. In the future, a low-cost end-pumped microchip laser that does not require a temperature control should be developed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Low birth weight is defined as when a newborn weighs less than 2,500 grams within an hour of birth. Globally, it has been known that around 15.5% of newborns were below the normal level of weight at their birth and 95% of these infants lived in developing countries. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of low birth weight among newborns delivered at Butajira General Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods. An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was employed. All 196 paired study participants (newborn-mother) who were born on a one-month duration of the data collection period were included in the study. A pretested questionnaire was used to gather pertinent information about mother and newborn along with measuring newborn birth weight. Result. Majority of mothers 175 (92.1%) were aged between 20 and 34 years, and 186 (97.9%) were married. About 169 (88.9%) were protestant religion followers. This study showed that the magnitude of low birth weight among study participants was 12.5%, and factors such as maternal medical complication during pregnancy, maternal MUAC less than 23 cm, and birth interval less than 24 months were significantly associated with low birth. Conclusion. The study finding indicated that a significant number of newborns measured underweight which is below the normal level of weight at birth. The study identified factors such as maternal medical condition during pregnancy, maternal MUAC less than 23 cm, and birth interval less than 24 months. Based on study findings, we recommend health care officials, policymakers, key persons in the family, and volunteers to work on nutritional values particularly during pregnancy and before pregnancy. Spacing of birth is crucial to have healthy baby and healthy family even healthy society at large, so attention should be paid on family planning utilization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a robust adaptive output feedback control strategy based on a sliding mode super-twisting algorithm is designed for the trajectory tracking control of a wheeled mobile robot. First, a robust adaptive law is designed to eliminate the influence of parameter uncertainties. Second, a double-power sliding mode surface is designed to improve the response speed of the robot system. Finally, a high-gain observer is employed to estimate the speed information. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide, constituting one of the most significant causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive disorders, specifically gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, and preeclampsia, throughout pregnancy are contributors to the top causes of maternal mortality in the United States. Diagnosis of hypertensive disorders throughout pregnancy is challenging, with many disorders often remaining unrecognized or poorly managed during and after pregnancy. Moreover, the research has identified a strong link between the prevalence of maternal hypertensive disorders and racial and ethnic disparities. Factors that influence the prevalence of maternal hypertensive disorders among racially and ethnically diverse women include maternal age, level of education, United States-born status, nonmetropolitan residence, prepregnancy obesity, excess weight gain during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes. Examination of the factors that increase the risk for maternal hypertensive disorders along with the current interventions utilized to manage hypertensive disorders will assist in the identification of gaps in prevention and treatment strategies and implications for future practice. Specific focus will be placed on disparities among racially and ethnically diverse women that increase the risk for maternal hypertensive disorders. This review will serve to promote the development of interventions and strategies that better address and prevent hypertensive disorders throughout a pregnant woman’s continuum of care.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stress can cause a variety of central nervous system disorders, which are critically mediated by the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in various brain structures. GABAergic neurons have different subsets, some of which coexpress certain neuropeptides that can be found in the digestive system. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the gut-brain axis, which is primarily regulated by the vagus nerve, is involved in stress, suggesting a communication between the “gut-vagus-brain” pathway and the GABAergic neuronal system. Here, we first summarize the evidence that the GABAergic system plays an essential role in stress responses. In addition, we review the effects of stress on different brain regions and GABAergic neuron subpopulations, including somatostatin, parvalbumin, ionotropic serotonin receptor 5-HT3a, cholecystokinin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, with regard to signaling events, behavioral changes, and pathobiology of neuropsychiatric diseases. Finally, we discuss the gut-brain bidirectional communications and the connection of the GABAergic system and the gut-vagus-brain pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. As a multifaceted disease, atherosclerosis is often characterized by the formation and accumulation of plaque anchored to the inner wall of the arteries and causes some cardiovascular diseases and vascular embolism. Numerous studies have reported on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, fewer studies focused on both genes and immune cells, and the correlation of genes and immune cells was evaluated via comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. Methods. 29 samples of atherosclerosis-related gene expression profiling, including 16 human advanced atherosclerosis plaque (AA) and 13 human early atherosclerosis plaque (EA) samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, were analyzed to get differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the construction of protein and protein interaction (PPI) networks. Besides, we detected the relative fraction of 22 immune cell types in atherosclerosis by using the deconvolution algorithm of “cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT).” Ultimately, based on the significantly changed types of immune cells, we executed the correlation analysis between DEGs and immune cells to discover the potential genes and pathways associated with immune cells. Results. We identified 17 module genes and 6 types of significantly changed immune cells. Correlation analysis showed that the relative percentage of T cell CD8 has negative correlation with the C1QB expression (R=−0.63, p=0.02), and the relative percentage of macrophage M2 has positive correlation with the CD86 expression (R=0.57, p=0.041) in EA. Meanwhile, four gene expressions (CD53, C1QC, NCF2, and ITGAM) have a high correlation with the percentages of T cell CD8 and macrophages (M0 and M2) in AA samples. Conclusions. In this study, we suggested that the progression of atherosclerosis might be related to CD86, C1QB, CD53, C1QC, NCF2, and ITGAM and that it plays a role in regulating immune-competent cells such as T cell CD8 and macrophages M0 and M2. These results will enable studies of the potential genes associated with immune cells in the progression of atherosclerosis, as well as provide insight for discovering new treatments and drugs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Posterior transfacet approach has been proved to be a safe and effective access to treat thoracic disc herniation. However, the influencing factors of posterior modified transarticular debridement for thoracic tuberculosis have not been reported in the clinical literature. From 2009 to 2014, 37 patients with TST underwent a posterior modified transfacet debridement, interbody fusion following posterior instrumentation, under the cover of 18 months of antituberculosis chemotherapy. The patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively in terms of Frankel Grade, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, kyphotic Cobb angle, and bone fusion. Blood loss (positive correlation) and focal debridement (positive correlation) could affect operative time. Operative time (positive correlation) could affect blood loss. While, age (positive correlation), PostE (negative correlation), and T_FocalDebridement (positive correlation) could affect bone fusion. The accuracy of naive bayes classifier model is 86.11%. Our preliminary results show that blood loss and focal debridement could affect operative time; operative time could affect blood loss; age, PostE, and T_FocalDebridement could affect bone fusion; the naive Bayes classifier model can predict the KirkaldyWillis accurately.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although significant advances have been made recently in the field of face recognition, these have some limitations, especially when faces are in different poses or have different levels of illumination, or when the face is blurred. In this study, we present a system that can directly identify an individual under all conditions by extracting the most important features and using them to identify a person. Our method uses a deep convolutional network that is trained to extract the most important features. A filter is then used to select the most significant of these features by finding features greater than zero, storing their indices, and comparing the features of other identities with the same indices as the original image. Finally, the selected features of each identity in the dataset are subtracted from features of the original image to find the minimum number that refers to that identity. This method gives good results, as we only extract the most important features using the filter to recognize the face in different poses. We achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only half of the 128 bytes per face. The system has an accuracy of 99.7% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset and 94.02% on YouTube Faces DB.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effective radius of methane extraction after high-pressure water jet slotting is the most important parameter for borehole optimization and extraction time planning. We applied a steady flow model and thermal-hydrological-mechanical (THM) coupling model to calculate the effective radius after high-pressure water jet slotting. Field measurements at the Zhongliangshan coal mine show that both the steady flow model and the THM coupling model can accurately represent the effective radius, and the THM coupling model provides further information regarding extraction time. After that, a variety of factors, including extraction time, coal burial depth, slot radius, initial permeability, and initial methane pressure, are discussed. The effective radius of a slotted borehole is 1.94 times larger than that of a conventional borehole.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study details the design and characterization of a new, biodegradable, and renewable whey/cellulose-based hydrogel (i.e., agricultural hydrogel). This was formulated from cellulose derivatives (carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)) and acid whey cross-linked with citric acid, with the aim to obtain an agricultural product with a high swelling capacity to uphold the quality of soil and conserve water resources. With regard to the swelling behaviour of the prepared hydrogels, the authors initially assessed the swelling ratio and capacity for water uptake. Evaluating the chemical structure of the hydrogel and its thermal and viscoelastic properties involved performing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning colorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, and rheological measurement of the hydrogel films. According to preliminary results, sufficient swelling capacity and stiffness were observed in a hydrogel prepared with 3% CMC and HEC, cross-linked with 5% citric acid. Moreover, the kinetics of water uptake revealed a promising capacity that was sustainable after 5 drying and swelling cycles. The results confirmed that the stability of the hydrogel was enhanced by the presence of the citric acid. As a consequence, it is necessary to utilize an appropriate cross-linking concentration and abide by certain conditions to ensure the swelling properties of the prepared hydrogel are sufficient. Further investigation of the topic, especially in relation to applications in soil, could confirm if the whey-cellulose-based hydrogel is actually suitable for agricultural use, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable arable farming.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease. Unvaccinated pregnant women are not only at risk of infection but also at risk of severe pregnancy complications. As measles causes a dysregulation of the entire immune system, we describe immunological variations and how immune response mechanisms can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We evaluated data during the measles outbreak reported in the province of Catania, Italy, from May 2017 to June 2018. We controlled hospital discharge records for patients admitted to hospital obstetric wards searching the measles diagnostic code. We have indicated the case as “confirmed” when the IgM was found to be positive with the ELISA method. We registered 843 cases of measles and 51% were females (430 cases). 24 patients between the ages of 17 and 40 had measles while they were pregnant. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included 2 spontaneous abortions, 1 therapeutic abortion, 1 foetal death, and 6 preterm deliveries. Respiratory complications were more prevalent in pregnant women (21%) than in nonpregnant women with measles (9%). 14 health care workers (1.7%) were infected with measles, and none of these had been previously vaccinated. Immune response mechanisms were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with measles. To reduce the rate of measles complications, gynaecologists should investigate vaccination history and antibody test results in all women of childbearing age. During a measles outbreak, gynaecologists and midwives should be active proponents of vaccination administration and counteract any vaccine hesitancy not only in patients but also among health care workers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. American cockroaches contaminated with pathogens inside hospital manholes can be one of the major problems that health care systems face. Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the fungal infections of American cockroaches in the Esfahan hospital sewage network. The principle goal of the study was about the roaches as a vector of fungi and other pathogens. Method. The type of study was descriptive-analytical. A total of 55 American cockroach specimens from the manhole walls of the sewerage system of 7 large hospitals were captured. Samples were taken from the surface of the body, digestive tract, and haemocoel of cockroaches. The specimens were then cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar separately, and fungi were identified according to the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Results. All cockroaches collected from hospitals were infected with fungi. Among the 24 (13 infected and 11 noninfected) (44%) female cockroaches and 31 (18 infected and 13 noninfected) (56%) male cockroaches, it was identified that 40.00% was infected with Aspergillus niger, 3.64% with Rhizopus, 7.27% with Penicillium, and 5.45% with Mucor. 6 cockroaches had no yeast contamination. 17 (30.91%) cockroaches were contaminated with Candida glabrata, 23 (41.82%) cockroaches were contaminated with Candida krusei, and 22 (40%) cockroaches were contaminated with other yeast species. The results of this study showed that Candida krusei had the highest prevalence among the isolated fungi with 35.37% of the digestive system and Aspergillus niger with 70.97% of the surface of the cockroach body. Conclusion. The results emphasized the role played by cockroaches as potential pathogenic vectors in hospital environments. Therefore, suitable management is needed for controlling this insect to prevent disease transmission in hospitals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Low-frequency oscillations in power systems can be modeled as an exponentially damped sinusoid (EDS) signal. Its frequency, damping factor, and amplitude are identified by the robust algorithm proposed in this paper. Under the condition of no noise, the exponentially convergent property of the proposed identification is proved by the use of time scale change, variable transformation, slow integral manifold, averaging method, and Lyapunov stability theorem in sequence. Under the condition of bounded additive noise, the antinoise performance of the identification of each parameter is investigated by the perturbed system theorem and error synthesis principle. The robustness of the proposed method is embodied in the following aspects: the exponential convergence for EDS signal with a wide range of frequency, especially with a rather low frequency; the boundary values of identification errors resulting from high-frequency sinusoidal noise of both frequency and damping factor can be adjusted by tuning the design parameters; and the different effects of the four design parameters on tracking performance and antinoise performance of each parameter identification. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and validate the conclusions.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Alexis Richard C. Claridades</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jiyeong Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Focus on indoor spatial applications has been rising with the growing interest in indoor spaces. Along with the widespread use of mobile devices and the internet, it has increased demands for indoor location-based services (LBS), demanding more efficient representation and management of indoor spatial data. Indoor points of interest (Indoor POI) data, representing both spaces and facilities located indoors, provide the infrastructure for these services. These datasets are vital in delivering timely and accurate information to users, such as in cases of managing indoor facilities. However, even though there are studies that explore its use across applications and efforts exerted towards the standardization of the data model, most POI development studies have focused on the outdoors and remain underdeveloped in the indoors. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal Indoor POI data model to provide direction for the establishment of indoor POI data and to address limitations in currently available data specifications. By exploring how different Indoor POIs are from its outdoor counterparts, particularly on extending its outdoor counterparts’ functions on searching, sharing, and labeling, we describe the data model and its components using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). We perform an SQL-based query experiment to demonstrate the potential use of the data model using sample data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to make an accurate prediction of vehicle trajectory in a dynamic environment, a Unidirectional and Bidirectional LSTM (UB-LSTM) vehicle trajectory prediction model combined with behavior recognition is proposed, and then an acceleration trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the interactive information with the surrounding vehicles is obtained by calculation, then the vehicle behavior recognition model is established by using LSTM, and the vehicle information is input into the behavior recognition model to identify vehicle behavior. Then, the trajectory prediction model is established based on Unidirectional and Bidirectional LSTM, and the identified vehicle behavior and the input information of the behavior recognition model are input into the trajectory prediction model to predict the horizontal and vertical speed and coordinates of the vehicle in the next 3 seconds. Experiments are carried out with NGSIM data sets, and the experimental results show that the mean square error (MSE) between the predicted trajectory and the actual trajectory obtained by this method is 0.124, which is 97.2% lower than that of the method that does not consider vehicle behavior and directly predicts the trajectory. The test loss is 0.000497, which is 95.68% lower than that without considering vehicle behavior. The predicted trajectory is obviously optimized, closer to the actual trajectory, and the performance is more stable.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yong Jiang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In a fog computing environment, lots of devices need to be authenticated in order to keep the platform being secured. To solve this problem, we turn to blockchain techniques. Unlike the identification cryptographic scheme based on elliptic curves, the proposed 2-adic ring identity authentication scheme inherits the high verification efficiency and high key distribution of sequence ciphers of 2-adic ring theory, and this algorithm adds identity hiding function and trading node supervision function by design. The main designed application scenario of this solution is applicable to the consortium blockchain, and the master nodes are mutually trusting cooperative relations. The node transaction verification and block generation consensus algorithm designed in this solution can be implemented in a set of algorithms, which has higher verification efficiency and easier to be deployed than other solutions. This scheme can be widely used in the fog computing environment.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Mahdi Jemmali</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper proposes an optimization system for solving an NP-hard problem by using several new algorithms and application programs. This study aims to identify a suitable distribution of investment projects across several developed industrial regions. It is assumed that all industrial regions involved have the same economic and strategic characteristics. The problem involves a set of projects that are to be assigned across regions. Each project creates an estimated number of new jobs, and the distribution of projects can be guided by minimizing the maximum total number of newly created jobs. The problem is NP-hard one, and it is difficult to determine the most appropriate distribution. We apply scheduling algorithms in order to solve the analyzed problem. Severalheuristics are developedto obtain the appropriate distribution of newly created jobs across all regions. A branch-and-bound method is employed in order to obtain the exact solution. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by the experimental results for a total number of 1850 instances.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xinming Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The optimization problem of drug release based on the multilaminated drug-controlled release devices has been solved in this paper under the inverse problem solution scheme. From the viewpoint of inverse problem, the solution of optimization problem can be regarded as the solution problem of a Fredholm integral equation of first kind. The solution of the Fredholm integral equation of first kind is a well-known ill-posed problem. In order to solve the severe ill-posedness, a modified regularization method is presented based on the Tikhonov regularization method and the truncated singular value decomposition method. The convergence analysis of the modified regularization method is also given. The optimization results of the initial drug concentration distribution obtained by the modified regularization method demonstrate that the inverse problem solution scheme proposed in this paper has the advantages of the numerical accuracy and antinoise property.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the core equipment of the power generation system, a gas turbine is an indispensable energy-converting device in the national industry. The flow inside a high-pressure turbine (HPT) is highly unsteady, which has a great influence on the aerothermal performance and structural strength. To better clarify the flow mechanism and guide the advanced design, the basic flow characteristics of transonic turbines are investigated in the paper by a modified scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) model based on the shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The numerical results reveal the formation and development of the secondary flow structures such as wake vortex, pressure wave, shock wave, and the interactions among them. The length and frequency characteristics of wake are in good agreement with the large eddy simulation (LES) and the experimental data. Based on the detailed flow information, the local loss analysis is performed using the entropy generation rate. In summary, the wake vortex-related flow is the main origin of unsteadiness and entropy loss in high-pressure turbine cascade.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Static stability margin is a critical parameter in flight control design. The feasible range of it must cover the uncertainty through the flight. To reasonably identify the feasible range of static stability margin in advance, an approach based on guardian maps is proposed for flight control of hypersonic flight vehicles with input saturation. First, the model of hypersonic flight vehicle (HFV) is established as a parametric plant. Then, flying quality requirements for the closed-loop system are formulated as inequality constraints using guardian maps. Moreover, by using linear matrix inequality, the saturation of elevators is taken into account in the integrated control of attitude control. The prescribed minimum of static stability margin that ensures the flying quality of hypersonic flight vehicles with input saturation is obtained. Furthermore, from the prospective of integrated control, it is shown that the feasible range of static stability margin can be enlarged by changing aerodynamic characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by numerical simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Tsegaye Mehare</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yewbmirt Sharew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction. Birth weight has emerged as the pointer of infant wellbeing and the fundamental focus of infant health policy. Low birth weight predisposes newborns to loads of health disarray like underweight, stunting, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, mental retardation, physical, and neurodevelopment problems which results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of low birth weights in term newborns. Objective. This study designed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of low birth weight among term newborns in Dilla town, Southern Ethiopia. Materials and Methods. Institutional based cross-sectional study design was used on 472 term newborns. The study setting includes three health centers (Dilla, Wallemi, and Tumetecha) within Dilla town and Dilla University referral hospital from September 1, 2018, to January 30, 2019. The study subjects were mothers with term newborns delivered in the above institutions and those delivered at home and received care within the first 24 hours after delivery in the above health care settings. Results. A total of 161 (34.1%) of the term newborns were low birth weight. Divorced mothers, rural residents, maternal age &lt;20 years old, unwanted and unintended pregnancy, no ANC follow-up, no dietary counsel, no foliate supplementation, and cigarette smoking have shown an association with low birth weight of neonates. Conclusions. Even though the method of sampling used in this study has its confines, the prevalence of low birth weight in this study was higher than the estimate in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is recommended that special attention should be given to pregnant mothers to get adequate rest, additional diet, and antenatal services available and accessible to all pregnant women.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jiying Ma</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Qing Yi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, by introducing environmental perturbation, we extend an epidemic model with graded cure, relapse, and nonlinear incidence rate from a deterministic framework to a stochastic differential one. The existence and uniqueness of positive solution for the stochastic system is verified. Using the Lyapunov function method, we estimate the distance between stochastic solutions and the corresponding deterministic system in the time mean sense. Under some acceptable conditions, the solution of the stochastic system oscillates in the vicinity of the disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproductive number R0≤1, while the random solution oscillates near the endemic equilibrium, and the system has a unique stationary distribution if R0&gt;1. Moreover, numerical simulation is conducted to support our theoretical results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) recovery path planning method of a known starting vector and end vector is studied. The local structure diagram is designed depending on the distance and orientation information about the obstacles. According to the local structure diagram, a Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) method with feedback is used to generate a 3D Dubins path that approaches the target area gradually, and the environmental characteristic of UUV reaching a specific target area is discussed. The simulation results demonstrate that this method can effectively reduce the calculation time and the amount of data storage required for planning. Meanwhile, the smooth spatial path generated can be used further to improve the feasibility of the practical application of UUV.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Electrochemical determination of dopamine (DA) in the presence of a large excess of ascorbic acid (AA) in their coexistence at a nickel oxide nanoparticle-modified preoxidized glassy carbon electrode (GCox/nano-NiOx) is achieved. The GCox/nano-NiOx electrode is prepared by electrodeposition of nickel nanoparticles (nano-Ni) onto an electrochemically activated glassy carbon (GC) electrode, and the thus prepared nano-Ni were subjected to electrochemical oxidation in alkaline medium for the formation of nickel oxide (NiOx). Modified electrodes were electrochemically and morphologically characterized. The effect of loading level of nickel was investigated by changing the number of potential cycles for the deposition of nano-Ni, i.e., 1, 2, 5, and 10 potential cycles, in the potential range from 0 to -1.0 V vs. SCE. Also, the experimental and instrumental parameters were optimized. Experimental results showed that the modified electrode differentiates well the oxidation peaks of DA and AA enabling the electrochemical determination of DA in the presence of a large excess of AA. Remarkably, it is found that the oxidation current of DA is 2 times larger than that of AA even the concentration of AA is about 5 times larger than that of DA. The LOD and LOQ of DA were calculated and were found to equal 0.69 and 2.3 mM, respectively. This offers the advantage of simple and selective detection of DA free of the interference of AA in real samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of intelligent vehicle technology, the demand for advanced driver assistant systems kept increasing. To improve the performance of the active safety systems, we focused on right-turning vehicle’s collision warning and avoidance. We put forward an algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the collision probability between the right-turning vehicle and another vehicle (or pedestrian) in intersections. We drew collision probability curves which used time-to-collision as the horizontal axis and collision probability as the vertical axis. We established a three-level collision warning system and used software to calculate and simulate the collision probability and warning process. To avoid the collision actively when turning right, a two-stage braking strategy is applied. Taking four right-turning collision conditions as examples, the two-stage braking strategy was applied, analysing and comparing the anteroposterior curve diagram simultaneously to avoid collision actively and reduce collision probability. By comparison, the collision probability 2 s before active collision avoidance was more than 80% and the collision probability may even reach 100% in certain conditions. To improve the active safety performance, the two-stage braking strategy can reduce the collision probability from exceeding 50% to approaching 0% in 2 s and reduce collision probability to less than 5% in 3 s. By changing four initial positions, the collision probability curve calculation algorithm and the two-stage braking strategy are validated and analysed. The results verified the rationality of the collision probability curve calculation algorithm and the two-stage braking strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the field of satellite data broadcasting, the management quality of data broadcasting bandwidth is directly related to the throughput of the broadcasting system and plays an important role in the performance of satellites. In this paper, for the sun-synchronous orbit meteorological satellite broadcasting which has the conventional product files and emergency information, a broadcast bandwidth statistical multiplexing and control method is designed for bandwidth management. It can be used for the management of broadcasting between regular products and emergency information, as well as internal broadcasting among regular products. This paper is the first to apply common multiplexing of PID and channel mode (CMPCM) to satellite broadcasting. The test verified that the broadcast channel of the parameters and the broadcast schedule management channel resources achieved statistical multiplexing of bandwidth, ratio of channel management functions, and data broadcast control. Broadcasting occupation ratio (BOR) and broadcasting file error ratio (BER) improved significantly. This is significant for improving the efficiency of satellite uplink broadcasting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerged into a promising research trend within the recurrent year where current and future networks are to use enhanced connectivity in these digital immigrations in different fields like medical, communication, and search and rescue operations among others. The current technologies are using fixed base stations to operate onsite and off-site in the fixed position with its associated problems like poor connectivity. This open gate for the UAV technology is to be used as a mobile alternative to increase accessibility with fifth-generation (5G) connectivity that focuses on increased availability and connectivity. There has been less usage of wireless technologies in the medical field. This paper first presents a study on deep learning to medical field application in general and provides detailed steps that are involved in the multiarmed bandit (MAB) approach in solving the UAV biomedical engineering technology device and medical exploration to exploitation dilemma. The paper further presents a detailed description of the bandit network applicability to achieve close optimal performance and efficiency of medical engineered devices. The simulated results depicted that a multiarmed bandit problem approach can be applied in optimizing the performance of any medical networked device issue compared to the Thompson sampling, Bayesian algorithm, and ε-greedy algorithm. The results obtained further illustrated the optimized utilization of biomedical engineering technology systems achieving thus close optimal performance on the average period through deep learning of realistic medical situations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gel-based electrodes are employed to record sEMG signals for prolonged periods. These signals are used for the control of myoelectric prostheses, clinical analysis, or sports medicine. However, when the gel dries, the electrode-skin impedance increases considerably. Using dry active electrodes (AEs) to compensate variations of impedance is an alternative for long-term recording. This work describes the optimization of the electronic design of a conventional AE by removing the impedance coupling stage and two filters. The proposed work consisted of 5 stages: electrodes, amplification (X250), 2.2 Vdc offset, low-pass filter, and ADC with USART communication. The device did not need the use of electrolytic gel. The measurements of CMRR (96 dB), amplitude of the output sEMG signal (∼1.6 Vp-p), and system bandwidth (15–450 Hz) were performed in order to confirm the reliability of the device as an sEMG signal acquisition system. The SNR values from seven movements performed by eleven volunteers were compared in order to measure the repeatability of the measurements (average 30.32 dB for a wrist flexion). The SNR for wrist flexion measured with the proposed and the commercial system was compared; the values were 49 dB and 60 dB, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stress is categorized as a condition of mental strain or pressure approaches because of upsetting or requesting conditions. There are various sources of stress initiation. Researchers consider human cerebrum as the primary wellspring of stress. To study how each individual encounters stress in different forms, researchers conduct surveys and monitor it. The paper presents the fusion of 5 algorithms to enhance the accuracy for detection of mental stress using EEG signals. The Whale Optimization Algorithm has been modified to select the optimal kernel in the SVM classifier for stress detection. An integrated set of algorithms (NLM, DCT, and MBPSO) has been used for preprocessing, feature extraction, and selection. The proposed algorithm has been tested on EEG signals collected from 14 subjects to identify the stress level. The proposed approach was validated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with values of 96.36%, 96.84%, 90.8%, and 97.96% and was found to be better than the existing ones. The algorithm may be useful to psychiatrists and health consultants for diagnosing the stress level.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Anaemia in pregnancy is a major problem in both developed and developing countries. The commonest source of anaemia is nutritional deficiency of iron with evidence suggesting that up to 90% of maternal anaemia may be due to inadequate consumption of dietary iron; however, there are other causes which include worm infestation, HIV infection, and genetic disorders. There are some implemented approaches in Ghana including education and awareness creation, nutritional supplements, and control and prevention of parasitic infections among others to prevent and control anaemia in pregnancy. This study assessed pregnant women adherence to Ghana’s anaemia prevention strategies being implemented in the Juaboso District. Method. A descriptive cross-sectional data on knowledge of and adherence to anaemia prevention strategies among pregnant women was collected. Pearson’s chi-square and logistic regression models were used to assessed associations between predictor and outcome variables. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Findings. About 13.5% of the pregnant women had high knowledge on anaemia, while 58.4% and 28.1% had moderate and low knowledge, respectively. Less than half (39.1%) of the women adhered to anaemia prevention strategies. There were significant associations between knowledge of anaemia and where pregnant woman resides in the district (AOR: 2.04, 95% CI: 2.16-9.83, p=0.003), woman’s educational (AOR: 10.43, 95% CI: 6.14-51.63, p=0.002), and occupational status (AOR: 15.14, 95% CI: 13.57-18.43, p&lt;0.001). Again, there were significant associations between adherence to anaemia prevention strategies and the woman’s ethnicity (AOR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.04-0.92, p=0.001) and her knowledge of anaemia (AOR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.32-7.93, p=0.001). Conclusions. Pregnant women’s knowledge of anaemia and adherence to anaemia prevention strategies are not encouraging. However, anaemia in pregnancy and its consequences could be devastating to all stakeholders if actions are not taken to reduce the phenomenon. Therefore, we recommend that more education and sensitisation programs including good nutritional practices in the diet of pregnant women be promoted to increase awareness and adherence to anaemia prevention strategies among pregnant women in the Juaboso District.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this research work, we propose a method for human action recognition based on the combination of structural and temporal features. The pose sequence in the video is considered to identify the action type. The structural variation features are obtained by detecting the angle made between the joints during the action, where the angle binning is performed using multiple thresholds. The displacement vector of joint locations is used to compute the temporal features. The structural variation features and the temporal variation features are fused using a neural network to perform action classification. We conducted the experiments on different categories of datasets, namely, KTH, UTKinect, and MSR Action3D datasets. The experimental results exhibit the superiority of the proposed method over some of the existing state-of-the-art techniques.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Information on combining ability and reciprocal effects (REC) facilitates efficient utilization of genetic materials in a breeding program. This study was conducted (at the CSIR-Savanna Agricultural Research Institute, Ghana) to determine general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA), heritability, genetic advance, GCA, and SCA effects as well as the relationship between parents per se performance and progenies for yield components and maturity traits in cowpea. The test populations were derived using a 5 × 5 complete diallel cross of parents with different yield attributes and maturity durations. The results indicated that GCA was predominant for number of days to 90% pod maturity, plant height at maturity, and hundred-seed weight. This showed that genes with additive effects conditioned these traits. Padi-Tuya, Songotra, and IT86D-610 were identified as good general combiners for grain yield, while Sanzi-Nya was identified as a general combiner for developing extra-early duration cowpea varieties. Crosses Songotra × Sanzi-Nya, SARC-1-57-2 × IT86D-610, Songotra × SARC-1-57-2, and Padi-Tuya × Songotra were identified as good specific combiners for days to 50% flowering, pod length, pods per plant, pod yield, grain yield, and seeds per pod. The findings from this study provide useful information on the inheritance of early maturity and yield traits in cowpea. This can be exploited to develop high yielding and early maturing cowpea varieties as climate smart strategy to mitigate climate change via breeding methods such as pedigree selection and marker assisted backcrossing (MABC). Pedigree selection method is being used to develop varieties from the hybrid with high and significant SCA for grain yield, whereas the development of extra-early duration varieties via MABC with Sanzi-Nya (general combiner for earliness traits) as a donor parent is ongoing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. According to the WHO, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. About 50% of the world’s glaucoma cases come from the Asian population, and in Malaysia itself, the prevalence of glaucoma is increasing. However, glaucoma is still a foreign word to our community despite the high prevalence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine the awareness of glaucoma among the community and its associated factors. Results. This study showed that only 25.2% of our respondents were aware of glaucoma and it is associated with ethnicity, religion, education, and household income. Besides, among those who were aware, they fall into the group of poor knowledge of glaucoma. On the other hand, the knowledge of glaucoma was associated with occupation and the awareness of glaucoma by definition. The validated questionnaire was distributed and the data were analyzed by SPSS software using t-test, one-way ANOVA, and chi-square test. Conclusion. Awareness and knowledge of glaucoma in this population is low. These findings suggest that there is a need for an efficient information and education strategy to be designed and conducted to increase the awareness and knowledge of glaucoma so that early detection can be made and effective management of individuals with this condition can be delivered.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the interaction and external interference, the crowds will constantly and dynamically adjust their evacuation path in the evacuation process to achieve the purpose of rapid evacuation. The information from previous process can be used to modify the current evacuation control information to achieve a better evacuation effect, and iterative learning control can achieve an effective prediction of the expected path within a limited running time. In order to depict this process, the social force model is improved based on an iterative extended state observer so that the crowds can move along the optimal evacuation path. First, the objective function of the optimal evacuation path is established in the improved model, and an iterative extended state observer is designed to get the estimated value. Second, the above model is verified through simulation experiments. The results show that, as the number of iterations increases, the evacuation time shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Wen Xu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>JiaJun Li</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The time-dependent vehicle routing problems have lately received great attention for logistics companies due to their crucial roles in reducing the time and economic costs, as well as fuel consumption and carbon emissions. However, the dynamic routing environment and traffic congestions have made it challenging to make the actual travelling trajectory optimal during the delivery process. To overcome this challenge, this study proposed an unconventional path optimization approach, fissile ripple spreading algorithm (FRSA), which is based on the advanced structure of coevolutionary path optimization (CEPO). The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the travelling time and path length of the vehicle, which are the popular indicators in path optimization. Some significant factors usually ignored in other research are considered in this study, such as congestion evolution, routing environment dynamics, signal control, and the complicated correlation between delivery sequence and the shortest path. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated well in two sets of simulated experiments. The results prove that the proposed FRSA can scientifically find out the optimal delivery trajectory in a single run via global research, effectively avoid traffic congestion, and decrease the total delivery costs. This finding paves a new way to explore a promising methodology for addressing the delivery sequence and the shortest path problems at the same time. This study can provide theoretical support for the practical application in logistics delivery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Information is exploding on the web at exponential pace, so online movie review is becoming a substantial information resource for online users. However, users post millions of movie reviews on regular basis, and it is not possible for users to summarize the reviews. Movie review classification and summarization is one of the challenging tasks in natural language processing. Therefore, an automatic approach is demanded to summarize the vast amount of movie reviews, and it will allow the users to speedily distinguish the positive and negative aspects of a movie. This study has proposed an approach for movie review classification and summarization. For movie review classification, bag-of-words feature extraction technique is used to extract unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as a feature set from given review documents, and represent the review documents as a vector space model. Next, the Naïve Bayes algorithm is employed to classify the movie reviews (represented as a feature vector) into positive and negative reviews. For the task of movie review summarization, Word2vec feature extraction technique is used to extract features from classified movie review sentences, and then semantic clustering technique is used to cluster semantically related review sentences. Different text features are used to calculate the salience score of each review sentence in clusters. Finally, the top-ranked sentences are chosen based on highest salience scores to produce the extractive summary of movie reviews. Experimental results reveal that the proposed machine learning approach is superior than other state-of-the-art approaches.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the current article, we study the kite four-body problems with the goal of identifying global regions in the mass parameter space which admits a corresponding central configuration of the four masses. We consider two different types of symmetrical configurations. In each of the two cases, the existence of a continuous family of central configurations for positive masses is shown. We address the dynamical aspect of periodic solutions in the settings considered and show that the minimizers of the classical action functional restricted to the homographic solutions are the Keplerian elliptical solutions. Finally, we provide numerical explorations via Poincaré cross-sections, to show the existence of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions within the broader dynamical context of the four-body problem.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the complexity of the underwater environment, underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) has always been challenging. Although deep neural networks (DNN) have been used in UATR and some achievements have been made, the performance is not satisfactory when recognizing underwater targets with different Doppler shifts, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and interferences. In the paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) was proposed to recognize the line spectrums of Detection of Envelope Modulation on Noise (DEMON) spectrums of underwater target-radiated noise. Datasets of targets with different Doppler shifts, SNRs, and interferences were designed to evaluate the generalization performance of the proposed CNN. Experimental results show that compared with traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks, the 1D-CNN model better performs in recognition of targets with different Doppler shifts and SNRs. The outstanding generalization ability of the proposed model shows that it is suitable for practical engineering applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A mathematical model for Shigellosis including disease carriers with multiple control strategies is developed. We compute the effective reproductive number Re, which is used to analyze the local stability of the equilibria, while the comparison theorem is used to prove global stability. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, the model endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when Re&gt;1. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the parameters that have a high impact on the transmission dynamics of the disease with direct transmission contributing more infections than indirect transmission. The effects of control measures are then investigated both analytically and numerically. Numerical results show that there is a reduction in the number of infections when at least a single control measure is applied efficiently. However, as the number of control interventions increases, Shigellosis elimination is more possible. Results also show that carriers play a potential role in the prevalence of Shigellosis and ignoring these individuals could potentially undermine the efforts of containing this epidemic.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Chenyu Li</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Guohua Liu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper applied block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target recognition. The traditional sparse representation-based classification (SRC) operates on the global dictionary collaborated by different classes. Afterwards, the similarities between the test sample and various classes are evaluated by the reconstruction errors. This paper reconstructs the test sample based on local dictionaries formed by individual classes. Considering the azimuthal sensitivity of SAR images, the linear coefficients on the local dictionary are sparse ones with block structure. Therefore, to solve the sparse coefficients, the BSBL is employed. The proposed method can better exploit the representation capability of each class, thus benefiting the recognition performance. Based on the experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) dataset, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is confirmed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>LCL filter has been widely used in the grid connected inverter, since it is effective in attenuation of the switching frequency harmonics in the inverter. However, the resonance in this filter causes stability problems and must be damped effectively to achieve stability. There are some methods to damp the resonance; one method is passive damping of resonance by adding a series resistor with the filter capacitor, but passive element reduces the inverter efficiency. Other method uses active damping (AD) by adding a proportional control loop of filter capacitor current, but this method needs additional sensor to measure filter capacitor current; moreover, when the control loops are digitally implemented, the computation delay in AD control loop will lead to some difficulties in choosing control parameters and maintaining system stability. This paper presents current control scheme for the grid connected inverter with the LCL filter. The proposed scheme ensures the control of injected current into grid with AD of the resonance in the LCL filter while keeping system stability and eliminating the effect of computation delay of the AD loop. An estimation of filter capacitor current with one step ahead is performed using the discrete time observer based on measuring the injected current. This reduces the cost and increases the robustness of the system. Proportional Resonant (PR) controller is used to control the injected current. Design of control system and choosing its parameters are studied and justified in details to ensure suitable performance with adequate stability margins. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed control scheme.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Micro- and nanofibrillated cellulose (MNFC) was extracted from pineapple stems by acid hydrolysis, then characterized and tested in two concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) in polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesives. The modified adhesives were used to glue three tropical wood species (Vochysia ferruginea, Cordia alliodora, and Gmelina arborea), and their corresponding bond strength resistance was determined. MNFC and the correspondent adhesives were characterized by TGA, FTIR, SEM, TEM, AFM, and viscosity determination. The TGA analysis of MNFC showed three decomposition reactions. The SEM, TEM, and AFM evaluations demonstrated the presence of micro- and nanosized dimensions of particles after the acid hydrolysis of pineapple stems. Adding 1 wt% MNFC to PVAc and UF adhesives increased their thermal stability in similar manner. Viscosity diminished in both modified adhesives with MNFC; however, this reduction did not affect the adhesion properties in the tropical wood tested. MNFC added to PVAc and UF adhesives improved shear strength (SS) of the glue line in the three tropical species tested. The highest SS increase was obtained when adding 0.5 wt% MNFC to PVAc in V. ferruginea, and 1 wt% MNFC concentration in the case of C. alliodora and G. arborea. In the case of UF adhesives, the application of 1 wt% MNFC produced significant differences in SS for the three tropical species studied.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Self-irradiation can affect durability of glasses used to immobilize high-level nuclear waste (HLW). The stability of glasses can also be indirectly affected by the radiolytic changes in contact water leading to decrease in its pH although this is unlikely to occur for disposal systems where the interaction of groundwater with glass is delayed to times when radiation dose rates are decreased to levels insignificant to cause such effects. Besides, interaction of the water influenced by radiation with other repository protective elements (container and bentonite) will suppress the radiolytic changes. Literature analysis shows practical absence or very weak effect of self-irradiation on structure and characteristics of borosilicate glasses with typical content of nuclear waste. Data for aluminophosphate glass used in Russia have showed that, after γ-irradiation with a dose of 6.2·107 Gy, the leaching rates of elements were decreased approximately twice relatively to pristine samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Network-wide maintenance lacks strong theoretical support and practical cases. However, research on this topic has entered an extensive exploratory stage; for example, new network design methods are being sought, and successful practices from traditional maintenance by line and by profession are being incorporated. This paper proposes a novel set-covering model with the variable coverage radius for the maintenance network of urban rail transit systems in the context of network-wide maintenance. The concepts of network-wide maintenance follow principles that are similar to those of bio-geography-based optimization (BBO), i.e., patterns of migration, variation, and extinction of different populations in different habitats. Therefore, a BBO algorithm is implemented with combinatorial optimization programming. Experiments from Changchun city in China show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective in fulfilling network-wide requirements through a direct tradeoff between the coverage radius and maintenance response time. In addition, the maintenance capacity and variable coverage radius of each maintenance point influence both the maintenance timeliness and resource utilization of maintenance units.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>DeokJu Kim</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Considering the high socioeconomic costs related to the increasing number of dementia patients and their poor quality of life and that of their families, it is important to identify the condition early on and provide an appropriate intervention. This study organized a recollection-based occupational therapy program: a nonpharmacological intervention consisting of five categories of activities (physical, horticultural, musical, art, and instrumental activity of daily living; IADL) and applied it to those having a mild stage of Alzheimer’s disease. The experimental group participated in a total of 24 sessions––five times per week for one hour per session––while the control group took part in regular activities offered by the existing facilities. The experimental group presented improved cognitive functions, reduced depression, and enhanced quality of life; the two groups showed a statistically significant difference in every category. This study is meaningful in that it made a cognitive stimulation program concerning five different categories, implemented it for people suffering mild dementia, and confirmed positive outcomes. If a systemic version of the program is offered in dementia care facilities, it is expected to make a considerable contribution to the care of dementia patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Education is mandatory, and much research has been invested in this sector. An important aspect of education is how to evaluate the learners’ progress. Multiple-choice tests are widely used for this purpose. The tests for learners in the same exam should come in equal difficulties for fair judgment. Thus, this requirement leads to the problem of generating tests with equal difficulties, which is also known as the specific case of generating tests with a single objective. However, in practice, multiple requirements (objectives) are enforced while making tests. For example, teachers may require the generated tests to have the same difficulty and the same test duration. In this paper, we propose the use of Multiswarm Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MMPSO) for generating k tests with multiple objectives in a single run. Additionally, we also incorporate Simulated Annealing (SA) to improve the diversity of tests and the accuracy of solutions. The experimental results with various criteria show that our approaches are effective and efficient for the problem of generating multiple tests.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Food safety remains a matter of great concern in most countries and the composition in food is crucial to food safety. It is very important to make sense of the quality and change of food ingredients. In this research, the change of γ-butyrolactone (GBL), one kind of food additive in beverage, had been evaluated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The 1H-NMR results of seven beverages covering various kinds with spiked GBL indicated that GBL was transformed into dangerous γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in six popular beverages under certain conditions which could happen during transportation and storage. Further results of quantitative 13C-NMR showed that pH and temperature were two key factors affecting the transforming degree of GBL to GHB. Lower pH and higher temperature will increase the degree of transformation. GHB was a neurotransmitter on the chemical control list, which was absolutely forbidden to be added to food. This nondestructive NMR detecting technology which did not need the complex pretreatment method to directly determine food ingredients can be useful for identifying the risk of food safety from the changes of food composition during transport and storage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Scaling is frequently observed in geothermal fields and reduces the energy harvesting of power plants. Recently, Sb-rich deposits have developed in many fields around the world. Various polymeric macromolecules have been used as antiscalants to mitigate the formation of scale. Testing potential commercial antiscalants in field conditions is a tedious and costly process. The artificial synthesis of geothermal deposits in the lab is a more practical and economical way to test the performance of antiscalants. This study obtained a Sb-rich deposit by refluxing SbCl3 and Na2S·3H2O in 18 h. The product was found to be a mixture of Sb2O3 and Sb2S3. We examined the performance of antiscalants such as poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), Gelatin, and poly(vinyl alcohol) of various molecular weights at 5 to 100 ppm. The formation of Sb2S3 is suppressed in the presence of the polymeric antiscalants. The dosage was found to be critical for the solubilization of Sb-rich deposits. Gelatin of 5 ppm showed the highest performance under the conditions employed in this study. While low dosages improve the concentration of [Sb3+], high dosages are required to increase the solubility of [S2-]. Moreover, the amount of deposit is reduced by 12.4% compared to the reference (in the absence of any polymeric molecules). Thus, comparatively, Gelatin shows the most promising performance among the molecules employed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D STE) is an emerging noninvasive method for predicting left ventricular remodeling (LVR) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Previous studies analyzed the predictive value of 3D STE with traditional models. However, no models that contain comprehensive risk factors were assessed, and there are limited data on the comparison of different 3D STE parameters. In this study, we sought to build a machine learning model for predicting LVR in AMI patients after effective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that contains the majority of the clinical risk factors and compare 3D STE parameters values for LVR prediction. We enrolled 135 first-onset AMI patients (120 males, mean age 54 ± 9 years). All patients went through a 3D STE and a traditional transthoracic echocardiography 24 hours after reperfusion. A second echocardiography was repeated at the three-month follow-up to detect LVR (defined as a 20 percent increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume). Six models were constructed using 15 risk factors. A receiver operator characteristic curve and four performance measurements were used as evaluation methods. Feature importance was used to compare 3D STE parameters. 26 patients (19.3%) had LVR. Our evaluation showed that RF can best predict LVR with the best AUC of 0.96. 3D GLS was the most valuable 3D STE parameters, followed by GCS, global area strain, and global radial strain (feature importance 0.146, 0.089, 0.087, and 0.069, respectively). To sum up, RF models can accurately predict the LVR after AMI, and 3D GLS was the best 3D STE parameters in predicting the LVR.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accurate predictions of remaining useful life (RUL) of important components play a crucial role in system reliability, which is the basis of prognostics and health management (PHM). This paper proposed an integrated deep learning approach for RUL prediction of a turbofan engine by integrating an autoencoder (AE) with a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). In the pretraining stage, the reconstructed data of the AE not only participate in its error reconstruction but also take part in the DCGAN parameter training as the generated data of the DCGAN. Through double-error reconstructions, the capability of feature extraction is enhanced, and high-level abstract information is obtained. In the fine-tuning stage, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to extract the sequential information from the features to predict the RUL. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified on the NASA commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated via excellent prediction performance and comparisons with other existing state-of-the-art prognostics. The results of this study suggest that the proposed data-driven prognostic method offers a new and promising prediction approach and an efficient feature extraction scheme.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ultrasonography is widely used in the clinical diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound images of thyroid nodules have different appearances, interior features, and blurred borders that are difficult for a physician to diagnose into malignant or benign types merely through visual recognition. The development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has led to great advances in the field of medical image diagnosis. However, there are some challenges to achieve precision and efficiency in the recognition of thyroid nodules. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture, you only look once v3 dense multireceptive fields convolutional neural network (YOLOv3-DMRF), based on YOLOv3. It comprises a DMRF-CNN and multiscale detection layers. In DMRF-CNN, we integrate dilated convolution with different dilation rates to continue passing the edge and the texture features to deeper layers. Two different scale detection layers are deployed to recognize the different sizes of the thyroid nodules. We used two datasets to train and evaluate the YOLOv3-DMRF during the experiments. One dataset includes 699 original ultrasound images of thyroid nodules collected from a local health physical center. We obtained 10,485 images after data augmentation. Another dataset is an open-access dataset that includes ultrasound images of 111 malignant and 41 benign thyroid nodules. Average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) are used as the metrics for quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We compared the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF with some state-of-the-art deep learning networks. The experimental results show that YOLOv3-DMRF outperforms others on mAP and detection time on both the datasets. Specifically, the values of mAP and detection time were 90.05 and 95.23% and 3.7 and 2.2 s, respectively, on the two test datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF is efficient for detection and recognition of thyroid nodules for ultrasound images.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Agriculture is mainly responsible for ammonia (NH3) volatilisation. A common effort to produce reliable quantifications, national emission inventories, and policies is needed to reduce health and environmental issues related to this emission. Sources of NH3 are locally distributed and mainly depend on farm building characteristics, management of excreta, and the field application of mineral fertilisers. To date, appropriate measurements related to the application of fertilisers to the field are still scarce in the literature. Proper quantification of NH3 must consider the nature of the fertiliser, the environmental variables that influence the dynamic of the emission, and a reliable measurement method. This paper presents the state of the art of the most commonly used direct methods to measure NH3 volatilisation following field application of fertilisers, mainly focusing on chamber method. The characteristics and the associated uncertainty of the measurement of the most widespread chamber types are discussed and compared to the micrometeorological methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As a result of the influence of clock drift and uncertainty delay in synchronous message transmission, the clock synchronization model based on statistical distribution cannot accurately describe clock deviation. This model also requires a large number of timestamp samples that cause a storage occupation issue for wireless sensor nodes with limited resources. The modeling method based on grey prediction has advantages of low sample demand and simple modeling process. However, the accuracy of the existing clock synchronization models needs to be improved. Based on the grey prediction theory, this paper proposes an adaptive fractional-order operator clock synchronization algorithm considering uncertainty delay. First, based on the clock model and clock offset model, the frequency offset between nodes is optimized by taking the mean on the clock frequencies. Second, a grey prediction algorithm based on a fractional-order operator is proposed by estimating the uncertainty delay in message transmission to obtain the clock offset. Finally, the order of the fractional-order accumulation is adjusted adaptively in the grey prediction model according to the collected timestamp sample values so that the estimation of the uncertainty delay is more accurate, thereby improving the accuracy of the clock offset. Compared with the first-order accumulative grey prediction clock synchronization algorithms and timing-sync protocol for sensor networks, the proposed scheme improved the synchronization accuracy by 29.18% and 44.01%, respectively, and reduced the variance of the clock offset by 48.66% and 64.89%. Thus, the proposed algorithm is characterized by improved stability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The cyberphysical system (CPS) is becoming the infrastructure of society. Unfortunately, the CPS is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may cause environmental pollution, property losses, and even casualties. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional Internet, the devices in CPSs are more specific, and the device systems may not be upgraded or installed with new programs during their life spans. The selection of the best defense nodes for defeating cyberattacks is quite challenging in CPSs. To overcome this issue, several attack-defense modeled methods have been proposed. However, few existing studies have considered the defense cost, which is usually a determinant in practice. In this paper, we propose a method for choosing optimal defense nodes that (1) can defeat specific attacks and (2) are inexpensive. First, the atom attack defense tree (A2DTree) is proposed by adding constraints to the conventional attack defense tree (ADTree). Second, the algebraic method is used to efficiently calculate the minimum defense cost. On this basis, a minimum defense cost calculation tool is designed and implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with two typical case studies, and a comparative experiment of related work is carried out. The results show that the method can correctly and efficiently identify the optimal defense nodes and calculate the minimum defense cost of a CPS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A large-scale persistent strong dense fog (SDF) event that occurred from December 30, 2016, to January 5, 2017, in central and eastern China is analyzed by using a variety of data, including high-resolution satellite and surface observations, meteorological tower observations, fine-resolution sounding observations, and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The results show the following: (1) The SDF event has the characteristics of long duration, wide influence range, large intensity, and serious air pollution. During the study period, there are 531 stations with SDF events, covering an area of over 360,000 km2. There were five stations in Hebei province where the fog lasted for more than 77 hours, and even some stations did not dissipate during the day. (2) Radiation fog and advection fog alternate in this SDF event, namely, radiation fog (20:00 BT on December 30 to 14:00 on January 1), advection radiation fog (20:00 on January 1 to 08:00 on January 2), radiation fog (night on January 2 to daytime on January 3), and advection radiation fog (night on January 3 to January 5). The characteristic of radiation fog is that the central and eastern part of China was controlled by “L” type high pressure. In the stage of advection radiation fog, the combined effect of weak cold advection and radiation cooling leads to the occurrence of SDF. (3) Regarding the duration of the fog event, the inversion structure is continuously maintained at night and in the morning near the stratum, and when the fog intensity is strong, the inversion intensity is correspondingly large, the fog top is lower than the inversion layer top, and the top of the SDF is between 80 and 400 meters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments are closely associated with each other’s dissipation structure, which contains various coordinated and noncoordinated coupling states. Based on the perspective of reverse thinking and problem diagnosis, this paper constructs a bridge from uncoordinated pathology to coordinated development. From the perspective of incongruity, the framework model and evaluation index system of tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments incongruity coupling coordination driving mechanism are constructed. Also, the variation coefficient method is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation index and the coupling relationship and evolution of tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments in Liupanshui city are analyzed by the noncoordination coupling function. The results suggest the following: (1) During the study period, the poverty alleviation level of tourism in Liupanshui city presents a continuous growth curve. Meanwhile, ecological environment development level depicts rapid growth initially and then slows down and improves further. In this way, it shows different stage characteristics from the tourism poverty alleviation level. (2) The discordant coupling between tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments in Liupanshui city shows a decreasing curve. So, the noncoordinated development relationship between tourism poverty alleviation and ecological environments is significant.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Several graph invariants have been defined and studied, which present applications in nanochemistry, computer networks, and other areas of science. One vastly studied class of the graph invariants is the class of the topological indices, which helps in the studies of chemical, biological, and physical properties of a chemical structure. One recently introduced graph invariant is the face index, which can assist in predicting the energy and the boiling points of the certain chemical structures. In this paper, we drive the analytical closed formulas of face index of silicon carbides Si2C3−Ia,b, Si2C3−IIa,b, Si2C3−IIIa,b, and SiC3−IIIa,b.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents the flight penetration path planning algorithm in a complex environment with Bogie or Bandit (BB) threats for stealth unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The emergence of rigorous air defense radar net necessitates efficient flight path planning and replanning for stealth UAV concerning survivability and penetration ability. We propose the improved A-Star algorithm based on the multiple step search approach to deal with this uprising problem. The objective is to achieve rapid penetration path planning for stealth UAV in a complex environment. Firstly, the combination of single-base radar, dual-base radar, and BB threats is adopted to different threat scenarios which are closer to the real combat environment. Besides, the multistep search strategy, the prediction technique, and path planning algorithm are developed for stealth UAV to deal with BB threats and achieve the penetration path replanning in complex scenarios. Moreover, the attitude angle information is integrated into the flight path which can meet real flight requirements for stealth UAV. The theoretical analysis and numerical results prove the validity of our method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To improve the performance of location accuracy for wireless sensor network, a new location algorithm based on mobile anchor node and modified hop count is proposed. Firstly, we set different communication powers for all nodes to make them have different communication ranges. This makes the relationship between the hop count and real distance more accurate. Secondly, the unknown node computes the mean distance per hop between it and the three anchor nodes that are the nearest to the unknown node and uses the mean value as the mean distance per hop. Finally, we suppose that some anchor nodes can move. Once the position of some anchor nodes changes, we recalculate the positions of unknown nodes and use the mean value of recorded positions as position of unknown nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed method has lower location error than other methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, certain Hermite–Hadamard–Mercer-type inequalities are proved via Riemann–-Liouville fractional integral operators. We established several new variants of Hermite–Hadamard’s inequalities for Riemann–Liouville fractional integral operators by utilizing Jensen–Mercer inequality for differentiable mapping ϒ whose derivatives in the absolute values are convex. Moreover, we construct new lemmas for differentiable functions ϒ′, ϒ″, and ϒ‴ and formulate related inequalities for these differentiable functions using variants of Hölder’s inequality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Adopting a plant-based diet (PBD) and lifestyle is healthy, sustainable, and increasingly popular, while also demanding. Individuals might face challenges to maintain this lifestyle. We aimed to determine the anthropometric values and lifestyle factors and motives of adults to adopt a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) lifestyle by joining our ongoing, community-based, WFPB lifestyle program 0.5–10 years ago. Methods. We measured body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage status (BF%) using bioimpedance. Lifestyle status was obtained by standardized electronic questionnaires. For evaluating the motives for following strict PBD, the participants were asked to rank 8 different motives (i.e., 8: the most-, 1: the least important). Setting. A cross-sectional study in Slovenia. Participants. A total of 151 healthy adults with an average age of 39.6 years (SD: 12.5 years). Results. The participants had an average BMI of 23.9 kg/m2 (SD: 3.8 kg/m2) and an average BF% of 22.3% (SD: 7.3%), were physically very active, with an average Long International Physical Activity Questionnaire (L-IPAQ) score of 5541.2 metabolic equivalents (METs) min/week (SD: 4677.0 METs min/week), having good sleep quality, with an average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 2.7 (SD: 1.8), perceiving low stress, and with an average Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) score of 0.29 (SD: 0.1). We discovered no significant differences in lifestyle between participants who were involved in our WFPB lifestyle program for short, medium, or long periods of time. The motives for WFPB lifestyle included health benefits (score: 7.9/8), body mass management (6.3), eating to satiety (4.9), convenience (4.3), environmental concerns (4.1), affordability (3.7), animal ethics (3.6), and religious reasons (1.1). Conclusion. A WFPB lifestyle program for any length of time that includes an extensive support system provides favorable, long-term lifestyle changes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Averrhoa bilimbi has been long thought to have biological activity. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of primary and secondary metabolites from A. bilimbi fruit extract on Aedes aegypti larvae mortality and midgut histopathology. Experiment was performed to third-instar Ae. aegypti larvae collected from Surabaya, which then exposed to A. bilimbi crude fruit extract at various concentration for 24 hours. After exposure, larvae were evaluated of its mortality and fixed in 2.5% neutral buffer formalin before processed and sectioned into histological slides and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman rank correlation to determine histopathological damage on midgut of Ae. aegypti larvae. Phytochemical screening of A. bilimbi crude fruit extract found that it contained saponins, tannins, and terpenoids. Minimum concentration able to induce mortality on Ae. aegypti larvae (LC50) was 977 ppm, while LC90 was at 1380 ppm. Severe alteration of larvae midgut was found after 24 hours exposure to 2000 ppm extract. Features of damage mostly found in larvae midgut were disruption of the microvilli, columnar cell vacuolization, epithelial nucleus crossed midgut lumen, and basal membrane damage. Damage caused by fruit extract in midgut of Ae. aegypti third instar larvae inhibited development of larvae. This study reported first finding of histopathological effect of A. bilimbi fruits extract on Ae. aegypti larvae midgut. Result of study was expected to contribute to better understand extract bioactivity of this plant to be applied as natural larvicide for Ae. aegypti.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The main and interactive effect of biological maturity and relative age upon physical performance in adolescent male soccer players was considered. Consistent with previous research, it was hypothesised that participants of greater maturity or born earlier in the selection year would perform better in terms of physical performance tests. This cross-sectional study consisted of 84 male participants aged between 11.3 and 16.2 years from a professional soccer academy in the English Premier League. Date of birth, height, weight, and parental height were collected. Sprint, change of direction, countermovement jump, and reactive strength index were considered for physical performance. Relative age was based on the birth quarter for the selection year. Maturity status was based upon the percentage of predicted adult height attained. Linear regression models highlighted that maturation was associated with performance on all but one of the physical performance tests, the reactive strength index. In contrast, relative age only served as a significant predictor of performance on the countermovement jump. This study indicated that physical performance (in the tests studied) seems to be related to the biological maturity status of a player but not their relative age. This finding is important because it suggests that early-maturing players perform better in the majority of physical performance tests, and the commonly held belief that relative age effect influences performance may be overstated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this work is to manage the waste product based on polyethylene (PE) films by recycling and reusing it as antistatic material for electronic packaging and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material for protecting electronic equipment from interference of EM radiation. To achieve this, a conductive carbon black has been mixed with the PE waste at different weight percent values by ultrasonication via a solution mixing process. Mixing time for sonication was determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectra. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study showed that the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) are immiscible in their blend composition. The tensile properties of PE have reduced substantially after reprocessing. However, the addition of carbon black has improved its strength up to a certain loading. The electrical percolation threshold values, calculated using the classical power law and sigmoidal Boltzmann model, were obtained at 3.5 and 2.8 wt% loading of carbon black, respectively. The conductivity result revealed that 1-2 wt% carbon-loaded composites can be used as antistatic material. The composites, having carbon loading above 4 wt%, can be effective materials for EMI shielding application. The 10 wt% carbon-loaded composite exhibits EMI SE value 33 dB which means there is approximately 99.93% protection of EM radiation at the sample thickness of 1.0 mm. Moreover, FTIR analysis, thermal stability, AC conductivity, dielectric properties, permeability, and current-voltage characteristics are also discussed in detail. There is a substantial increment in thermal stability, and dielectric properties are observed with the addition carbon black loading within the polymer matrix.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the east of China, low temperature and light energy in winter are the main factors for the decline in cucumber yield, as well as in greenhouses without supplementary light. Optimal utilization of light energy is critical to increase cucumber yield. In this study, experimental measurements were conducted in two scenarios, April to May (Apr-May) and November to December (Nov-Dec) 2015, respectively, to analyze leaf development, dry matter accumulation, and yield of cultivated cucumber. Statistical analysis showed that leaves grew in Nov-Dec had larger leaf area and lower dry matter than leaves grew in Apr-May. This revealed that the dry matter accumulation rate per unit area was lower in winter. To be precise, the yield 0.174 kg/m2 per day in Nov-Dec was 35.3% lower than the yield in Apr-May. Environmental monitoring data showed that there was no significant difference in the average temperature between two scenarios, but the light intensity in Nov-Dec was only 2/3 of that in Apr-May. Three-dimensional (3D) cucumber canopy models were used in this study to quantify the effects of weak light on dry matter production in Nov-Dec. Three 3D canopies of cucumber were reconstructed with 20, 25, and 30 leaves per plant, respectively, by using a parametric modeling method. Light interception of three canopies from 8:00 to 15:00 on 4 November 2015 was simulated by using the radiosity-graphic combined model (RGM) with an hourly time step. CO2 assimilation per unit area was calculated using the FvCB photosynthetic model. As a result, the effects of light intensity and CO2 concentration on the photosynthetic rate were considered. The leaf photosynthesis simulation result showed that during the daytime in winter, the RuBP regeneration-limited assimilation Aj was always less than the Rubisco-limited assimilation Ac. This means that the limiting factor affecting the photosynthesis rate in winter was rather light intensity. As the CO2 concentration in the greenhouse was utmost in the morning, increasing the light intensity and therefrom increasing the canopy light interception at this time will be highly beneficial to increase the yield production. Through a comparative analysis of photosynthetic characteristics in these three virtual 3D canopies, the 25-leaf canopy was the best-performed canopy structure in photosynthetic production in winter. This study provides an insight into the light deficiency for yield production in winter and a solution to make optimal use of light in the greenhouse.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Solar light has fundamental roles in vast chemical, biochemical, and physical process in biosphere and hence been declared as “source of life.” Solar light is further classified into a broad range of electromagnetic waves, and each region in the solar spectrum bears its unique actions in the universe or biosphere. Since centuries, solar light is believed as a potent source of killing pathogens causing postharvest losses on food products as well as human skin diseases. Citrus fruit crops are widely produced and consumed across the world, but due to their higher juicy contents, Penicillium italicum (blue mold) and Penicillium digitatum (green mold) make their entry to decay fruits and cause approximately 80% and 30% fruit losses, respectively. Agrochemicals or synthetic fungicides are highly efficient to control these postharvest fungal pathogens but have certain health concerns due to toxic environmental residues. Therefore, the scientific community is ever looking for some physical ways to eradicate such postharvest fungal pathogens and reduce the yield losses along with maintaining the public health concerns. This review article presents and discusses existing available information about the positive and negative impacts of different spectrums of solar light exposure on the postharvest storage of citrus fruits, especially to check citrus postharvest rotting caused by Penicillium italicum (blue mold) and Penicillium digitatum (green mold). Moreover, a special focus shall be paid to blue light (390–500 nm), which efficiently reduces the decay of fruits, while keeping the host tissues/cells healthy with no known cytotoxicity, killing the fungal pathogen probably by ferroptosis, but indepth knowledge is scanty. The study defines how to develop commercial applications of light in the postharvest citrus industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication and control system linking the human brain and computers or other electronic devices. However, irrelevant channels and misleading features unrelated to tasks limit classification performance. To address these problems, we propose an efficient signal processing framework based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for channel and feature selection, channel selection, and feature selection. Modified Stockwell transforms were used for a feature extraction, and multilevel hybrid PSO-Bayesian linear discriminant analysis was applied to optimization and classification. The BCI Competition III dataset I was used here to confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme. Compared to a method without optimization (89% accuracy), the best classification accuracy of the PSO-based scheme was 99% when less than 10.5% of the original features were used, the test time was reduced by more than 90%, and it achieved Kappa values and F-score of 0.98 and 98.99%, respectively, and better signal-to-noise ratio, thereby outperforming existing algorithms. The results show that the channel and feature selection scheme can accelerate the speed of convergence to the global optimum and reduce the training time. As the proposed framework can significantly improve classification performance, effectively reduce the number of features, and greatly shorten the test time, it can serve as a reference for related real-time BCI application system research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the optimization of problems in dynamic environments, algorithms need to not only find the global optimal solutions in a specific environment but also to continuously track the moving optimal solutions over dynamic environments. To address this requirement, a species conservation-based particle swarm optimization (PSO), combined with a spatial neighbourhood best searching technique, is proposed. This algorithm employs a species conservation technique to save the found optima distributed in the search space, and these saved optima either transferred into the new population or replaced by the better individual within a certain distance in the subsequent evolution. The particles in the population are attracted by its history best and the optimal solution nearby based on the Euclidean distance other than the index-based. An experimental study is conducted based on the moving peaks benchmark to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms widely used in dynamic optimization problems. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for tracking the moving optima in dynamic environments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Herein, a rapid and highly sensitive amperometric biosensor for the detection of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was constructed via an electrochemical approach, in which the glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) was modified on the surface of reduced graphene oxide-gold nanoparticle composite (rGO-Aunano composite). The rGO-Aunano composite was one-step electrodeposited onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface and was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical techniques. In addition, the rGO-Aunano/GCE was also found to electrocatalyze the oxidation of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) at the peak potential of 0.3 V, which was negatively shifted compared with that at bare GCE or Aunano/GCE, illustrating better catalytic performance of rGO-Aunano. After the modification of GLUD, the GLUD/rGO-Aunano/GCE led to effective amperometric detection of α-KG through monitoring the NADH consumption and displayed a linear response in the range of 66.7 and 494.5 μM, with the detection limit of 9.2 μM. Moreover, the prepared GLUD/rGO-Aunano/GCE was further evaluated to be highly selective and used to test α-KG in human serum samples. The recovery and the RSD values were calculated in the range of 97.9–102.4% and 3.8–4.5%, respectively, showing a great prospect for its real application.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cellular aging. Mitophagy is a critical mitochondrial quality control mechanism that removes dysfunctional mitochondria and contributes to cell survival. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes survival of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but its potential effect on cellular aging is unknown yet. We found that IGF-1 decreased cell senescence, prevented DNA telomere shortening, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, activated cytochrome C oxidase, and reduced mitochondrial DNA damage in long-term cultured (aged) aortic SMC, suggesting an antiaging effect. IGF-1 increased mitophagy in aged cells, and this was associated with decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p21 and elevated levels of Nrf2 and Sirt3, regulators of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. SiRNA-induced inhibition of either Nrf2 or Sirt3 blocked IGF-1-induced upregulation of mitophagy, suggesting that the Nrf2/Sirt3 pathway was required for IGF-1’s effect on mitophagy. PINK1 is a master regulator of mitophagy. PINK1 silencing suppressed mitophagy and inhibited IGF-1-induced antiaging effects in aged SMC, consistent with an essential role of mitophagy in IGF-1’s effect on cellular aging. Thus, IGF-1 inhibited cellular aging via Nrf2/Sirt3-dependent activation of mitophagy. Our data suggest that activation of IGF-1 signaling is a novel potential strategy to activate mitophagy and slow cellular aging.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Guangchen Mu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Pengshan Ren</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A compact, low-profile wearable antenna capable of operation within the 5.1–5.46 GHz and 5.7–5.85 GHz medical body-area network band is suggested to make the antenna better for wearable devices. The integrated metasurface (MSs) antenna consists of as few as array of three wan-shaped components, directly below the planar waveguide-fed monopole antenna. The measurement of the integrated antenna is 0.56λ0×0.56λ0×0.08λ0, all while achieving an average gain of 8.2 dBi in working frequency and a front-to-back ratio (FB) in excess of 19 dB. As demonstrated by in-depth examination, the antenna performs exceptionally well in withstanding the distortion of structure, far superior to planar monopole antenna. Additionally, the metasurface enables the specific absorption rate (SAR) low to 0.84 W/kg, which makes this type of antenna suited to application in different wearable devices.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Veterinary practices or activities expose professionals, including students, to hazards associated with animal contact. To describe workplace health and safety status and risk factors associated with hazards among veterinary clinical students in South West Nigeria, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using a semistructured questionnaire. Data on demographics, health and safety (HS) status, work-related hazards, healthcare facilities, and immunisation history were obtained. Of 167 students recruited, 100 (60.2%) were males, and &gt;77.1% fell within the age group of 21–25 years. Many participants (77.0%) reported the lack of active HS committee. Exposures to various physical hazards (PHs) such as needlestick injuries (NSIs, 41.5%), animal scratches (42.0%), animal kicks (33.0%), falls/slips (25.0%), and, less frequently, animal bites (13.8%) were reported. Allergies (35.9%) and acute gastrointestinal infection (25.6%) mainly after contact with dogs presented with parvoviral enteritis were reported. For chemical hazards, 27.8% and 29.0% of participants indicated having had eye burn and choke on exposure to formalin. No adequate immunisation against either tetanus, rabies, or both was provided (&lt;18%). An association between accommodation type and students’ level of health and safety training was observed (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.241–0.897, p=0.02), and frequencies of student contact with various animal types were strongly associated with exposures to different physical and biological risks (p&lt;0.05). This study revealed poor health and safety training, practices, and increased exposure of students to a wide range of hazards. Therefore, the development of mitigation programmes in veterinary schools becomes critical to safeguard students’ wellbeing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Real-life problems are governed by equations which are nonlinear in nature. Nonlinear equations occur in modeling problems, such as minimizing costs in industries and minimizing risks in businesses. A technique which does not involve the assumption of existence of a real constant whose calculation is unclear is used to obtain a strong convergence result for nonlinear equations of p,η-strongly monotone type, where η&gt;0,p&gt;1. An example is presented for the nonlinear equations of p,η-strongly monotone type. As a consequence of the main result, the solutions of convex minimization and variational inequality problems are obtained. This solution has applications in other fields such as engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and game theory.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) holds massive freshwater resources and is one of the most active regions in the world with respect to the hydrological cycle. Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological processes and is important for plant growth and ecosystem stability. To investigate the relationship between climatic factors (air temperature and precipitation) and SM during the growing season in various climate zones on the QTP, data from three observational stations were analyzed. The results showed that the daily average (Tave) and minimum air temperatures (Tmin) significantly influenced SM levels at all depths analyzed (i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm deep) at the three stations, and Tmin had a stronger effect on SM than did Tave. However, the daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) generally had little effect on SM, although it had showed some effects on SM in the middle and deeper layers at the Jiali station. Precipitation was an important factor that significantly influenced the SM at all depths at the three stations, but the influence on SM in the middle and deep layers lagged the direct effect on near-surface SM by 5–7 days. These results suggest that environment characterized by lower temperatures and higher precipitation may promote SM conservation during the growing season and in turn support ecosystem stability on the QTP.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we discuss the representations of n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebras as a generalization of the notion of representations for n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras. We also give the cohomology of an n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra and obtain a relation between extensions of an n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra b by an abelian one a and Z1b,a0¯. We also introduce the notion of T∗-extensions of n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebras and prove that every finite-dimensional nilpotent metric n-ary multiplicative Hom-Nambu-Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 in the case α is a surjection is isometric to a suitable T∗-extension.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Salt is a common cause of damage to building materials used in cultural and historical buildings. The damage to aged wood in historical wooden buildings has not been extensively studied, resulting in the need for a more detailed analysis. In this work, Yingxian Wooden Pagoda, a typical historical wooden structure, was taken as the research object. Multichemical analyses were conducted to evaluate and understand the salt-induced damage to the aged wood using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, sulphur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and attenuated total reflectance fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. The results showed the presence of invasive salt crystallisations and ions in the aged samples. The source of these invasive elements was deduced by identifying the type, amount, and valency of the elements; they were found to be derived from environmental factors such as acid rain and atmospheric pollutant. The unique damage mechanism and route induced by salt in historical buildings made of wood were summarised; the damage was attributed to the accumulation of sulphate salt causing hydrolysis of the carbohydrates and salt crystallisation resulting in mechanical damage. This interdisciplinary study is significant for decision making in studies related to the preservation and evaluation of historical wooden buildings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of the increasing demand for cooling air in cabin and electronic components on aircraft, it urges to present an energy-efficient optimum method for the ram air inlet system. A ram air performance evaluation method is proposed, and the main structural parameters can be extended to a certain type of aircraft. The influence of structural parameters on the ram air performance is studied, and a database for the performance is generated. A new method of integrating the BP neural networks and genetic algorithm is used for structure optimization and is proven effective. Moreover, the optimum result of the structure of the NACA ram air inlet system is deduced. Results show that (1) the optimization algorithm is efficient with less prediction error of the mass flow rate and fuel penalty. The average relative error of the mass flow rate is 1.37%, and the average relative error of the fuel penalty is 1.41% in the full samples. (2) Predicted deviation analysis shows very little difference between optimized and unoptimized design. The relative error of the mass flow rate is 0.080% while that of the fuel penalty is 0.083%. The accuracy of the proposed optimization method is proven. (3) The mass flow rate after optimization is increased to 2.506 kg/s, and the fuel penalty is decreased by 74.595 Et kg. The BP neural networks and genetic algorithms are studied to optimize the design of the ram air inlet system. It is proven to be a novel approach, and the efficiency can be highly improved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study aims to detect Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) resistance in the veterinary hospital environment. S. aureus are one of the components of the microbiota, and they may be present in patients in a veterinary hospital environment. Methicillin resistance is determined by a chromosomal gene (mecA), which codes for modifications in the beta-lactam antibiotic receptor, where the penicillin-binding protein will have a low affinity for the antibiotic. Samples were collected through swabs of materials and equipment at the hospital. S. aureus was identified in 7.6% (21/276) of the samples collected, and of the 21 strains isolated, 4 (19.0%) carried the mecA gene. MRSA are all strains of S. aureus that express the mecA gene. Four strains harbor the mecA gene; however, only two expressed the phenotypic resistance to cefoxitin and were characterized as MRSA. An isolate (strain 18) present on a patient care table was identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus with intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin (VISA). Our observations suggest the need for containment measures (good antisepsis practices) to avoid the possible transmission of resistant bacterial agents for the veterinary hospital environment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Position control in electrical drives is a challenging problem which is complicated by sensor noise and unknown disturbances. This paper proposes a new cascade sensorless speed control technique for induction motor drives suitable for electric vehicle applications using the full-order adaptive Luenberger observer that is insensitive to measurement noise and parametric variation. The adaptive speed law is obtained by the Lyapunov method using the estimated currents and fluxes. This technique ensures the stability of the induction motor considered as nonlinear dynamic system. Since the Luenberger observer works on deterministic environment, and it is most effective when sensor noise is limited, the present study aims to design a robust observer insensitive to measurement noise and parametric variation integrated in a cascade structure. The observer allows the filtering of the measured currents. To highlight the advantages of the new scheme, a comparative study and spectrum analysis will be presented. The proposed structure is verified using MATLAB/Simulink.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An m-polar fuzzy set is a powerful mathematical model to analyze multipolar, multiattribute, and multi-index data. The m-polar fuzzy sets have appeared as a useful tool to portray uncertainty in multiattribute decision making. The purpose of this article is to analyze the aggregation operators under the m-polar fuzzy environment with the help of Dombi norm operations. In this article, we develop some averaging and geometric aggregation operators using Dombi t-norm and t-conorm to handle uncertainty in m-polar fuzzy (mF, henceforth) information, which are mF Dombi weighted averaging (mFDWA) operator, mF Dombi ordered weighted averaging (mFDOWA) operator, mF Dombi hybrid averaging (mFDHA) operator, mF Dombi weighted geometric (mFDWG) operator, mF Dombi weighted ordered geometric operator, and mF Dombi hybrid geometric (mFDHG) operator. We investigate properties, namely, idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness, for the proposed operators. Moreover, we give an algorithm to solve multicriteria decision-making issues which involve mF information with mFDWA and mFDWG operators. To prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed model, we solve two numerical examples with our proposed models and give comparison with mF-ELECTRE-I approach (Akram et al. 2019) and mF Hamacher aggregation operators (Waseem et al. 2019). Finally, we check the effectiveness of the developed operators by a validity test.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The widespread impacts of malaria in the tropical regions of the developing world are not only on healthcare issues but also an agricultural output. Malaria causes manpower loss when it strikes farmers at critical planting, weeding, and harvesting times. Given the above, the expected outcome to malaria prevention programs in farming communities remains a far cry, especially where the predisposing factors are not properly identified and long-lasting solutions proffered. Consequently, this study was designed to assess the malaria predisposing factors among the crop production farmers attending the Ndop District Hospital. The microscopy method was used to determine the presence of malaria parasitaemia. The following categorical variables were considered predisposing factors: Sex, history on malaria illness/treatment, use of long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) and knowledge on malaria transmission/prevention. A four-point Likert-type rating scale was adopted for the scoring of the responses given on the predisposing factors, while Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the associations between malaria and each of the predisposing factors. The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia among the crop production farmers was 20% (143/715). The predisposing factors tested were found to be significantly associated to the occurrence of malaria among the crop production farmers. Therefore, the combination of improved existing and innovative malaria control strategies may possibly ensure sustained malaria decrease among the farmers in the Ndop Health District.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. (1) To conduct a network meta-analysis of clinical drugs used for cardiogenic shock and (2) provide evidence for the selection of medication for the treatment of this condition. Methods. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China HowNet (CNKI), Wanfang database, and Weipu database were searched using keywords Dopamine, Dobutamine, Epinephrine, Adrenaline, Norepinephrine, Noradrenaline, Milrinone, Natriuretic peptide, Recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide, Levosimendan, Cardiac shock, and Cardiogenic shock. We select literature according to prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria and record data such as drug type, mortality, and adverse reactions. Results. Twenty-eight of 1387 articles met inclusion criteria, comprising 1806 patients who suffered from cardiogenic shock. Dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide, and levosimendan were all commonly used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Milrinone was most effective at reducing mortality and had the lowest incidence of adverse reactions. Conclusion. This network meta-analysis demonstrated that milrinone was the most effective medication at reducing mortality and adverse events in patients suffering from cardiogenic shock.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Amit Kumar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Aspergillus nidulans is a filamentous fungus that is a potential resource for industrial enzymes. It is a versatile fungal cell factory that can synthesize various industrial enzymes such as cellulases, β-glucosidases, hemicellulases, laccases, lipases, proteases, β-galactosidases, tannases, keratinase, cutinases, and aryl alcohol oxidase. A. nidulans has shown the potential to utilize low-cost substrates such as wheat bran, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, rice bran, coir pith, black gram residue, and chicken feathers to produce enzymes cost-effectively. A. nidulans has also been known as a model organism for the production of heterologous enzymes. Several studies reported genetically engineered strains of A. nidulans for the production of different enzymes. Native as well as heterologous enzymes of A. nidulans have been employed for various industrial processes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We consider the problem of best proximity point in locally convex spaces endowed with a weakly convex digraph. For that, we introduce the notions of nonself G-contraction and G-nonexpansive mappings, and we show that for each seminorm, we have a best proximity point. In addition, we conclude our work with a result showing the existence of best proximity point for every seminorm.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jacek Wojtanowski</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Tadeusz Drozd</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Beam of light shaping process can be considered ultimate, if both irradiance and wavefront spatial distributions are under control and both can be shaped arbitrarily. In order to keep these two quantities determined simultaneously, it is required to apply at least two powered refractive or reflective surfaces. In this paper, a fully geometric design method of double-freeform beam shapers is discussed briefly. The presented algorithm is based on two stages. First, integrable input-output ray mapping is calculated by the application of the novel GATMA (Geometric Approach to Monge–Ampere equation) method. It allows us to determine the shape of the first freeform surface. Then, according to the condition of constant optical path length between input and output plane, corrected by wavefront phases at those planes, the second surface is determined. GATMA algorithm combines advantages of Monge–Ampere (MA) equation and ray-tracing efficient apparatus. Compared to the state-of-the-art freeform design methods, GATMA does not need to solve MA equation directly but uses this equation as an error function. Such approach makes the computation algorithm simpler and more robust and convergent. The application of the proposed method in a challenging design example of a beam shaper, transforming uniform collimated beam into a beam having a triangular cross section and flat wavefront, is presented as a case study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Heat exchangers are widely used for heat recovery purposes in many industrial applications such as gasification systems. In a biomass gasification system situated at Melani village in Eastern Cape of South Africa, a significant quantity of heat energy is lost during syngas cooling. Thus, a heat exchanger was constructed and installed in the gasification system for the purpose of heat recovery. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the heat exchanger under variable operating conditions for counterflow and parallel flow configurations. The experimental investigation was carried out on a double pipe heat exchanger as the downdraft gasifier system operated on a wood consumption rate of 180 kg/h. The heat exchanger was installed at the exit point of the syngas in the gasifier, and water served as the cooling fluid. Inlet and outlet temperatures of the hot syngas and cooling water (fluids) were measured using thermocouples at variable flow rates. Experimental data were processed using energy equations to determine vital performance parameters (overall heat transfer coefficient, effectiveness, and log mean temperature difference). The findings showed that optimum heat exchanger effectiveness of 0.55 was determined at a mass flow rate of 0.07 kg/s. In addition, counterflow configuration was found to be approximately 14% more effective than the parallel flow configuration. This is attributed to the relative direction of the fluids in the configurations of both flows. The study recommends that double pipe heat exchanger is suitable for recovering heat from the gasification system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a new distribution with a unit interval named type II half logistic Kumaraswamy (TIIHLKw) distribution is proposed. Its density and distribution functions are presented using alternate expressions. This distribution is obtained by adding an extra parameter in the existing model to rise its ability fitting complex data sets. Some important statistical properties of TIIHLKw distribution are derived. The estimation of the parameters is obtained by numerous well-recognized approaches and simulation study confirmed the efficiencies of estimates such obtained. We apply the related model to practical datasets, and it is concluded that the proposed model is the best by model selection criteria than other competitive models.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A subgroup H of a finite group G is said to be quasi S-propermutable in G if K⊲¯G such that HK is S-permutable in G and H ∩ K≤HqsG, where HqsG is the subgroup formed by all those subgroups of H which are S-propermutable in G. In this paper, we give some generalizations of finite group G by using the properties and effects of quasi S-propermutable subgroups.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Bariatric surgery (BS) in older obese subjects (&gt;60 years of age) has risen in the past decade and will continue to rise in the coming years due to ageing of the population. Aim. To evaluate the short- (12 months) and long-term (60 months) results of laparoscopic sleeve gastroscopy (LSG) in patients older than age 60. Methods. We performed a retrospective review of patients prospectively included in a database from January 2007 to December 2013. All patients &gt;60 [older group (OG)] who had undergone LSG were included. The control group (CG) included patients aged 50 to 59 years who had undergone LSG during the same period. Results. 116 (8.4 % of total surgery) and 145 patients were included in the OG and CG, respectively. BS in patients &gt;60 years increased from 2.4% in 2003 to 14% in the last 2 years of the study. After inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, all absolute standardized differences were &lt;0.15. A 60-month follow-up was attained in 90% of patients in the OG and 74% in the CG. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between the two groups. At 12 and 60 months after LSG, both groups achieved a similar body mass index. There was no statistical difference in the percentage of resolution of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and SAHS between the two groups. In both groups, all the nutritional parameters evaluated remained within the normal range throughout the study. Conclusions. LSG provides acceptable outcomes and is safe in older adults indicating that age should not be a limitation to perform BS in this population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The timing of eruption of permanent teeth can be a precious help to the pediatric practitioner in identifying an appropriate treatment plan. Usually, it presents a more precise sign of an early or late growth of the child. Aims. It is to determine whether the timing of the permanent teeth eruption in Lebanese pediatric population can be considered as standard Lebanese values, since no other study was previously performed. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study is conducted, and the clinical emergence data are collected for a sample of 2317 Lebanese children aged between 5.5 years and 13 years (1129 girls and 1188 boys) from different socioeconomic groups in rural and urban communities spread over different regions in Lebanon. The study investigates dental emergence patterns. Results. Statistical analysis is performed with the SPSS Software. A confidence interval of 95% and significance level of 5% are adopted. The trend is for males to begin their permanent teeth eruption later than girls. Emergence of all permanent mandibular teeth is earlier than maxillary ones. Symmetry is found between the right and left teeth in the maxilla, as well as in the mandibula. Conclusion. In this study, the results indicate that premolars and second permanent molars erupt earlier in the Lebanese children compared to children of other countries reflected in several studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Freeway travel time prediction is a key technology of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Many scholars have found that periodic function plays a positive role in improving the prediction accuracy of travel time prediction models. However, very few studies have comprehensively evaluated the impacts of different periodic functions on statistical and machine learning models. In this paper, our primary objective is to evaluate the performance of the six commonly used multistep ahead travel time prediction models (three statistical models and three machine learning models). In addition, we compared the impacts of three periodic functions on multistep ahead travel time prediction for different temporal scales (5-minute, 10-minute, and 15-minute). The results indicate that the periodic functions can improve the prediction performance of machine learning models for more than 60 minutes ahead prediction and improve the over 30 minutes ahead prediction accuracy for statistical models. Three periodic functions show a slight difference in improving the prediction accuracy of the six prediction models. For the same prediction step, the effect of the periodic function is more obvious at a higher level of aggregation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Next generation of Information Technologies (IT), such as edging/cloud computing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence, has been in a rapid development and therefore concerned wide areas. Management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) plays an increasingly important role on knowledge design and engineering, innovation and patent management, intangible assets audition, R&amp;D, and so forth; however, it also meets the challenges from proper platform and service provision, especially when large-scale mobile and distributed requirements become popular. In this paper, Intellectual Property Platforms and corresponding commercial tools have been collected, investigated, and reviewed, involving official platforms in China, USA, EU, and another 6 countries, as well as 12 intellectual property analysis tools commonly used online. Detailed comparison and discussion have been undertaken in order to find potential challenges and opportunities for improved service provision, for example, searching privacy preservation, cloud/edge-based service offloading and efficient distribution, and ontology-based intelligent IPR engineering, which can possibly be commercialised in the near future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Currently, echocardiography has become an essential technology for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Accurate classification of apical two-chamber (A2C), apical three-chamber (A3C), and apical four-chamber (A4C) views and the precise detection of the left ventricle can significantly reduce the workload of clinicians and improve the reproducibility of left ventricle segmentation. In addition, left ventricle detection is significant for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart chambers. Method. RetinaNet is a one-stage object detection algorithm that can achieve high accuracy and efficiency at the same time. RetinaNet is mainly composed of the residual network (ResNet), the feature pyramid network (FPN), and two fully convolutional networks (FCNs); one FCN is for the classification task, and the other is for the border regression task. Results. In this paper, we use the classification subnetwork to classify A2C, A3C, and A4C images and use the regression subnetworks to detect the left ventricle simultaneously. We display not only the position of the left ventricle on the test image but also the view category on the image, which will facilitate the diagnosis. We used the mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) as an index to measure the performance of left ventricle detection and the accuracy as an index to measure the effect of the classification of the three different views. Our study shows that both classification and detection effects are noteworthy. The classification accuracy rates of A2C, A3C, and A4C are 1.000, 0.935, and 0.989, respectively. The mIOU values of A2C, A3C, and A4C are 0.858, 0.794, and 0.838, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the tastiness of mushroom, this edible fungus often appears in people’s daily meals. Nevertheless, there are still various mushroom species that have not been identified. Thus, the automatic identification of mushroom toxicity is of great value. A number of methods are commonly employed to recognize mushroom toxicity, such as folk experience, chemical testing, animal experiments, and fungal classification, all of which cannot produce quick, accurate results and have a complicated cycle. To solve these problems, in this paper, we proposed an automatic toxicity identification method based on visual features. The proposed method regards toxicity identification as a binary classification problem. First, intuitive and easily accessible appearance data, such as the cap shape and color of mushrooms, were taken as features. Second, the missing data in any of the features were handled in two ways. Finally, three pattern-recognition methods, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and multigrained cascade forest, were used to construct 3 different toxicity classifiers for mushrooms. Compared with the logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers, the multigrained cascade forest classifier had better performance with an accuracy of approximately 98%, enhancing the possibility of preventing food poisoning. These classifiers can recognize the toxicity of mushrooms—even that of some unknown species—according to their appearance features and important social and application value.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shuang Li</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Seog Geun Kang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we investigate new signal constellation pairs for mapping active subcarriers of the zero-padded trimode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (ZTM-OFDM-IM) systems. In the presented system, one of a constellation pair is the same as the one used in the previous work, and the other is a constellation larger than the one used in the previous work. It increases the minimum Euclidean distance between the subblocks of the ZTM-OFDM-IM system with new constellation pairs under the constraint of the same spectral efficiency. Computer simulation in AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels shows that the new ZTM-OFDM-IM system has a much lower bit error rate than OFDM-IM and dual-mode OFDM-IM and slightly outperforms the system with conventional constellation pairs. Since the proposed constellation pairs prove the error performance improvement of the system, it is considered that a further study on generalized design of the constellation pair for the ZTM-OFDM-IM system is necessary in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is suitable for complex environment communication in coal mine. The processes of nutrient flux transfer and path choice in Physarum networks are similar to data transmission and routing decision in MANET. In this paper, we use a Physarum optimization model to design Physarum-inspired autonomous optimized routing (PIAOR) protocol to adapt to the dynamic network topology in underground mine. PIAOR introduces the status of MANET into the Poisson equation in the Physarum model, selects reasonable parameters to represent the transmission performance of the network, and uses the differential evolution equation of the Physarum model to evolve the parameters. PIAOR has achieved the distributed routing decision by automatically reconstructing the optimal routing path, which has reduced the algorithm complexity. Based on NS2, simulation experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of PIAOR, and the results are compared with GPSR, PIMAR, and P-IRP routing algorithms. The experimental results show that the routing path selected by PIAOR is better than that selected by the other three protocols in the performance of average end-to-end delay, delivery ratio, and throughput. The balance of energy consumption and network load is reached, and the network lifetime is effectively prolonged when using the PIAOR protocol.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Girish Kumar Chakravarty</dc:creator>

<dc:creator>Subhendra Mohanty</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We construct a unified model of inflation and PeV dark matter with an appropriate choice of no-scale Kähler potential, superpotential, and gauge kinetic function in terms of MSSM fields and hidden sector Polonyi field. The model is consistent with the CMB observations and can explain the PeV neutrino flux observed at IceCube HESE. A Starobinsky-like Higgs-sneutrino plateau inflation is obtained from the D-term SUGRA potential while F-term being subdominant during inflation. To get PeV dark matter, SUSY breaking at PeV scale is achieved through Polonyi field. This sets the scale for soft SUSY breaking parameters m0,m1/2,A0 at the GUT scale in terms of the parameters of the model. The low-energy particle spectrum is obtained by running the RGEs. We show that the ~125 GeV Higgs and the gauge coupling unification can be obtained in this model. The 6 PeV bino-type dark matter is a subdominant fraction (~11%) of the relic density, and its decay gives the PeV scale neutrino flux observed at IceCube by appropriately choosing the couplings of the R-parity violating operators. Also, we find that there is degeneracy in scalar field parameters γ,β and coupling ζ value in producing the correct amplitude of CMB power spectrum. However, the value of parameter tanβ=1.8, which is tightly fixed from the requirement of PeV scale SUSY breaking, removes the degeneracy in the values of the scalar field parameters to provide a unique solution for inflation. In this way, it brings the explanation for dark matter, PeV neutrinos, and inflation within the same framework.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The mismatch between the supply and demand of online-listed rental housing (ORH) is an important factor restricting the operational efficiency of online rental service platforms. However, extant literature pays little attention to this problem. This study proposes an ORH multiattribute supply and demand matching decision model based on the perceived utility of matching both sides of this market. The model considers the multiattribute information of ORH, such as area, transportation, rent, room, and interior decoration, and quantifies their perceived utility values based on the theory of disappointment. Thereafter, we construct the matching decision model and verify it for feasibility by applying it to Shanghai’s ORH supply and demand information—our empirical case. The results show that this method can be applied to online rental housing platforms and meet the supply and demand matching requirements to the greatest extent. The constructed model takes into account the perceptions of both supply and demand parties, may promote the effective matching of ORH supply and demand, and bears theoretical implications for the improvement of rental housing matching in ORH platforms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mume Fructus (MF) contains a variety of organic acids, free amino acids, and nucleoside components, and studies have not yet analyzed the relationship between the components of free amino acids and nucleosides with the varieties of MF. A rapid and sensitive method was established for simultaneous determination of 21 free amino acids and 9 nucleosides in MF by ultrafast liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analysis was carried out on a Waters XBridge Amide column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 3.5 μm) with elution by the mobile phase of 0.2% aqueous formic acid (A) and 0.2% formic acid acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min with 1 μL per injection. The column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The target compounds were analyzed by the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The comprehensive evaluation of the samples was carried out by principal component analysis (PCA) and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) analysis. Results showed the method could simultaneously determine 30 components in MF. The content of total analytes in six mainstream varieties was different, exhibited the order Nangao &gt; Daqingmei &gt; Zhaoshuimei &gt; Yanmei &gt; Shishengme &gt; Baimei, and aspartic acid and adenosine were the most abundant amino acid and nucleoside. PCA and OPLS-DA could easily distinguish the samples, and 11 components could be chemical markers of sample classification. TOPSIS implied that the quality of Nangao and Daqingmei was superior to the other varieties. The results could provide a reliable basis for quality evaluation and utilisation of medicinal and edible MF.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for human serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was established by a competition model. In serum, more than 99% of total circulating 25(OH)D binds to protein and less than 1% of 25(OH)D is in free form (Jassil et al., 2017). Before measuring concentration of 25(OH)D in serum, a releasing procedure should be conducted. A new reagent is used to release binding 25(OH)D to free form. Streptavidin (SA) was labeled to magnetic beads by a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) method. Biotinylated VD was used as a competitor of 25(OH)D in samples. Anti-VD antibody (aby) was labeled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by EDC to react with 25(OH)D and biotinylated-VD molecules. The pretreated samples or standards were added into the reaction tube with biotin-VD and anti-VD aby-HRP, free 25(OH)D in the sample competes with biotinylated VD for binding to anti-VD aby-HRP, an SA-labeled magnetic particle is added to isolate the signal-generating complex, and the signal is inversely proportional to the 25(OH)D concentration in the sample. The method established shows good thermostability and performance. The limitation of detection (LoD) is 1.43 ng/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) is 3.66%–6.56%, the interassay CV is 4.19%–7.01%, and the recovery rate is 93.22%–107.99%. Cross-reactivity (CR) was remarkably low with vitamin D2, vitamin D3, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D2. At the same time, the cross-reaction values with 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were 97% and 100%, respectively. The developed method shows good correlation with the total VD product from Roche and DiaSorin. 1096 clinical patient samples were measured with developed reagent kit in this study. 7 types of disease were involved, and the concentration of 25(OH)D is less than 30 ng/mL in 94.98% of patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The development of sensitive, cheap, and portable methods for detecting nitroaromatics explosives has a profound significance and value for public health and environmental protection. For this purpose, a new D-π-A barbituric acid derivative CB-CYH with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behavior was synthesized, which can interact with picric acid through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate that the enhanced emission of the compounds is related to the formation of nano-aggregates. It is well known that an important source of mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF) characteristic materials is the compound with AIE characteristics. The chemosensing test paper prepared by aggregated nanoparticles based on AIE properties is often subjected to external friction or squeeze during transportation or storage, resulting in changes of their optical properties, and destruction of test paper followed. Therefore, the development of compounds with AIE properties and stable optical properties in the presence of external stimuli is particularly important for chemosensing test paper. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) shows that the presence of hydrophobic cycloalkyl group in CB-CYH, which caused the molecules to be closely interspersed with each other; hence, it is difficult to change the microstructure and stacking mode of molecules by external stimulation simultaneously; the optical properties are not changed by external stimuli. Therefore, the test paper based on the AIE effect of CB-CYH was developed as chemosensing test paper for the detection of nitroaromatics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Anthropometric adiposity measures (AAMs) such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are used to evaluate obesity status. Country-specific cutoff values of AAMs would provide more accurate estimation of obesity prevalence. This cross-sectional study was designed to determine the optimal cutoff values for AAMs, BMI, WC, hip circumference (HC), and WHR, of Sri Lankan adult women. The study was conducted in Galle, Sri Lanka, with 350 healthy community-dwelling middle-aged women aged 30–60 years, divided into two groups (Group A, n = 175 and Group B, n = 175). Total body fat percentage (TBFP) (kg) was measured with DXA. Body weight (kg), height (m), and WC and HC (cm) were measured. BMI (kg/m2) and WHR were calculated. Optimal cutoff values were determined by area under curve (AUC) in Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using TBFP as the criterion at the TBFP level of 33% and 35% using the women in Group A. Then, the prevalence of obesity was determined in Group B while comparing the prevalence based on the cutoff values recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Asians and the newly developed cutoff values for Sri Lankan women. Optimal cutoff values of AAMs which correspond to TBFP 33% are BMI, 24.5 kg/m2; WC, 80 cm; HC, 95 cm; and WHR, 0.83. TBFP 35% corresponds to the optimal cutoff values of BMI, 25.0 kg/m2; WC, 85 cm; HC, 100 cm; and WHR, 0.83. Prevalence of obesity (number, %) according to the WHO and newly defined cutoff values that correspond to TBFP 33% and 35% were as follows: BMI = 83 (47.4%), 98 (56.0%), 83 (47.4%); WC = 106 (60.6%), 106 (60.6%), 72 (41.1%); and WHR = 140 (80.0%), 106 (60.6%), 106 (60.6%). The observed cutoff values of BMI and WC in this study were within the ranges of those described by the WHO for Asian populations which correspond to the 33% and 35% TBFP levels, respectively. However, the WHR cutoff value of WHO (Asians) is lower when compared to the newly determined value for Sri Lankan females while overestimating the prevalence. More studies are needed to confirm these values before clinical use.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The service quality of public transit, such as comfort and convenience, is an important factor influencing ridership and fare revenue, which also reflects the passengers’ perception to the transit performance. Passengers are frustrated while waiting to board a crowded train especially during the peak hours, while the fail-to-board (FtB) situation commonly exists. The service performance measures determined by deterministic passenger demand and service frequency cannot reflect the perceived service of passengers. With the automatic fare collection system data provided by Chengdu Metro, we develop a data-driven approach considering the joint probability of spatiotemporal passenger demand at stations based on posted train schedule to approximate passenger travel time (e.g., in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle times). It was found that the estimated wait time can reflect the actual situation as passengers FtB. The proposed modeling approach and analysis results would be useful and beneficial for transit providers to improve system performance and service planning.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Computer security incident response teams typically rely on threat intelligence platforms for information about sightings of cyber threat events and indicators of compromise. Other security building blocks, such as Network Intrusion Detection Systems, can leverage the information to prevent malicious adversaries from spreading malware across critical infrastructures. The effectiveness of threat intelligence platforms heavily depends on the willingness to share among organizations and the responsible use of sensitive information that may potentially harm the reputation of the reporting organization. The challenge that we address is the lack of trust in the source providing the threat intelligence and the information itself. We enhance our security framework TATIS—offering fine-grained protection for threat intelligence platform APIs—with distributed ledger capabilities to enable reliable and trustworthy threat intelligence sharing with the ability to audit the provenance of threat intelligence. We have implemented and evaluated the feasibility of our distributed framework on top of the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) solution, and we evaluate the performance impact using real-world open-source threat intelligence feeds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of the most challenging issues confronting social media operators is how to increase users’ activity and self-disclosure behaviour. However, more and more users are lowering their disclosures on social media, such as WeChat in China. Using social cognitive theory as a starting point while utilizing mobile instant messaging software WeChat as an example, this paper studies the dynamics that influence users’ self-disclosure behaviour on WeChat from two aspects: individual factors and environment factors. A structural equation model is used to verify a conceptual model. The results show that, firstly, mobile users’ self-disclosure behaviour on WeChat can be affected by both individual factors and environment factors. Specifically, individual factors, such as privacy concerns, negatively affect users’ self-disclosure behaviour, while environmental factors, such as social influences, positively affect users’ self-disclosure behaviour. More importantly, the research points to significant differences in self-disclosure behaviour between mobile users of different genders and ages. As such, the conclusions of this paper should provide key information for optimized operation of WeChat and other mobile information systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigates the geographically weighted multivariate logistic regression (GWMLR) model, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing procedures. The GWMLR model is an extension to the multivariate logistic regression (MLR) model, which has dependent variables that follow a multinomial distribution along with parameters associated with the spatial weighting at each location in the study area. The parameter estimation was done using the maximum likelihood estimation and Newton-Raphson methods, and the maximum likelihood ratio test was used for hypothesis testing of the parameters. The performance of the GWMLR model was evaluated using a real dataset and it was found to perform better than the MLR model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Because deep neural networks (DNNs) are both memory-intensive and computation-intensive, they are difficult to apply to embedded systems with limited hardware resources. Therefore, DNN models need to be compressed and accelerated. By applying depthwise separable convolutions, MobileNet can decrease the number of parameters and computational complexity with less loss of classification precision. Based on MobileNet, 3 improved MobileNet models with local receptive field expansion in shallow layers, also called Dilated-MobileNet (Dilated Convolution MobileNet) models, are proposed, in which dilated convolutions are introduced into a specific convolutional layer of the MobileNet model. Without increasing the number of parameters, dilated convolutions are used to increase the receptive field of the convolution filters to obtain better classification accuracy. The experiments were performed on the Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and Tubingen animals with attribute datasets, respectively. The results show that Dilated-MobileNets can obtain up to 2% higher classification accuracy than MobileNet.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Immunization strategies on complex networks are effective methods to control the spreading dynamics on complex networks, which change the topology and connectivity of the underlying network, thereby affecting the dynamics process of propagation. Here, we use a non-Markovian threshold model to study the impact of immunization strategies on social contagions, in which the immune index greater than (or equal to) 0 corresponds to targeted (random) immunization, and when the immune index is less than 0, the probability of an individual being immunized is inversely related to the degree of the individual. A generalized edge-based compartmental theory is developed to analyze the dynamics of social contagions under immunization, and theoretical predictions are very consistent with simulation results. We find that increasing the immune index or increasing the immune ratio will reduce the final adoption size and increase the outbreak threshold, in other words, make the residual network after immunization not conducive to social contagions. Interestingly, enhancing the network heterogeneity is proved to help improve the immune efficiency of targeted immunization. Besides, the dependence of the outbreak threshold on the network heterogeneity is correlated with the immune ratio and immune index.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper captures the RMB exchange rate volatility using the Markov-switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models and traditional single-regime GARCH models. Through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the model parameters are estimated to study the volatility dynamics of the RMB exchange rate. Furthermore, we compare the MSGARCH models to the single-regime GARCH specifications in terms of Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction accuracy. According to the Deviance information criterion method, the research shows that MSGARCH models outperform the single-regime specifications in capturing the complexity of RMB exchange rate volatility. After the RMB exchange rate reform in 2015, the volatility is more asymmetric and persistent, and the probability of being in the turbulent volatility regime is significantly increased. The continuous escalation of Sino-US trade friction has increased the VaR of RMB exchange rate log-returns. From the evaluation results of the actual over expected exceedance ratio (AE), the conditional coverage (CC) test, and the dynamic quantile (DQ) test, we find strong evidence that two-regime MSGARCH models could forecast VaR more accurately, which provides practical value for China’s foreign exchange management authorities to manage the financial risk.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yan Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yonghong Wu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Health insurance is considered to be a special type of nonlife insurance with two important features. First, compared with property insurance, health insurance provides valuable hedge against unpredictable shocks to health status, instead of loss on property. Therefore, a modified utility function that describes the trade-off between health and wealth should be applied in optimal indemnity design. Second, in the case that the insured is severely or critically ill, with necessary medical treatment, the insured may not fully recover from an illness or an injury. The doctor usually communicates with the patient to set up a personalized treatment plan and explains clearly about the expected outcome beforehand. Hence, there is some probability that health insurance helps to rescue the insured from disastrous financial burden, but it still yields a lower utility of health. By taking these special features into account, we formulate the optimization problem and characterize the optimal solutions via the Lagrange multiplier method and optimal control technique. Finally, we examine our optimal contracts by numerical illustration. Our research work gives new insights into health insurance design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A targeted ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was established and validated for the simultaneous determination of 34 amino acids in tissue samples from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm, 5 μm) with a binary gradient elution system (A, 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid and 0.2% formic acid in water, v/v; B, methanol). The run time was 10 min. The multiple reaction monitoring mode was chosen with an electrospray ionization source operating in the positive ionization mode for data acquisition. The linear correlation coefficients were &gt;0.99 for all the analytes in their corresponding calibration ranges. The sample was pretreated based on tissue homogenate and protein precipitation with a 100 mg aliquot sample. The average recovery and matrix effect for 34 amino acids and 3 internal standards were 39.00%∼146.95% and 49.45%∼173.63%, respectively. The intra- and interday accuracy for all the analytes ranged from −13.52% to 14.21% (RSD ≤8.57%) and from −14.52% to 12.59% (RSD ≤10.31%), respectively. Deviations of stability under different conditions were within ±15% for all the analytes. This method was applied to simultaneous quantification of 34 amino acids in tissue samples from 94 CRC patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to improve the working efficiency of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and the processing efficiency of fulfilling orders in intelligent warehouses, a novel parallel ant colony optimization algorithm for warehouse path planning is proposed. Through the interaction of pheromones among multiple subcolonies, the coevolution of multiple subcolonies is realized and the operational capability of the algorithm is improved. Then, a multiobjective function with the object of the shortest path and the minimum number of turns of the AGV is established. And the path satisfying this objective function is obtained by the proposed algorithm. In addition, the path is further smoothed by reducing the number of intermediate nodes. The results show that the stability and convergence rate of the algorithm are faster and more stable, compared to other algorithms, in generating paths for different complexity maps. The smoothing treatment of the path significantly reduces the number of turns and the path length in the AGV driving process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to optimize the passenger train working diagram and improve the passenger satisfaction towards a coordinated optimization problem of departure time domains of multiple passenger trains at a station, the optimization model is designed to maximize the overall passenger travel satisfaction based on the quantification of the level of passenger travel satisfaction. The simulated annealing algorithm is then used to solve the model. Finally, 23 pairs of passenger trains from Chengdu Railway Station are selected as examples to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm. The result shows that the model and algorithm proposed in this paper can realize the coordinated optimization of the departure time of multiple trains at a station while considering the passengers’ travel satisfaction, which can provide an effective reference for the compilation of passenger train working diagram.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this article, a new approach is used to introduce an additional parameter to a continuous class of distributions. The new class is referred to as a new extended-F family of distributions. The new extended-Weibull distribution, as a special submodel of this family, is discussed. General expressions for some mathematical properties of the proposed family are derived, and maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters are obtained. Furthermore, a simulation study is provided to evaluate the validity of the maximum likelihood estimators. Finally, the flexibility of the proposed method is illustrated via two applications to real data, and the comparison is made with the Weibull and some of its well-known extensions such as Marshall–Olkin Weibull, alpha power-transformed Weibull, and Kumaraswamy Weibull distributions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In high density urban areas, pedestrians have a great influence on the capacity of intersections. This paper studies the influence of pedestrians on road capacity and proposes an exclusive right-turn lane capacity model considering pedestrian-vehicle interaction (PV-RTC). Firstly, a pedestrian-vehicle interaction (PVI) model is proposed based on the logit model and static games theory of incomplete information. Through this model, the probability of 6 kinds of pedestrian-vehicle interaction situations (vehicles yield to pedestrians, pedestrians yield to vehicles, etc.) in the crosswalk can be obtained. Then, based on the basic idea of the stop line method and the probabilities of above situations, the PV-RTC model is established, and the sensitivity analysis of the important factors (pedestrian arrival rate, yielding rate, and green time ratio) affecting the model is carried out to clarify the mechanism of the proposed model. Finally, a pedestrian-vehicle interaction model of cellular automata for the exclusive right-turn lane is established and its simulation results are compared with the results of the PV-RTC model. The results show that the relative error between the microscopic simulation model and PV-RTC model is less than 15% overall, which verifies the validity of the PV-RTC model. This study provides references for a more precise estimation method of pedestrian impact on road capacity.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Qiang Hu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jiaji Shen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Some cloud services may be invalid since they are located in a dynamically changing network environment. Service substitution is necessary when a cloud service cannot be used. Existing work mainly concerned on service function and quality in service substitution. To select a more suitable substitutive service, process collaboration similarity needs to be considered. This paper proposes a cluster and process collaboration-aware method to achieve service substitution. To compute the process collaboration similarity, we use logic Petri nets to model service processes. All the service processes are transformed into path strings. Service vectors for cloud services are generated by Word2Vec from these path strings. Process collaboration similarity of two cloud services is obtained by computing the cosine value of their service vectors. Meanwhile, similar cloud services are classified as a service cluster. By calculating function similarity and quality matching, a candidate set for services substitution is generated. The service with the highest process collaboration similarity to invalid one in the candidate set is chosen as the substitutive one. Simulation experiments show the proposed method is less time-consuming than traditional methods in finding substitutive service. Meanwhile, the substitutive one has a high cooccurrence rate with neighboring services of the invalid cloud service. Thus, the proposed method is efficient and integrates process collaboration well in service substitution.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Magdi Mansour Salih</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mycetoma is a lifelong granulomatous disease of subcutaneous tissues and bones. Histopathology is a substantiated indicative method based on the assumption of a definitive diagnosis of mycetoma. It requires efficient processing of tissues including bone decalcification. The decalcification process must ensure complete removal of calcium and also a proper preservation of tissue and microorganisms’ staining ability. Objectives. To compare the conventional method used in decalcification with the microwave method using different decalcification solutions. Different characteristics were tested, including the speed of decalcification and morphological and fungal preservation in bone tissue affected with mycetoma. Materials and Methods. Three decalcification solutions were employed to remove calcium from 50 bone tissue samples affected with mycetoma, including 10% neutral buffered EDTA (pH 7.4), 5% nitric acid, and 5% hydrochloric acid. Conventional and microwave methods were used. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain, Gridley’s stain, and Grocott hexamine-silver stain were employed to evaluate the bone and fungi morphologies. Results. The decalcification time of the conventional method compared with the microwave method with 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) took 120 hours and 29 hours, while 5% hydrochloric acid and 5% nitric acid took 8 hours and 3 hours, separately. Also, 10% EDTA is the best decalcifying agent for HE staining and fungal stains. 5% hydrochloric acid and 5% nitric acid can be used for fungal staining. Conclusion. The current study investigated the effects of different decalcifying agents as well as two decalcification procedures on the preservation of the bone structure and fungal staining, which will help to develop suitable protocols for the analyses of the bone tissue affected with mycetoma infection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To evaluate pharmacological activities of a novel fungus Hygrophoropsis sp., the influence of aeration rate on the production of mycelial biomass, exopolysaccharides (EPS), and intrapolysaccharides (IPS) in the fungus Hygrophoropsis sp. was investigated. And the water extracts of cultured Hygrophoropsis sp. mycelia and the fermentation broth were analyzed for their antioxidation activity by using four different assay methods such as hydroxyl radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and reducing power. The Hygrophoropsis sp. was cultivated under various aeration rates in a 7 l bioreactor. The highest mycelial biomass (3.98 mg/mL) and IPS production (19.63 mg/g) were obtained at aeration rate 4.5 v.v.m. The results showed that Hygrophoropsis sp., in general, possesses a strong antioxidation activity in all assays tested. The deproteinized extracts had stronger antioxidation activity as compared to the un-deproteinized extracts by using superoxide radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and reducing power. Besides, the un-deproteinized extracts had stronger antioxidation activity as compared to the deproteinized extracts by using hydroxyl radical scavenging. Thus, the polysaccharide extractions from the Hygrophoropsis sp. studied have antioxidant activities in vitro, which may be a good source of natural antioxidants or further investigation as potential natural antioxidants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Computer vision is one of the hottest research fields in deep learning. The emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs) provides a new method and model for computer vision. The idea of GANs using the game training method is superior to traditional machine learning algorithms in terms of feature learning and image generation. GANs are widely used not only in image generation and style transfer but also in the text, voice, video processing, and other fields. However, there are still some problems with GANs, such as model collapse and uncontrollable training. This paper deeply reviews the theoretical basis of GANs and surveys some recently developed GAN models, in comparison with traditional GAN models. The applications of GANs in computer vision include data enhancement, domain transfer, high-quality sample generation, and image restoration. The latest research progress of GANs in artificial intelligence (AI) based security attack and defense is introduced. The future development of GANs in computer vision is also discussed at the end of the paper with possible applications of AI in computer vision.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the rapid development of e-commerce and the economy, an increasing number of retailers are adopting a dual-channel retail strategy (DCRS), which allows customers to return unsatisfactory products, provided that their complaints are reasonable, and receive a full refund. This paper studies the pricing strategies of an integrated dual-channel retailer (DCR) when it provides return policies to customers, including original channel return, fixed cross-channel return, and relaxed cross-channel return. The relationship between the DCR’s system performance and channel pricing is impacted by customer channel preferences, and the return rates of different channels are discussed. The results show that the greater the difference in customer preferences between channels is, the greater the profitability of the DCR will be. A fixed cross-channel return model should be selected when the return rate in the online channel is higher or the cross-channel return rate is lower; otherwise, the original channel return model should be selected. When the return rate of a certain channel is high, the retailer should increase the price in that channel and reduce the pricing of its competing channel to compensate for the loss caused by the returns and transfer sales between channels. A selective return policy can not only improve the flexibility of business operations and enhance competitive advantage but also provide convenient customer returns and enhance consumers’ sense of security.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Agarwood is generally used to make incense sticks in China and Southeast Asia. It emits smoke with a pleasant odor when burned. There are few reports on the chemical components of smoke generated by burning or heating agarwood. The agarwoods were produced by the whole-tree agarwood-inducing technique (AWIT), agarwood induced by axe wounds (AAW), burning-chisel-drilling agarwood (BCDA), wood of Aquilaria sinensis trees (AS), respectively. Herein, we used GC-MS to analyze the chemical constituents of incense smoke generated from AWIT, AAW, BCDA, AS, and the extracts of sticks from agarwood produced by the whole-tree agarwood-inducing technique (EAWIT), and 484 compounds were identified. A total of 61 chemical constituents were shared among AWIT, AAW, and BCDA. The experimental data showed that aromatic compounds were the main chemical constituents in agarwood smoke and that some chromone derivatives could be cracked into low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds (LACs) at high temperature. Furthermore, agarwood incense smoke showed anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced TNF-α and IL-1α release in RAW264.7 cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For large-scale rapid-decompression experiments, a new door-triggering mechanism is proposed for a 750 mm diameter pressure relief channel. Quick opening of the door is realized by utilizing a spring-based release mechanism to instantly convert large amounts of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy. To counteract the significant inertial effect of the high-speed door on the chamber, a flywheel-based cushioning mechanism is designed to absorb the kinetic energy of the door after opening. This carefully designed mechanism consists of the closing mechanism, energy storage unit, locking/releasing mechanism, and cushioning mechanism. Kinetic models are established to analyze the dynamic properties. Simulation results reveal that it takes approximately 280 ms for the door to open from 0° to 90°. This work can provide insights for the development of large-scale rapid-decompression equipment in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Haileyesus Tessema Alemneh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, a nonlinear deterministic model for the dynamics of corruption is proposed and analysed qualitatively using the stability theory of differential equations. The basic reproduction number with respect to the corruption-free equilibrium is obtained using next-generation matrix method. The conditions for local and global asymptotic stability of corruption-free and endemic equilibria are established. From the analysis using center manifold theory, the model exhibits forward bifurcation. Then, the model was extended by reformulating it as an optimal control problem, with the use of two time-dependent controls to assess the impact of corruption on human population, namely, campaigning about corruption through media and advertisement and exposing corrupted individuals to jail and giving punishment. By using Pontryagin’s maximum principle, necessary conditions for the optimal control of the transmission of corruption were derived. From the numerical simulation, it was found that the integrated control strategy must be taken to fight against corruption.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are in different stages of clinical trials for stroke patients. MSCs are proposed to promote recovery through the release of secretomes that modulate the function of beneficial immune cells. The majority of stroke patients have comorbidities including hypertension, for which they are prescribed antihypertensive medications that might affect the function of MSCs, when they are administered in stroke patients. Here, we studied the effects of common antihypertensive medications on the secretomes of human MSCs and their modulation of human monocytes (Mo) derived from stroke patients. MTT assay was used to assess the proliferation of MSCs after they were exposed to increased levels of antihypertensive medications. MSCs were exposed to the following medications: atenolol, captopril, and losartan. Monocytes were isolated from stroke patients with NIHSS ranging from 11 to 20 and from healthy controls. MSC-Mo cocultures were established, and a secretome profile was analyzed using the Magpix Multiplex cytokine array from Luminex technology. The linear mixed-effect model was used for statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. At clinically relevant levels, there was no change in MSC proliferation after exposure to atenolol, captopril, or losartan. Atenolol increased IL-1RA in stroke-Mo and decreased IL-8 secretion from MSCs indicating an anti-inflammatory effect of atenolol on secretomes of these cells. Captopril increased IL-8 from stroke-Mo and increased IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 secretions from MSCs. Captopril also increased IL-6 secretion from cocultures of stroke-Mo and MSCs indicating a strong proinflammatory effect on MSCs and their interaction with Mo. Atenolol increased the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 while captopril increased the secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 from MSCs. Losartan decreased the release of IL-6 from MSCs. Losartan reduced MCP-1 and TNF-α from stroke-Mo and reduced IL-8 from cocultures of stroke-Mo and MSCs. Our results show that antihypertensive medications such as atenolol, captopril, and losartan, at concentrations comparable to doses prescribed for patients hospitalized for acute stroke, modulate the secretome profile of MSCs and their modulatory effects on target immune cells. Our results suggest that stroke trials involving the use of intravenous MSCs should consider the effect of these antihypertensive drugs administered to stroke patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Reasonable deployment of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) lanes which separating the heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) can not only improve traffic safety but also greatly improve the overall roadway efficiency. This paper simplified CAV lane deployment plan into the problem of traffic network design and proposed a comprehensive decision-making method for CAV lane deployment plan. Based on the traffic equilibrium theory, this method aims to reduce the travel cost of the traffic network and the management cost of CAV lanes using a bilevel primary-secondary programming model. In addition, the upper level is the decision-making scheme of the lane deployment, while the lower level is the traffic assignment model including CAV and HV modes based on the decision-making scheme of the upper level. After that, a genetic algorithm was designed to solve the model. Finally, a medium-scaled traffic network was selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The case study shows that the proposed method obtained a feasible scheme for lane deployment considering from both the system travel cost and management cost of CAV lanes. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the market penetration rate of CAVs, traffic demand, and the capacity of CAVLs further proves the applicability of this model, which can achieve better allocation of system resources and also improve the traffic efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the increasing of depth and complexity of the convolutional neural network, parameter dimensionality and volume of computing have greatly restricted its applications. Based on the SqueezeNet network structure, this study introduces a block convolution and uses channel shuffle between blocks to alleviate the information jam. The method is aimed at reducing the dimensionality of parameters of in an original network structure and improving the efficiency of network operation. The verification performance of the ORL dataset shows that the classification accuracy and convergence efficiency are not reduced or even slightly improved when the network parameters are reduced, which supports the validity of block convolution in structure lightweight. Moreover, using a classic CIFAR-10 dataset, this network decreases parameter dimensionality while accelerating computational processing, with excellent convergence stability and efficiency when the network accuracy is only reduced by 1.3%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Employing the concept and function of tangency with similarity measures and counterpart distances for reliable medical consultations has been extensively studied in the past decades and results in lots of isomorphic measures for application. We compared the majority of such isomorphic measures proposed by various researchers and classified them into (a) maximum norm and (b) one-norm categories. Moreover, we found that previous researchers used monotonic functions to transform an identity function and resulted in complicated expressions. In this study, we provide a theoretical foundation to explain the isomorphic nature of a newer measure proposed by the following research paper against its studied existing one in deriving the same pattern recognition results. Specifically, this study initially proposes two similarity measures using maximum norm, arithmetic mean, and aggregation operators and followed by a detailed discussion on their mathematical characteristics. Subsequently, a simplified version of such measures is presented for easy application. This study completely covers two previous methods to point out that the complex approaches used were unnecessary. The findings will help physicians, patients, and their family members to obtain a proper medical diagnosis during multiple examinations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The differential diagnosis of subcentimetre lung nodules with a diameter of less than 1 cm has always been one of the problems of imaging doctors and thoracic surgeons. We plan to create a deep learning model for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in a simple method. Methods. Image data and pathological diagnosis of patients come from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from October 1, 2016, to October 1, 2019. After data preprocessing and data augmentation, the training set is used to train the model. The test set is used to evaluate the trained model. At the same time, the clinician will also diagnose the test set. Results. A total of 2,295 images of 496 lung nodules and their corresponding pathological diagnosis were selected as a training set and test set. After data augmentation, the number of training set images reached 12,510 images, including 6,648 malignant nodular images and 5,862 benign nodular images. The area under the P-R curve of the trained model is 0.836 in the classification of malignant and benign nodules. The area under the ROC curve of the trained model is 0.896 (95% CI: 78.96%~100.18%), which is higher than that of three doctors. However, the P value is not less than 0.05. Conclusion. With the help of an automatic machine learning system, clinicians can create a deep learning pulmonary nodule pathology classification model without the help of deep learning experts. The diagnostic efficiency of this model is not inferior to that of the clinician.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Food insecurity and HIV/AIDS are intertwined in a vicious cycle through nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways. Food insecurity is a potentially important barrier to the success of antiretroviral treatment, increased hospitalizations, and higher morbidity among HIV-infected individuals in resource-poor settings particularly in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of food insecurity among people living with HIV/AIDS on follow up at public hospitals of western Ethiopia. Methods. An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on a sample of 428 among people living with HIV/AIDS on follow up at public hospitals of western Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to include all participants. Data was collected using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. The data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and then exported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences window version 21 for analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed. Bivariable logistic and multivariable logistic analyses were used with AOR at CI 95% and p&lt;0.05 were used. Result. The finding of the study revealed that the majority of the respondents 221(53.1%) were female. The mean age of the respondents was 32.92±7.304 years and 197 (47.4%) of the study participants were between 30 to 39 years’ age group. The level of food insecurity among PLWHA receiving ART therapy was 68.8% which was partitioned as mild (23.32%), moderate (29.09%), and severe (16.35%) food in secured. Being single [AOR=3.5071.377,8.934], illiterate [AOR=5.2341.747,15.686], cigarette smoking [AOR=3.5772.104,6.081], presence of anemia (AOR=2.6501.563,4.493], and inadequate dietary diversity [AOR=2.8701.088,7.569] were predictors of food insecurity. Conclusion. The prevalence of food insecurity was high. Educational status, marital status, cigarette smoking, presence of anemia, opportunistic infection, and inadequate dietary diversity were the major significant factors affecting food insecurity. We recommended a national health policy maker to integrate food and nutrition interventions as part of a package of care, treatment, and support services for people living with HIV and ART follower patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Morale can be viewed as a future-oriented optimism or pessimism regarding challenges associated with aging and is closely related to subjective well-being. Promoting morale in old age could be considered to have important implications for aging well, and increased knowledge about morale in different stages of old age is needed. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with morale in different age groups among old people. Data were derived from a survey conducted in 2016, as a part of the Gerontological Regional Database (GERDA). The sample consisted of 9,047 individuals aged between 65 and 86 years from Ostrobothnia and Southern Ostrobothnia in Finland, and Västerbotten in Sweden. Morale was measured with the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) and regressed upon a number of sociodemographic, social, and health-related factors using linear regression analyses. The results showed that older age was an independent factor explaining lower level of morale. Additionally, the sociodemographic, social, and health-related variables could explain a large proportion of the variance in morale. Perceived loneliness, having gone through a crisis in life, poor self-rated health, and depression were associated with lower morale, and sleeping well with higher morale, in all age groups. Furthermore, the oldest age groups seem to be more exposed to several risk factors of lower morale identified in this study. Multidimensional interventions targeting especially social and mental health and the oldest-old could therefore be recommended.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To explore the therapeutic effects and mechanism of fluorescent mitoxantrone hydrochloride nanoparticles on giant cell tumor of bone. Methods. The adsorption capacity of nanoparticles to hydroxyapatite (HA), cell adsorption capacity, encapsulation rate, particle size, and potential of the nanoparticles were determined by HPLC and Zetasizer Nano ZS nanomicelle potentiometer. MTT assay was used to determine the toxicity of nanoparticles to cells. The fluorescent intensity of the nanoparticles and their location in the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were then used to measure the expression levels of miRNA, mRNA, and proteins in cells. Transwell and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining tests were used to study the cell invasion and apoptotic rate, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment was then carried out to verify the binding relationship between miR-125b and its predicted target. Results. ALN-FOL-MTO-NLC nanoparticles showed a stronger adsorption capacity for HA and stronger toxicity to GCTB28 cells. Compared to normal tissues, the expression level of miR-125b in giant bone tumor tissue and cells was significantly downregulated, and the expression level of miR-125b was upregulated to some extent after treatment. Overexpression of miR-125b or treatment of ALN-FOL-MTO-NLC nanoparticles can inhibit the malignant behavior of GCTB28 cells, whereas the inhibition of the expression of miR-125b can promote the malignant behavior of GCTB28 cells. The result showed that parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) was a downstream target gene for miR-125b. Rescue experiment showed that the treatment of GCTB28 with ALN-FOL-MTO-NLC nanoparticles while inhibiting miR-125b expression can reduce the inhibitory effect of miR-125b on the malignant behavior of GCTB28 cells, whereas upregulating the expression levels of miR-125b and PTH1R in GCTB28 cells had no significant effect on the malignant behavior of GCTB28 cells. Conclusion. ALN-FOL-MTO-NLC nanoparticles have a certain inhibitory effect on the malignant behavior of giant cell tumor of bone through the miR-125b/PTH1R molecular axis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is regarded as a potential method for recovery in stroke. The effectiveness of taVNS in acute and subacute stroke should be further discussed as previously, only a few small-scale trials have focused on chronic stroke patients. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect and safety of taVNS on upper limb motor function in subacute ischemic stroke patients. Methods. Twenty-one subacute ischemia stroke patients with single upper limb motor function impairment were enrolled and randomly assigned to conventional rehabilitation training with real or sham taVNS, delivered for 15 consecutive days. Electrodes were fixed to the cymba conchae of the left ear with or without electrical stimulation. Conventional rehabilitation training was performed immediately after the end of real or sham taVNS by the same therapists. Baseline assessments were performed on day 0 of enrollment, and posttreatment evaluations were performed at 15 days, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after the first intervention. The assessment included the upper limb Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA-U), the Wolf motor function test (WMFT), the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), and Brunnstrom stage. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were measured before and after each taVNS intervention. At the same time, any adverse effects were observed during the procedure. Outcomes were assessed by a blind evaluator. Results. There were no significant differences in FMA-U, WMFT, FIM, and Brunnstrom scores between the two groups at baseline (P&gt;0.05). At the endpoint, the FMA-U, WMFT, and FIM scores were significantly higher than before treatment (P&lt;0.05), and there was a significantly greater improvement of those measurements in taVNS group compared with sham-taVNS group (P&lt;0.05). Significant improvements in FMA-U score were found between groups at follow-up. Only one case of skin redness occurred during the study. Conclusions. This study revealed that taVNS appeared to be beneficial to the recovery of upper limb motor function in subacute ischemia stroke patients without obvious adverse effects. Trial registration. This trial is registered with ChiCTR1800019635 on 20 November 2018 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=32961).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cerebral ischemia is a common cerebrovascular condition which often induces neuronal apoptosis, leading to brain damage. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway has been reported to be involved in ischemic stroke, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that expressions of Shh, Ptch, and Gli-1 were significantly downregulated at 24 h following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury in neurons in vitro, effects which were associated with increasing numbers of apoptotic cells and reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, expressions of synaptic proteins (neuroligin and neurexin) were significantly downregulated at 8 h following OGD, also associated with concomitant neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with purmorphamine, a Shh agonist, increased Gli-1 in the nucleus of neurons and protected against OGD injury, whereas the Shh inhibitor, cyclopamine, produced the opposite effects. Activation of Shh signals promoted CREB and Akt phosphorylation; upregulated the expressions of BDNF, neuroligin, and neurexin; and decreased NF-κB phosphorylation following OGD. Notably, this activation of Shh signals was accompanied by improved neurobehavioral responses along with attenuations in edema and apoptosis at 48 h postischemic insult in rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of the Shh signaling pathway played a neuroprotective role in response to ischemic exposure via promotion of synaptic and neuronal health.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aim. The present study compared the acute effects of aerobic (AER), resistance (RES), and combined (COM) exercises on blood pressure (BP) levels in people with resistant hypertension (RH) and nonresistant hypertension (NON-RH). Methods. Twenty patients (10 RH and 10 NON-RH) were recruited and randomly performed three exercise sessions and a control session. Ambulatory BP was monitored over 24 hours after each experimental session. Results. Significant reductions on ambulatory BP were found in people with RH after AER, RES, and COM sessions. Notably, ambulatory BP was reduced during awake-time and night-time periods after COM. On the other hand, the effects of AER were more prominent during awake periods, while RES caused greater reductions during the night-time period. In NON-RH, only RES acutely reduced systolic BP, while diastolic BP was reduced after all exercise sessions. However, the longest postexercise ambulatory hypotension was observed after AER (~11 h) in comparison to RES (~8 h) and COM (~4 h) exercises. Conclusion. Findings of the present study indicate that AER, RES, and COM exercises elicit systolic and diastolic postexercise ambulatory hypotension in RH patients. Notably, longer hypotension periods were observed after COM exercise. In addition, NON-RH and RH people showed different changes on BP after exercise sessions, suggesting that postexercise hypotension is influenced by the pathophysiological bases of hypertension.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ransomware (RW) is a distinctive variety of malware that encrypts the files or locks the user’s system by keeping and taking their files hostage, which leads to huge financial losses to users. In this article, we propose a new model that extracts the novel features from the RW dataset and performs classification of the RW and benign files. The proposed model can detect a large number of RW from various families at runtime and scan the network, registry activities, and file system throughout the execution. API-call series was reutilized to represent the behavior-based features of RW. The technique extracts fourteen-feature vector at runtime and analyzes it by applying online machine learning algorithms to predict the RW. To validate the effectiveness and scalability, we test 78550 recent malign and benign RW and compare with the random forest and AdaBoost, and the testing accuracy is extended at 99.56%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The migration of expelled hydrocarbon from source rock into unconventional tight reservoirs is subject to different pore-scale fluid transport mechanisms as opposed to the conventional counterparts and therefore plays a crucial role in controlling the hydrocarbon distribution and accumulation in the former. One of the different mechanisms is related to the formation of a more viscous boundary layer (BL) of brine, i.e., wetting phase fluid on pore surfaces, giving rise to the so-called BL effect. In this work, a two-phase pore network model (PNM) that considers this BL effect is developed to study the influences of pore-scale characteristics on the oil migration process, manifested through the BL effect in tight-sandstone media. Good agreements are reached between experimentally derived relative permeability curves and predicted ones, by applying this model to the pore-network networks extracted from the same samples. Then, this validated model was used to evaluate the impacts of the following factors on the oil migration process: pore radius, coordination number, aspect ratio, brine viscosity, and wettability. The results show that all factors can influence the oil migration process but at different magnitudes. The applicability and significance of the developed tight oil migration PNM are discussed in this work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Perona-Malik (PM) model is used successfully in image processing to eliminate noise while preserving edges; however, this model has a major drawback: it tends to make the image look blocky. This work proposes to modify the PM model by introducing the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional gradient inside the diffusivity function. Experiments with natural images show that our model can suppress efficiently the blocky effect. Also, our model has good performance in visual quality, high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and lower value of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Despite the research progress in the thoraco-lumbo-pelvic balance, cervical spine balance has only recently gained increasing interest. To our knowledge, there is a lack of research regarding sagittal occipitocervical spine balance restoration following posterior occipitocervical fusion (POCF). Purpose. The primary outcome measure is the evaluation of sagittal cervical alignment roentgenographic parameters and the secondary is the functional outcome (NDI), following POCF for upper (C1 &amp; C2) cervical trauma (UCT) in coexistence with upper cervical spine degeneration. Patients and Methods. Twenty old and elderly patients aged 62 ± 12 years with evident upper cervical degeneration, who received POCF for upper C1 &amp; C2 unstable cervical spine injuries, were included. C2-C7 lordosis, C2-C7 SVA, spinocranial angle (SCA), T1-slope, neck tilt (NT), thorax inlet angle (TIA), cervical tilt (CT), cranial tilt (CrT), and C0-C1 angle were measured. The subfusion angle was used to study the behavior of the unfused cervical segments below fusion. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) was used for the functional outcome evaluation. 29 age-matched individuals were used as controls for radiographic analysis and self-reported functional status comparison. Results. The roentgenographic data were measured 3 and 39 ± 12 months postoperatively. Twelve patients showed no disability, and eight showed mild disability. Postoperatively, the patients stood with less C2-C7 lordosis, SCA, and CT (P&lt;0.02) but with higher NT (P&lt;0.02) in comparison to the controls. The patient’s neck disability (NDI) was increasing as TIA increases (P=0.023). Subfusion angle seems to adapt to C2-C7 lordosis (P&lt;0.0033) and C0-C2 angle (P&lt;0.003) without any changes till the last evaluation. Conclusions. POCF sufficiently restored occipitocervical sagittal balance along with functional outcome similar to controls in adult and elderly individuals with evident upper cervical degeneration. We do not recommend POCF for young active individuals without occipitocervical pathology, but in contrary, we recommend the removal of the spinocranial connection hardware after cervical fusion is completed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the research work of the brain-computer interface and the function of human brain work, the state classification of multitask state fMRI data is a problem. The fMRI signal of the human brain is a nonstationary signal with many noise effects and interference. Based on the commonly used nonstationary signal analysis method, Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT), we propose an improved circle-EMD algorithm to suppress the end effect. The algorithm can extract different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), decompose the fMRI data to filter out low frequency and other redundant noise signals, and more accurately reflect the true characteristics of the original signal. For the filtered fMRI signal, we use three existing different machine learning methods: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN) to achieve effective classification of different task states. The experiment compares the results of these machine learning methods and confirms that the deep neural network has the highest accuracy for task-state fMRI data classification and the effectiveness of the improved circle-EMD algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Random selection of initial centroids (centers) for clusters is a fundamental defect in K-means clustering algorithm as the algorithm’s performance depends on initial centroids and may end up in local optimizations. Various hybrid methods have been introduced to resolve this defect in K-means clustering algorithm. As regards, there are no comparative studies comparing these methods in various aspects, the present paper compared three hybrid methods with K-means clustering algorithm using concepts of genetic algorithm, minimum spanning tree, and hierarchical clustering method. Although these three hybrid methods have received more attention in previous researches, fewer studies have compared their results. Hence, seven quantitative datasets with different characteristics in terms of sample size, number of features, and number of different classes are utilized in present study. Eleven indices of external and internal evaluating index were also considered for comparing the methods. Data indicated that the hybrid methods resulted in higher convergence rate in obtaining the final solution than the ordinary K-means method. Furthermore, the hybrid method with hierarchical clustering algorithm converges to the optimal solution with less iteration than the other two hybrid methods. However, hybrid methods with minimal spanning trees and genetic algorithms may not always or often be more effective than the ordinary K-means method. Therefore, despite the computational complexity, these three hybrid methods have not led to much improvement in the K-means method. However, a simulation study is required to compare the methods and complete the conclusion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of fuzzy Lyapunov functions to study the notion of stability of equilibrium points for fuzzy dynamical systems associated with fuzzy initial value problems, through the principle of Zadeh. Our contribution consists in a qualitative characterization of stability by a study of the trajectories of fuzzy dynamical systems, using auxiliary functions, and they will be called fuzzy Lyapunov functions. And, among the main results that have been proven is that the existence of fuzzy Lyapunov functions is a necessary and sufficient condition for stability. Some examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we made improvement on the conformable fractional derivative. Compared to the original one, the improved conformable fractional derivative can be a better replacement of the classical Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivative in terms of physical meaning. We also gave the definition of the corresponding fractional integral and illustrated the applications of the improved conformable derivative to fractional differential equations by some examples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This descriptive, cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and the 376A ⟶ G, 202G ⟶ A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among HIV patients attending care at a teaching hospital in Ghana and determine how the SNPs affect haematological profile in HIV. A total of 200 HIV-positive Ghanaians were recruited. Venous blood samples were obtained and complete blood count, and G6PD screening and genotyping for the 376A ⟶ G, 202G ⟶ A SNPs were performed. Out of the 200 participants, 13.0% (26/200) were G6PD-deficient based on the methemoglobin reductase technique, with 1.5% (3/200) and 11.5% (23/200) presenting with partial and full enzyme defect, respectively. Among the 13.0% participants with G6PD deficiency, 19.2% (5/26), 30.8% (8/26), and 19.2% (5/26) presented with 376A ⟶ G only (enzyme activity (EA): 1.19 U/g Hb), 202G ⟶A only (EA: 1.41 U/g Hb), and G202/A376 SNPs (EA: 1.14 U/g Hb), respectively. Having the 376A ⟶ G mutation was associated not only with lower red blood cell (RBC) count (3.38 × 106/µL (3.16–3.46) vs 3.95 × 106/µL (3.53–4.41), p = 0.010) but also with higher mean cell volume (MCV) (102.90 (99.40–113.0) vs 91.10 fL (84.65–98.98), p = 0.041) and mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) (33.70 pg (32.70–38.50) vs 30.75 pg (28.50–33.35), p = 0.038), whereas possessing the 202G ⟶ A mutation was associated with higher MCV only (98.90 fL (90.95–102.35) vs 91.10 fL (84.65–98.98), p = 0.041) compared to G6PD nondeficient participants. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency among HIV patients in Kumasi, Ghana, is 13.0% prevalence, comprising 1.5% and 11.5% partial and full enzyme defect, respectively, based on the methemoglobin reductase technique among HIV patients in Ghana. Among G6PD-deficient HIV patients, the prevalence of G202/A376 SNPs is 19.2%. The 376A ⟶ G mutation is associated not only with lower RBC count but also with higher MCV and MCH, whereas the 202G ⟶ A mutation is associated with higher MCV compared to the normal G6PD population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chronic systemic inflammation contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and correlates with the abundance of acute phase response (APR) proteins in the liver and plasma. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers that regulate inflammatory gene transcription. We show that BET inhibition by the small molecule apabetalone reduces APR gene and protein expression in human hepatocytes, mouse models, and plasma from CVD patients. Steady-state expression of serum amyloid P, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and ceruloplasmin, APR proteins linked to CVD risk, is reduced by apabetalone in cultured hepatocytes and in humanized mouse liver. In cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes, apabetalone reduces the expression of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-2-macroglobulin, and serum amyloid P. The latter two are also reduced by apabetalone in the liver of endotoxemic mice. BET knockdown in vitro also counters cytokine-mediated induction of the CRP gene. Mechanistically, apabetalone reduces the cytokine-driven increase in BRD4 BET occupancy at the CRP promoter, confirming that transcription of CRP is BET-dependent. In patients with stable coronary disease, plasma APR proteins CRP, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and fibrinogen γ decrease after apabetalone treatment versus placebo, resulting in a predicted downregulation of the APR pathway and cytokine targets. We conclude that CRP and components of the APR pathway are regulated by BET proteins and that apabetalone counters chronic cytokine signaling in patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Label imbalance is one of the characteristics of multilabel data, and imbalanced data seriously affects the performance of the classifiers. In multilabel classification, resampling methods are mostly used to deal with imbalanced problems. Existing resampling methods balance the data by either undersampling or oversampling, which causes overfitting and information loss. Resampling has a significant impact on the minority labels. Furthermore, the high concurrency of majority labels and minority labels in many instances also affects the performance of classification. In this study, we proposed a bidirectional resampling method to decouple multilabel datasets. On one hand, the concurrency of labels can be reduced by setting termination conditions for decoupling, and on the other hand, the loss of instance information and overfitting can be alleviated by combining oversampling and undersampling. By measuring the minority labels of the instances, the instances that have less impact on minority labels are selected to resample. The number of resampling is limited to keep the original distribution of the data during the resampling phase. The experiments on seven benchmark multilabel datasets have proved the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially on datasets with high concurrency of majority labels and minority labels.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Polymerized-type I collagen (polymerized-collagen) is a downregulator of inflammation and a tissue regenerator. The aim was to evaluate the effect of intra-articular injections (IAIs) of polymerized-collagen among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) in delaying or preventing joint replacement surgery. Patients and Methods. This was a cohort study of 309 patients with knee OA. Patients with mild-to-moderate disease were treated weekly with IAIs of 2 mL of polymerized-collagen for six weeks (n = 309). Follow-up was for 6–60 months. The primary endpoints included the following determinations: (1) therapeutic effect; (2) survival from total knee replacement surgery (TKR); (3) Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and pain (visual analogue scale, VAS). Clinical improvement was defined as a decrease in pain exceeding 20 mm on the VAS and the achievement of at least 20% improvement from baseline with respect to the WOMAC score. Radiographic analysis was performed at baseline and 60 months. The joint space width in the medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments was calculated. Results. Patients who received IAIs of polymerized-collagen had a statistically significant improvement in the primary criteria (p&lt;0.05). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of the therapeutic effect demonstrated 98.8% survival at 60 months with TKR as the endpoint. There was no significant reduction in joint space in any compartment based on the analyzed radiographs. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusion. Polymerized-collagen increased the time to TKR by at least 60 months, modifying the disease course, improving functional disability, and decreasing pain.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor (AnCMBR) is an attractive alternative for the treatment of high-strength phenol wastewater, but the effects of sludge retention time (SRT) on the performance and membrane fouling are still unclear. The results indicated that the AnCMBR was successfully employed to treat high-strength wastewater containing 5 g phenol L-1. The removal efficiencies of phenol and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached over 99.5% and 99%, respectively, with long SRT and short SRT. SRT had no obvious effect on the performance of the AnCMBR treating high-strength phenol wastewater with long time operation. The strong performance robustness of AnCMBR benefited from the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and syntrophic phenol-degrading bacteria. However, the decline of SRT led to a more severe membrane fouling in the AnCMBR, which was caused by the small size of sludge flocs and high concentration of protein in the biopolymers. Therefore, this work presented a comprehensive insight to the feasibility and robustness of the AnCMBR for treating high-strength phenol wastewater.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nowadays, visual encoding models use convolution neural networks (CNNs) with outstanding performance in computer vision to simulate the process of human information processing. However, the prediction performances of encoding models will have differences based on different networks driven by different tasks. Here, the impact of network tasks on encoding models is studied. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the features of natural visual stimulation are extracted using a segmentation network (FCN32s) and a classification network (VGG16) with different visual tasks but similar network structure. Then, using three sets of features, i.e., segmentation, classification, and fused features, the regularized orthogonal matching pursuit (ROMP) method is used to establish the linear mapping from features to voxel responses. The analysis results indicate that encoding models based on networks performing different tasks can effectively but differently predict stimulus-induced responses measured by fMRI. The prediction accuracy of the encoding model based on VGG is found to be significantly better than that of the model based on FCN in most voxels but similar to that of fused features. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the CNN performing the classification task is more similar to human visual processing than that performing the segmentation task.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The hair cells that reside in the cochlear sensory epithelium are the fundamental sensory structures responsible for understanding the mechanical sound waves evoked in the environment. The intense damage to these sensory structures may result in permanent hearing loss. The present strategies to rehabilitate the hearing function include either hearing aids or cochlear implants that may recover the hearing capability of deaf patients to a limited extent. Therefore, much attention has been paid on developing regenerative therapies to regenerate/replace the lost hair cells to treat the damaged cochlear sensory epithelium. The stem cell therapy is a promising approach to develop the functional hair cells and neuronal cells from endogenous and exogenous stem cell pool to recover hearing loss. In this review, we specifically discuss the potential of different kinds of stem cells that hold the potential to restore sensorineural hearing loss in mammals and comprehensively explain the current therapeutic applications of stem cells in both the human and mouse inner ear to regenerate/replace the lost hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. Patients with the same pathogenic mutations may exhibit various hearing loss phenotypes. In the Chinese population, the c.235delC mutation is the most common pathogenic mutation of GJB2 and is closely related to hereditary recessive hearing loss. Here, we investigated the hearing phenotypes of patients with hearing loss associated with the homozygous c.235delC mutation, paying special attention to asymmetric interaural hearing loss. A total of 244 patients with the GJB2 c.235delC homozygous mutation encountered from 2007 to 2015 were enrolled. The severity of hearing loss was scaled with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). Auditory phenotypes were analyzed, and three types of interaural asymmetry were defined based on audiograms: Type A (asymmetry of hearing loss severity), Type B (asymmetry of audiogram shape), and Type C (Type A plus Type B). Of the 488 ears (244 cases) examined, 71.93% (351) presented with profound hearing loss, 14.34% (70) with severe hearing loss, and 9.43% (46) with moderate to severe hearing loss. The most common audiogram shapes were descending (31.15%) and flat (24.18%). A total of 156 (63.93%) of the 244 patients exhibited asymmetric interaural hearing loss in terms of severity and/or audiogram shape. Type A was evident in 14 of these cases, Type B in 106, and Type C in 36. In addition, 211 of 312 ears (67.63%) in the interaural hearing asymmetry group showed profound hearing loss, and 59 (18.91%) exhibited severe hearing loss, with the most common audiogram shapes being flat (27.88%) and descending (22.12%). By contrast, in the interaural hearing symmetry group, profound hearing loss was observed in 140 ears (79.55%), and the most common audiograms were descending (46.59%) and residual (21.59%). Hearing loss associated with the GJB2 c.235delC homozygous mutation shows diverse phenotypes, and a considerable proportion of patients show bilateral hearing loss asymmetry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Genetic hearing loss is a common sensory disorder, and its cause is highly heterogeneous. In this study, by targeted next-generation sequencing of 414 known deafness genes, we identified compound heterozygous mutations p.R34X/p.M413T in TMC1 and p.S3417del/p.R1407T in MYO15A in two recessive Chinese Han deaf families. Intrafamilial cosegregation of the mutations with the hearing phenotype was confirmed in both families by the Sanger sequencing. Auditory features of the affected individuals are consistent with that previously reported for recessive mutations in TMC1 and MYO15A. The two novel mutations identified in this study, p.M413T in TMC1 and p.R1407T in MYO15A, are classified as likely pathogenic according to the guidelines of ACMG. Our study expanded the mutation spectrums of TMC1 and MYO15A and illustrated that genotype-phenotype correlation in combination with next-generation sequencing may improve the accuracy for genetic diagnosis of deafness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The precise mechanisms of nerve regeneration remain unclear. The potential of facial nerve regeneration and probable mechanisms involved following chronic facial nerve injury should be further studied. Methods. Adult male Wistar rats were used to model either (i) facial nerve injury (axotomy) or (ii) reinjury (chronic axotomy followed by a second axotomy within 5 months). The rats were housed in the animal facility of the Eye and ENT Hospital of Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). Expression of Shh (sonic hedgehog) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43, a neuronal marker) was detected in bilateral facial nuclei using reverse transcriptase PCR, western blotting analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The number of surviving motoneurons was quantified, and facial nerve regeneration was examined using transmission electron microscopy. Results. Reinjury of the facial nerve 12 weeks after the first axotomy resulted in upregulation of GAP43 mRNA and protein expression in neurons ipsilateral to the axotomy; immunohistochemistry revealed that Shh expression was higher compared with control side facial nuclei at the same time point. GAP43 expression subsequently decreased. Conclusion. The greatest regeneration potential of the facial nerve occurred within 5 months following chronic axotomy in rats, and regeneration may involve the Shh signaling pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Waardenburg syndrome is an uncommon genetic condition characterized by at least some degree of congenital hearing loss and pigmentation deficiencies. However, the genetic pathway affecting the development of stria vascularis is not fully illustrated. Methods. The transcript profile of stria vascularis of Waardenburg syndrome was studied using Mitf-M mutant pig and mice models. Therefore, GO analysis was performed to identify the differential gene expression caused by Mitf-M mutation. Results. There were 113 genes in tyrosine metabolism, melanin formation, and ion transportations showed significant changes in pig models and 191 genes in mice models. In addition, there were some spice’s specific gene changes in the stria vascularis in the mouse and porcine models. The expression of tight junction-associated genes, including Cadm1, Cldn11, Pcdh1, Pcdh19, and Cdh24 genes, were significantly higher in porcine models compared to mouse models. Vascular-related and ion channel-related genes in the stria vascularis were also shown significantly difference between the two species. The expression of Col2a1, Col3a1, Col11a1, and Col11a2 genes were higher, and the expression of Col8a2, Cd34, and Ncam genes were lower in the porcine models compared to mouse models. Conclusions. Our data suggests that there is a significant difference on the gene expression and function between these two models.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known as highly plastic stem cells and can differentiate into specialized tissues such as adipose tissue, osseous tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is very important in regenerative medicine. Their differentiation process is regulated by signaling pathways of epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels. Circular RNA (circRNA), a class of noncoding RNAs generated from protein-coding genes, plays a pivotal regulatory role in many biological processes. Accumulated studies have demonstrated that several circRNAs participate in the cell differentiation process of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. In the current review, characteristics and functions of circRNAs in stem cell differentiation will be discussed. The mechanism and key role of circRNAs in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, especially adipogenesis, will be reviewed and discussed. Understanding the roles of these circRNAs will present us with a more comprehensive signal path network of modulating stem cell differentiation and help us discover potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in clinic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool (G.A.I.T.) is well-accepted for determining changes in gait quality in neurological patients. This study is aimed at translating the G.A.I.T. to Thai and to examine its validity and reliability. Methods. The Thai translation and back-translation into English were done according to international guidelines. Sixty-eight patients with subacute to chronic stroke were recruited. Concurrent validity was determined by the correlation coefficient between the Thai G.A.I.T. scale and a comfortable vs. fast gait speed. The convergent validity was determined by the correlation coefficient between the Thai G.A.I.T. and the lower extremity Motricity Index, the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Interrater reliability was assessed using videos of 68 patients analysed by two independent raters. Each rater was randomly assigned to rescore the Thai G.A.I.T. for each patient over at least two weeks to assess intrarater reliability. Results. The concurrent validity of the Thai G.A.I.T. vs. the respective comfortable and fast gait speeds was excellent (Rs=−0.79 and Rs=−0.68, p&lt;0.001). The respective convergent validity with the lower extremity Motricity Index, NIHSS, and FAC was Rs=−0.62, 0.57, and -0.51, respectively. The respective inter- and intrarater reliabilities were excellent (ICC=0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.96 and 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.97). Conclusion. A Thai version of the G.A.I.T. was developed, and its validity and reliability for use among patients with subacute to chronic stroke were established. Further work regarding the responsiveness of the tool is needed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The transit network design problem involves determining a certain number of routes to operate in an urban area to balance the costs of the passengers and the operator. In this paper, we simultaneously determine the route structure of each route and the number of routes in the final solution. A novel initial route set generation algorithm and a route set size alternating heuristic are embedded into a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II- (NSGA-II-) based solution framework to produce the approximate Pareto front. The initial route set generation algorithm aims to generate high-quality initial solutions for succeeding optimization procedures. To explore the solution space and to have solutions with a different number of routes, a route set size alternating heuristic is developed to change the number of routes in a solution by adding or deleting one route. Experiments were performed on Mandl’s network and four larger Mumford’s networks. Compared with a fixed route set size approach, the proposed NSGA-II-based solution method can produce an approximate Pareto front with much higher solution quality as well as improved computation efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Innovation is a game process; in particular, the behavior among multiple agents in responsible innovation is susceptible to the influence of benefits, risks, responsibilities, and other factors, resulting in unstable collaborative relationships. Therefore, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model including the government, enterprises, and the public, combined with system dynamics modeling to simulate and analyze the tripartite behavior strategy and sensitivity to relevant exogenous variables. The study shows that the tripartite game eventually converges to a stable state of the government active supervision, enterprises making responsible innovation, and the public’s positive participation. The positive participation of the public drives rapidly the game to a steady state, while the behavioral strategies of enterprises are more susceptible to the behavior of the government. Supervision cost, penalty amount, and value compensation are the most critical factors influencing the change of the corresponding agents’ behavior strategy, and the final strategic stability of tripartite is affected by multiple exogenous variables.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Midcrustal rocks in retrograde metamorphic settings are typically H2O-undersaturated and fluid-absent and have low permeability. Exhumed continental retrograde faults, nonetheless, show evidence for the operation of fluid-mediated weakening mechanisms during deformation at midcrustal conditions. To explore the origin and effects of fluids in retrograde faults, we study the Kuckaus Mylonite Zone (KMZ), an exhumed crustal-scale, strike-slip shear zone in the southern Namibian Namaqua Metamorphic Complex. The KMZ deformed quartzofeldspathic migmatised gneisses at midcrustal retrograde conditions (450-480°C, 270-420 MPa) in the Mesoproterozoic, 40 Ma after granulite facies peak metamorphism at 825°C and 550 MPa. The mylonites contain fully hydrated retrograde mineral assemblages, predominantly adjacent to anastomosing high-strain zones, providing evidence of local H2O saturation and fluid presence during deformation. Whole rock and quartz vein δ18O values suggest that at least some of the fluids were meteoric in origin. The rocks across the shear zone retain the effect of different protoliths, implying little effect of fluid-rock interaction on whole rock major element chemistry. Together with a general scarcity of quartz veins, this suggests that fluid/rock ratios remained low in the KMZ. However, even small amounts of H2O allowed reaction weakening and diffusion-precipitation, followed by growth and alignment of phyllosilicates. In the ultramylonites, a fine grain size in the presence of fluids allowed for grain size sensitive creep. We conclude that the influx of even small volumes of fluids into retrograde shear zones can induce drastic weakening by facilitating grain size sensitive creep and retrograde reactions. In retrograde settings, these reactions consume fluids, and therefore elevated fluid pressures will only be possible after considerable weakening has already occurred. Our findings imply that the range of seismic styles recently documented at active retrograde transform faults may not require high fluid pressures but could also arise from other local weakening mechanisms.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Miriam P. Leary</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Experiential learning pedagogies, including internship and service-learning experiences, are becoming increasingly popular in higher education. An internship engages students with hands-on experiences that enhance their learning or skills within their fields of study. In contrast, service-learning is a type of experiential education in which students participate in service, typically within the community, and reflect on their involvement to gain further understanding of the discipline as well as its relationship to societal needs. To date, no study has directly compared these teaching modalities. Therefore, the present study systematically evaluated a service-learning experience against an internship experience using a mixed-methods model with the primary outcome being student self-efficacy. Sixteen exercise physiology students (13 females) completed a community-based wellness internship with a subgroup (nine students, 7 females) allocated to a service-learning component of internship designed to improve self-efficacy. At the end of the semester, students completed a 15-item online self-efficacy and satisfaction survey. Three focus groups were conducted in which 3-4 participants responded to a series of nine questions that explored their experience. Overall responses to the self-efficacy and satisfaction survey were favorable for both groups, but the internship group was more likely to agree or strongly agree with statements of self-efficacy. Focus groups found that the internship experience reinforced classroom learning, but the ability to work with different populations and ability levels was mentioned only by the service-learning group. Themes from reflective assignments, such as engaging with community members and professional exploration, were evident only in the service-learning group responses. Therefore, the findings indicate that service-learning reflection assignments successfully connect the service experience to relevant course outcomes promoting student development but may not improve self-reported self-efficacy beyond that of a typical internship experience.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Atmospheric pollution is one of the biggest concerns for public health. Air quality monitoring is currently performed by expensive and cumbersome monitoring stations. For this reason, they are sparse, and therefore, inadequate to provide enough accurate information on the personal exposure to pollutant gases. The current worldwide trend to address this issue consists in the use of low-cost small gas sensors, already available on the market, with a wide range of costs and performances. However, the performance of these sensors is heavily affected by the environmental conditions of the specific location used for their deployment. For this reason, it is of fundamental importance to test them in real-world scenarios. Field evaluation of sensor performance could be a challenging task because, on the one hand, they have heterogeneous output signals, and on the other hand, there is no widely shared evaluation protocol. The SentinAir system has been designed and developed to facilitate this task. It can carry out performance evaluations for any type of sensor thanks to its configurable and adaptable sensing capability, multiple wireless sensor network compatibility, flexibility, and usability. In order to evaluate SentinAir capabilities and functionalities, the performances of CO2, NO2, and O3 sensors were tested in real-world scenarios against reference instruments. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study providing information about the performance of SP-61 (O3 sensor), IRC-A1 (CO2 sensor), and TDS5008 (CO2 sensor) achieved during on-field tests. On the contrary, results obtained by OXB431 (O3 sensor) and NO2B43F (NO2 sensor) are consistent with the ones shown in previous studies carried out in similar conditions. During validation tests, we have found R2=0.507 for the best performing NO2 sensor, and R2=0.668 for the best O3 sensor. Concerning the indoor experiment, the best CO2 sensor performance showed an excellent R2=0.995. In conclusion, the effectiveness of this tool in evaluating the performance of heterogeneous gas sensors in different real-world scenarios has been demonstrated. Therefore, we anticipate that the use of SentinAir will facilitate researchers to carry out these challenging tasks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. This study was aimed at identifying the potential outcome predictors, comparing the efficacy in patients with different tremor characteristics, and summarizing the adverse effect rates (AERs) of deep brain stimulation on the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM-DBS) for essential tremor (ET). Methods. An extensive search of articles published to date in 2019 was conducted, and two main aspects were analyzed. Improvement was calculated as a percentage of change in any objective tremor rating scale (TRS) and analyzed by subgroup analyses of patients’ tremor characteristics, laterality, and stimulation parameters. Furthermore, the AERs were analyzed as follows: the adverse effects (AEs) were classified as stimulation-related, surgical-related, or device-related effects. A simple regression analysis was used to identify the potential prognostic factors, and a two-sample mean-comparison test was used to verify the statistical significance of the subgroup analyses. Results. Forty-six articles involving 1714 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled improvement in any objective TRS score was 61.3% (95% CI: 0.564-0.660) at the mean follow-up visit (20.0±17.3 months). The midline and extremity symptoms showed consistent improvement (P=0.440), and the results of the comparison of postural and kinetic tremor were the same (P=0.219). In addition, the improvement in rest tremor was similar to that in action tremor (OR=2.759, P=0.120). In the simple regression analysis, the preoperative Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS) scores and follow-up time were negatively correlated with the percentage change in any objective TRS score (P&lt;0.05). The most common adverse event was dysarthria (10.5%), which is a stimulation-related AE (23.6%), while the rates of the surgical-related and device-related AEs were 6.4% and 11.5%, respectively. Conclusion. VIM-DBS is an efficient and safe surgical method in ET, and the efficacy was not affected by the body distribution of tremor, age at surgery, and disease duration. Lower preoperative FTM-TRS scores likely indicate greater improvement, and the effect of VIM-DBS declines over time.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Among major volatiles released from the Earth’s interior, CO2 is an important target for the international community. The interest is keenly motivated by the contribution of CO2 in the Earth’s carbon budget and its role on past, current, and future climate dynamics. In particular, the isotopic signature of CO2 is fundamental to characterize the source of this gas and its evolution up to the atmosphere. The recent development of new laser-based techniques has marked an important milestone for the scientific community by favoring both high-frequency and in situ stable isotope measurements. Among them, the Delta Ray IRIS (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) is one of the most promising instruments thanks to its high precision, its limited interferences with other gaseous species (such as H2S and/or SO2), and its internal calibration procedure. These characteristics and the relative easiness to transport the Delta Ray IRIS have encouraged its use on the field to analyze volcanic CO2 emissions in recent years but often with distinct customized protocols of measurements. In this study, various tests in the laboratory and on the field have been performed to study the dependence of CO2 isotope measurements on analytical, instrumental, and environmental conditions. We emphasize the exceptional ability of the Delta Ray IRIS to perform isotope measurements for a large range of CO2 concentration (200 ppm–100%) thanks to a dilution system and to get a reliable estimation of the real CO2 content from the diluted one. These tests lead to point out major recommendations on the use of Delta Ray IRIS and allow the development of adapted protocols to analyze CO2 emissions like in volcanic environments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper establishes design criteria for soft exogloves (SEG) to be used as rehabilitation or assistance devices. This research consists in identifying, selecting, and grouping SEG features based on the analysis of 91 systems that have been proposed during the last decade. Thus, function, mobility, and usability criteria are defined and explicitly discussed to highlight SEG design guidelines. Additionally, this study provides a detailed description of each system that was analysed including application, functional task, palm design, actuation type, assistance mode, degrees of freedom (DOF), target fingers, motions, material, weight, force, pressure (only for fluids), control strategy, and assessment. Such characteristics have been reported according to specific design methodologies and operating principles. Technological trends are contemplated in this contribution with emphasis on SEG design opportunity areas. In this review, suggestions, limitations, and implications are also discussed in order to enhance future SEG developments aimed at stroke survivors or people with hand disabilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The study investigated the effect of weekly supragingival irrigation with aerosolized 0.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution as a maintenance periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with chronic periodontitis. The other purpose was to investigate whether cavitation bubbles can penetrate not only into periodontitis-damaged tissues but also into ex vivo porcine healthy periodontal tissues. Materials and Methods. The study included 35 systemically healthy patients with chronic periodontitis (CP). After nonsurgical periodontal debridement (NSPD), all patients were randomized into two groups: the Control group (NSDP alone, n=18) and the Test group (NSDP plus supragingival irrigation, n=17). Clinical (Approximal Plaque Index (API), Bleeding Index (BI), and Modified Gingival Index (MGI)) and microbiological (Polymerase Chain Reaction technology (using a micro-IDent® kit)) measurements were performed at the initial time point, 3 months, and 6 months after NSPD. The impact of supragingival irrigation on diseased gingival tissues of CP patients (n=5) and on ex vivo porcine healthy gingival tissue samples (n=3) was evaluated to estimate morphological changes in healthy and diseased gingival tissues. Results. Morphological data revealed that supragingival irrigation caused the formation of cavitation bubbles in diseased gingival tissue of CP patients and in healthy porcine gingival tissues. The decrease in API, BI, and MGI scores after 6 months in the Test group significantly (p≤0.01, p≤0.05, and p≤0.01, respectively) exceeded that in the Control group. Test group patients demonstrated a decrease in periodontal sites showing Pocket Probing Depth&gt;4 mm and, after 6 months, a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of periopathogenic bacteria. Conclusion. The effectiveness of mechanical periodontal treatment combined with weekly supragingival irrigation with aerosolized 0.5% H2O2 solution on clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal tissues of periodontitis patients is reliably higher than that of mechanical periodontal debridement alone. It has been found that cavitation bubbles as a result of irrigation with the aerosolized 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solution can form not only in periodontal tissues of periodontitis patients but also in ex vivo porcine healthy gingival tissues.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Regular utilization of maternal health care services decreases maternal morbidity and mortality. However, major predictors that influence the utilization of the existing maternal health care services are complex and differ from place to place. Therefore, assessing these predictors assists health planners to prioritize promotion strategies and is a fundamental step for intervention. This study assessed the utilization and predictors of maternal health care services among women of the reproductive age in Hawassa Health and Demographic Surveillance System site, South Ethiopia, 2019. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 682 women of the reproductive age from January to February, in 2019. A two-stage stratified sampling method was utilized. Data were collected using a structured, face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire. The data were entered using Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. The variables were entered into the multivariable model using the backward stepwise regression approach. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with utilization of the maternal health care. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed to assess the presence and strength of associations. Result. The overall utilization of ANC, institutional delivery, and PNC was 69.1, 52.1, and 32.7%, respectively. The odds of utilizing ANC were 4.72 times higher for women who have a formal education (AOR: 4.72, 95% CI = 2.82–7.90) as compared to those who have no formal education. The odds of utilizing institutional delivery were 5.96 times higher for women who had ANC follow-up (AOR: 5.96; 95% CI = 3.88–9.18) as compared to those who had no ANC follow-up. Presence of information about the PNC (AOR: 3.66; 95% CI = 2.18–6.14) and autonomy of a woman to make decision on health issues (AOR: 6.13, 95% CI = 3.86–9.73) were positively associated with utilization of PNC. Conclusion. The utilization of maternal health care services is far below the national target in the study area. Maternal and paternal education status, autonomy of the woman to make decision on the health issues, wealth status, and having a plan on the current pregnancy were major predictors of the maternal health care service utilization. Providing information and training about the model household to the women about maternal health care service utilization using various methods of health education should be considered.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Kai Fan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cunlong Zhou</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the help of the auxiliary function method, we solved the improved Boussinesq (IBq) equation with fluid dynamic damping and the modified IBq (IMBq) equation with Stokes damping, and we obtained their three types of travelling wave exact solutions, which is an extension service of the numerical simulation and the existence of a solution. From the waveform diagram of IBq equation with hydrodynamic damping, it can be seen that when the propagation velocity of kink wave changes, the amplitude also changes significantly, and it is also found that the kink isolated waveform is significantly asymmetric due to the increase of damping coefficient v, which may be of some value in explaining some physical phenomena. In addition, the symbolic computing software maple makes our computing work easier.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Underwater image processing is a difficult subtopic in the field of computer vision due to the complex underwater environment. Since the light is absorbed and scattered, underwater images have many distortions such as underexposure, blurriness, and color cast. The poor quality hinders subsequent processing such as image classification, object detection, or segmentation. In this paper, we propose a method to collect underwater image pairs by placing two tanks in front of the camera. Due to the high-quality training data, the proposed restoration algorithm based on deep learning achieves inspiring results for underwater images taken in a low-light environment. The proposed method solves two of the most challenging problems for underwater image: darkness and fuzziness. The experimental results show that the proposed method surpasses most other methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The need and importance of Smart Spaces have been potentially realized by the researchers due to its applicability in the current lifestyle. Opportunistic network, a successor of mobile ad hoc networks and a budding technology of network, is a best-suited technology for implementing Smart Spaces due to its wide range of applications in real-life scenarios ranging from building smart cities to interplanetary communication. There are numerous routing protocols which are available in opportunistic network, each having their pros and cons; however, no research till the time of listing has been done which can quantitatively demonstrate the maximum performance of these protocols and standardize the comparison of opportunistic routing protocols which has been a major cause of ambiguous performance evaluation studies. The work here presents a categorical view of the opportunistic routing protocol family and thereby compares and contrasts the various simulators suited for their simulation. Thereafter, the most popular protocols (selecting at least one protocol from each category) are compared based on node density on as many as 8 standard performance metrics using ONE simulator to observe their scalability, realism, and comparability. The work concludes by presenting the merits and demerits of each of the protocols discussed as well as specifying the best routing protocol among all the available protocols for Smart Spaces with maximum output. It is believed that the results achieved by the implemented methodology will help future researchers to choose appropriate routing protocol to delve into their research under different scenarios.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yuhuan Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yongsheng Ren</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jinfeng Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Using the cutter bar made with composite rather than metal in high rotating speed milling or boring operations is a new attempt for suppressing chatter of the cutting system. This is because composite material has much higher specific stiffness and damping as well as dynamic stiffness compared to metal. But, for a rotating composite cutter bar, larger internal damping (or rotational damping) occurs, and such damping may cause the rotor instability in the perspective of rotor dynamics. On the other hand, the effect of internal damping of a rotating composite cutter bar on the chatter stability in high speed cutting process is also an important issue worthy of concern. In this paper, a new dynamic model of the cutting system with a rotating composite cutter bar is presented. The cutter bar is modelled as a rotating, cantilever, tapered, composite Euler–Bernoulli shaft, subjected to a regenerative cutting force. Modal damping loss factors are described based on the viscoelastic constitutive relation of composite combined with an energy approach. The governing equations of the system are obtained by employing Hamilton principle. Galerkin method is used to discretize the partial differential equations of motion. The frequency-domain solution of stability proposed by Altintas and Budak [14] is extended and used to predict the chatter stability of the cutting system. The results reveal the inherent relationship between internal damping instability and cutting chatter. The effects of the geometry parameters of the cutter bar, ply angle, stacking sequences, and internal and external damping are examined.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>BinBin Shen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper proposes an idea of using time-delay partitioning to construct a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) to analyse event-driven network control systems (NCSs) with the H∞ performance. Firstly, select a mixed event-driven mechanism, in which an adjustable absolute trigger mechanism is added to the trigger condition. Trigger term can be indicated to use a delay model. Secondly, a suitable LKF is created, which makes use of time-delay partitioning. Based on Wirtinger inequality and linear matrix inequalities (LMI), the close system with H∞ performance index level is global uniform ultimate bounded. Finally, a numerical simulation example proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The development of controllers for underactuated systems with nonholonomic constraints has been a topic of significant interest for many researchers in recent years. These systems are hard to control because their linearization transform them into uncontrollable systems. The proposed approaches involve the use of a permanent excitation in the reference trajectory; coordinate transformation; discontinuities; or complex calculations. This paper proposes the design of the controller of the second-order chained form system for trajectory tracking by using a simpler approach based on linear algebra. Up to the present time, no controllers based on this approach have been designed for that system. The control problem is solved by setting two of the three systems variables as a reference, while the remaining variable is calculated imposing the condition that the equations system has an exact solution to ensure that tracking errors go to zero. The stability of the proposed controller is theoretically demonstrated, and simulations results show a suitable control system performance. Also, no coordinate transformation is necessary.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Changfeng Chen</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Qiang Li</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Aiming at the shortcomings of single network classification model, this paper applies CNN-LSTM (convolutional neural networks-long short-term memory) combined network in the field of music emotion classification and proposes a multifeature combined network classifier based on CNN-LSTM which combines 2D (two-dimensional) feature input through CNN-LSTM and 1D (single-dimensional) feature input through DNN (deep neural networks) to make up for the deficiencies of original single feature models. The model uses multiple convolution kernels in CNN for 2D feature extraction, BiLSTM (bidirectional LSTM) for serialization processing and is used, respectively, for audio and lyrics single-modal emotion classification output. In the audio feature extraction, music audio is finely divided and the human voice is separated to obtain pure background sound clips; the spectrogram and LLDs (Low Level Descriptors) are extracted therefrom. In the lyrics feature extraction, the chi-squared test vector and word embedding extracted by Word2vec are, respectively, used as the feature representation of the lyrics. Combining the two types of heterogeneous features selected by audio and lyrics through the classification model can improve the classification performance. In order to fuse the emotional information of the two modals of music audio and lyrics, this paper proposes a multimodal ensemble learning method based on stacking, which is different from existing feature-level and decision-level fusion methods, the method avoids information loss caused by direct dimensionality reduction, and the original features are converted into label results for fusion, effectively solving the problem of feature heterogeneity. Experiments on million song dataset show that the audio classification accuracy of the multifeature combined network classifier in this paper reaches 68%, and the lyrics classification accuracy reaches 74%. The average classification accuracy of the multimodal reaches 78%, which is significantly improved compared with the single-modal.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Mohamed Laimoud</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Rehan Qureshi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background. Cardiac surgery carries a well-known risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), which is associated with high morbidity and both in-hospital and late mortality. The rapid haemodynamics deterioration and presence of myocardial ischemia early after cardiac surgical operations is a complex life-threatening condition where rapid diagnosis and management is of fundamental importance. Objective. To analyse the factors associated with mortality of patients with postcardiotomy MI and to study the role of emergency coronary angiography in management and outcome. Methods. We retrospectively enrolled adult patients diagnosed to have postcardiotomy MI and underwent emergency coronary angiography at our tertiary care hospital between January 2016 and August 2019. Results. Sixty-one patients from consecutive 1869 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgeries were enrolled in our study. The studied patients had a mean age of 49 ± 16.2 years with a mean BMI of 29.5 ± 6.6 and 65.6% of them were males. As compared to the survivors group, the nonsurvivors of perioperative MI had significant preoperative CKD, postoperative AKI, longer CPB time, frequent histories of previous PCI, previous cardiotomies, pre and postoperative ECMO use, higher median troponin I levels, higher peak and 24 hours median lactate levels. Regression analysis revealed that reoperation for revascularization (OR: 23; 95% CI: 8.27–217.06; P=0.034) and hyperlactataemia (OR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.14–9.04; P=0.027) were independent factors associated with hospital mortality after perioperative MI. Hospital mortality occurred in 25.7% vs 86.7% (P&lt;0.001), AKI occurred in 37.1% vs 93.3% (P&lt;0.001), haemodialysis was used in 28.6% vs 80% (P=0.002), and mediastinal exploration for bleeding was performed in 31.4% vs 80% (P=0.006) in the PCI and reoperation groups, respectively, while there were no significant differences regarding gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral strokes, or intracerebral bleeding. The median peak troponin level was 795 (IQR 630–1200) vs 4190 (IQR 3700–6300) (P&lt;0.001) in the PCI and reoperation groups, respectively. Absence of significant angiographic findings occurred in 18% of patients. Conclusions. Perioperative MI is associated with significant morbidities and hospital mortality. Reoperation for revascularization and progressive hyperlactataemia are independent predictors of hospital mortality. Emergency coronary angiography is helpful in diagnosis and management of perioperative MI.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. Sepsis is a severe complication in patients following major hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram based on inflammation biomarkers and clinical characteristics. Methods. Patients who underwent major hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery between June 2015 and April 2017 were retrospectively collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent risk factors associated with postoperative sepsis. A training cohort of 522 patients in an earlier period was used to develop the prediction models, and a validation cohort of 136 patients thereafter was used to validate the nomograms. Results. Sepsis developed in 55 of 522 patients of the training cohort and 19 of 136 patients in the validation cohort, respectively. In the training cohort, one nomogram based on clinical characteristics was developed. The clinical independent risk factors for postoperative sepsis include perioperative blood transfusion, diabetes, operative time, direct bilirubin, and BMI. Another nomogram was based on both clinical characteristics and inflammation biomarkers. Multivariate regression analyses showed that previous clinical risk factors, PCT, and CRP were independent risk factors for postoperative sepsis. The last nomogram showed a good C-index of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.787-0.900) compared with the previous one of 0.777 (95% CI, 0.713-0.840). Patients with a total score more than 109 in the second model are at high risk. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the second nomogram were 27% and 97%, respectively. Conclusion. The nomogram achieved good performances for predicting postoperative sepsis in patients by combining clinical and inflammation risk factors. This model can provide the early risk estimation of sepsis for patients following major hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. We performed this study to investigate the risk factors for postoperative hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection (CLND). Study Design. This was a single-center prospective study based on 176 consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma. Setting. Patients were recruited between January 2016 and June 2018. Subjects and Methods. Patients who underwent bilateral (n = 155, bilateral group) and ipsilateral CLND (n = 21) after total thyroidectomy were included. The preoperative and postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels were detected. The risk factors for transient hypocalcemia were identified using logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results. Fifty-one (28.98%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia, and 2 patients (1.14%) developed permanent hypoparathyroidism. There was no difference in the gender ratio or the morbidity of hypocalcemia between the patients who underwent bilateral and ipsilateral CLND. On postoperative day 1, PTH decrease was a risk factor for transient hypocalcemia in the whole cohort (β = 0.043, OR = 1.044, 95% CI 1.023–1.065, p&lt;0.001), bilateral group (β = 0.042, OR = 1.043, 95% CI 1.022–1.064, p&lt;0.001), and female patients (β = 0.049, OR = 1.050, 95% CI 1.026–1.075, p&lt;0.001). Tumor diameter was a risk factor for transient hypocalcemia in female patients (β = 0.499, OR = 1.647, 95% CI 1.003–2.704, p=0.049). The ROC curve analysis illustrated that 65.58%, 71.00%, and 71.00% PTH level reduction had high accuracy in predicting transient hypocalcemia in the whole cohort, bilateral group, and female patients, respectively (AUC = 0.986, 0.987, and 0.987). Conclusion. Asymptomatic female patients with bilateral CLND and a 71.00% PTH level reduction were at a high risk of transient hypocalcemia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we aim to determine some results of the generalized Bessel–Maitland function in the field of fractional calculus. Here, some relations of the generalized Bessel–Maitland functions and the Mittag-Leffler functions are considered. We develop Saigo and Riemann–Liouville fractional integral operators by using the generalized Bessel–Maitland function, and results can be seen in the form of Fox–Wright functions. We establish a new operator Zν,η,ρ,γ,w,a+μ,ξ,m,σϕ and its inverse operator Dν,η,ρ,γ,w,a+μ,ξ,m,σϕ, involving the generalized Bessel–Maitland function as its kernel, and also discuss its convergence and boundedness. Moreover, the Riemann–Liouville operator and the integral transform (Laplace) of the new operator have been developed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we study the dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth infection. We formulate and analyse a deterministic compartmental model using nonlinear differential equations. The basic reproduction number is obtained and both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are shown to be asymptotically stable under given threshold conditions. The model may exhibit backward bifurcation for some parameter values, and the sensitivity indices of the basic reproduction number with respect to the parameters are determined. We extend the model to include control measures for eradication of the infection from the community. Pontryagian’s maximum principle is used to formulate the optimal control problem using three control strategies, namely, health education through provision of educational materials, educational messages to improve the awareness of the susceptible population, and treatment by mass drug administration that target the entire population(preschool- and school-aged children) and sanitation through provision of clean water and personal hygiene. Numerical simulations were done using MATLAB and graphical results are displayed. The cost effectiveness of the control measures were done using incremental cost-effective ratio, and results reveal that the combination of health education and sanitation is the best strategy to combat the helminth infection. Therefore, in order to completely eradicate soil-transmitted helminths, we advise investment efforts on health education and sanitation controls.</dc:description>

A Hybrid Choice Modelling Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stefano de Luca</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Roberta Di Pace</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is common opinion that traditional approaches used to interpret and model users’ choice behaviour in innovative contexts may lead to neglecting numerous nonquantitative factors that may affect users’ perceptions and behaviours. Indeed, psychological factors, such as attitudes, concerns, and perceptions may play a significant role which should be explicitly modelled. By contrast, collecting psychological factors could be a time and cost consuming activity, and furthermore, real-world applications must rely on theoretical paradigms which are able to easily predict choice/market fractions. The present paper aims to investigate the above-mentioned issues with respect to an innovative automotive technology based on the after-market hybridization of internal combustion engine vehicles. In particular, three main research questions are addressed: (i) whether and how users’ characteristics and attitudes may affect users’ behaviour with respect to new technological (automotive) scenarios (e.g., after-market hybridization kit); (ii) how to better “grasp” users’ attitudes/concerns/perceptions and, in particular, which is the most effective surveying approach to observe users’ attitudes; (iii) to what extent the probability of choosing a new automotive technology is sensitive to attitudes/concerns changes. The choice to install/not install the innovative technology was modelled through a hybrid choice model with latent variables (HCMs), starting from a stated preferences survey in which attitudes were investigated using different types of questioning approaches: direct questioning, indirect questioning, or both approaches. Finally, a comparison with a traditional binomial logit model and a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the instrumental attributes and the attitudes. Obtained results indicate that attitudes are significant in interpreting and predicting users’ behaviour towards the investigated technology and the HCM makes it possible to easily embed psychological factors into a random utility model/framework. Moreover, the explicit simulation of the attitudes allows for a better prediction of users’ choice with respect to the Logit formulation and points out that users’ behaviour may be significantly affected by acting on users’ attitudes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To investigate the relationship between pain behavior and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 2 (KCNA2) expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of rats with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group (group C), normal saline group (group S), and group OA. Paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) were measured one day before injection and one, two, four, and six weeks after injection. At one, two, four, and six weeks after injection, pathological knee joint changes and activated transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) and KCNA2 expressions in DRGs were analyzed. Results. Compared with preinjection, PWMT and PWTL at two, four, and six weeks after injection were significantly decreased in the group OA (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01). Compared with group C, PWMT and PWTL at two, four, and six weeks after injection were significantly decreased in the group OA (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01). In the group OA, slight local articular cartilage surface destruction was found at week one. The cartilage surface destruction gradually developed, and the exacerbation of cartilage matrix reduction and bone hyperplasia were increasingly aggravated and eventually evolved into advanced OA in the second to sixth weeks. Compared with group C, ATF-3 expression was significantly increased, and KCNA2 expression was significantly decreased in the group OA at two, four, and six weeks after injection (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01). Compared to baseline, ATF-3 expression was significantly increased, and KCNA2 expression was significantly decreased in the group OA (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01). Conclusion. Pain behavior in OA rats was associated with decreased KCNA2 expression in DRGs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the last years, big data analysis has become a popular means of taking advantage of multiple (initially valueless) sources to find relevant knowledge about real domains. However, a large number of big data sources provide textual unstructured data. A proper analysis requires tools able to adequately combine big data and text-analysing techniques. Keeping this in mind, we combined a pipelining framework (BDP4J (Big Data Pipelining For Java)) with the implementation of a set of text preprocessing techniques in order to create NLPA (Natural Language Preprocessing Architecture), an extendable open-source plugin implementing preprocessing steps that can be easily combined to create a pipeline. Additionally, NLPA incorporates the possibility of generating datasets using either a classical token-based representation of data or newer synset-based datasets that would be further processed using semantic information (i.e., using ontologies). This work presents a case study of NLPA operation covering the transformation of raw heterogeneous big data into different dataset representations (synsets and tokens) and using the Weka application programming interface (API) to launch two well-known classifiers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aplysin is a brominated sesquiterpene with an isoprene skeleton and has biological activities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of aplysin on spontaneous pancreatic necrosis in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and its potential mechanisms. Results showed that NOD mice at 12 weeks of age showed obvious spontaneous pancreatic necrosis, damaged tight junctions of intestinal epithelia, and widened gaps in tight and adherens junctions. Aplysin intervention was able to alleviate spontaneous pancreatic necrosis in NOD mice, accompanied with decreased serum endotoxin levels and downregulated expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 and its related molecules MyD88, TRAF-6, NF-κB p65, TRIF, TRAM, and IRF-3, as well as protein levels of interleukin-1β and interferon-β in pancreatic tissues. In addition, we observed obvious improvements of intestinal mucosal barrier function and changes of gut microbiota in the relative abundance at the phylum level and the genus level in aplysin-treated mice compared with control mice. Together, these data suggested that aplysin could retard spontaneous pancreatic necrosis and inflammatory responses in NOD mice through the stabilization of intestinal barriers and regulation of gut microbial composition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, have been recognized to contribute to neuroinflammation. Previous studies have shown that activated mast cells may be involved in surgery-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis by using pharmacological methods. This study is aimed at ascertaining the exactly role of mast cells on neuroinflammation with the mast cell-deficient mice. Adult male C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) and mast cell-deficient (C57BL6/J KitWsh/Wsh (Wsh)) mice underwent tibial fracture surgery. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, microglial activation, and neuroinflammatory levels were examined at 1 day after surgery. Surgery-induced BBB breakdown, microglial activation, and neuroinflammatory levels were significantly, pharmacologically reduced using a mast cell stabilizer, cromolyn sodium in WT mice (P&lt;0.05). These results were reproduced with mast cell deficiency. WT mice administered intraventricularly with cromolyn exhibited reduced BBB breakdown, microglial activation, and neuroinflammatory levels versus vehicle (P&lt;0.05). But there was no effect of cromolyn versus vehicle in Wsh mice, clarifying the specificity of cromolyn on brain mast cells. These findings demonstrated that activated mast cells promote surgery-induced BBB breakdown and neuroinflammation in mice, and open up a new therapeutic target for neuroinflammation-related diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nanosecond pulsed electric field (NsPEF) ablation effectively eliminates early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by local ablation and advanced HCC by inducing a remarkable and sustained host immune response. However, this approach is not sufficient to prevent cancer progression, and complementary approaches are necessary for effective immunotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the immunoactivating effects and mechanisms of action of nsPEF ablation and PD-1 blockade on an HCC orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Briefly, 24 C57BL-6J tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to three groups: nsPEF ablation group, anti-PD-1 administration group, and untreated control group. Tumor-infiltrating T, B, and NK cell levels and plasma concentrations of Th1 (IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10), Th9 (IL-9), and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22) cytokines were evaluated. Both nsPEF ablation and anti-PD-1 treatment induced immune cell infiltration in local tumors and modulated cytokine levels in the peripheral blood, with distinct changes in the two treatment groups. Based on these findings, both nsPEF ablation and PD-1 antibody administration can trigger a local and systemic immune response in a partially complementary manner, and nsPEF ablation should be considered along with PD-1 blockade for the treatment of HCC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Global control and elimination of tuberculosis are hindered by the high prevalence of drug-resistant strains, making the development of new drugs to fight tuberculosis a public health priority. In this study, we evaluated 118 extracts from 58 Venezuelan plant species for their ability to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mc26020, using the agar dilution method. Additionally, we determined the ability of these extracts to inhibit the activity of PknB protein, an essential M. tuberculosis serine/threonine kinase, using a high-throughput luminescent assay. Of the 118 extracts tested, 14 inhibited bacterial growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration ≤500 μg/ml, and 36 inhibited the kinase activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration &lt;200 μg/ml. Five extracts inhibited M. tuberculosis growth and inhibited the activity of the kinase protein, suggesting that this could be the basis of their growth inhibition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common malignancy of the stomach. This study was aimed at elucidating the regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA and identifying the precise inflammation-related targets in GC. The expression profiles of GSE83521, GSE78091, and GSE33651 were obtained from the GEO database. Interactions between miRNAs and circRNAs were investigated by the Circular RNA Interactome, and targets of miRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase. Then, a circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network was constructed. Also, functional enrichment analysis of selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed. The inflammation-/GC-related targets were collected in the GeneCards and GenLiP3 database, respectively. And a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DE mRNAs was constructed with STRING and Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The genetic alterations, neighboring gene networks, expression levels, and the poor prognosis of hub genes were investigated in cBioPortal, Oncomine, and Human Protein Atlas databases and Kaplan-Meier plotter, respectively. A total of 10 DE miRNAs and 33 DEGs were identified. The regulatory network contained 26 circRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 1459 mRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the selected 33 DEGs were involved in negative regulation of fat cell differentiation, response to wounding, extracellular matrix- (ECM-) receptor interaction, and regulation of cell growth pathways. THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were selected as inflammation-related hub genes of GC in the PPI network. The genetic alterations in these hub genes were related to amplification and missense mutations. Furthermore, the genes RYR2, ERBB2, PI3KCA, and HELZ2 were connected to hub genes in this study. The hub gene levels in clinical specimens were markedly upregulated in GC tissues and correlated with poor overall survival (OS). Our results suggest that THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were associated with the pathogenesis of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as biomarkers and inflammation-related targets for GC.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yu Zheng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mathematical models are important methods in estimating epidemiological patterns of diseases and predicting the consequences of the spread of diseases. Investigation of risk factors of transportation modes and control of transportation exposures will help prevent disease transmission in the transportation system and protect people’s health. In this paper, a multimodal traffic distribution model is established to estimate the spreading of virus. The analysis is based on the empirical evidence learned from the real transportation network which connects Wuhan with other cities. We consider five mainstream travel modes, namely, auto mode, high-speed railway mode, common railway mode, coach mode, and flight mode. Logit model of economics is used to predict the distribution of trips and the corresponding diseases. The effectiveness of the model is verified with big data of the distribution of COVID-19 virus. We also conduct model-based tests to analyze the role of lockdown on different travel modes. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is implemented, the results of which assist in policy-making for containing infection transmission through traffic.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Wing Yiu Sarah Poon</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Joanna Yuet Ling Tung</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background. Minipuberty of infancy refers to the transient activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis during the first few months of life. Studies have documented a more exaggerated and prolonged gonadotropin surge in preterm infants compared with term infants. We present a case of minipuberty presenting with vaginal bleeding at the corrected age of 3 months of life. Case Presentation. A former 23 + 6-week infant presented with intermittent vaginal bleeding in the diaper at the corrected age of 3 months. Physical exam showed bilateral breast buds of 0.5 cm–1 cm with no signs of pubarche. Investigations showed pubertal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol. As she was impressed to have exaggerated minipuberty due to extreme prematurity, no intervention was given. Repeated hormonal workup at the corrected age of 8 months showed decreasing trend of gonadotropin and estradiol levels. Vaginal bleeding resolved, and breast buds also regressed clinically. Conclusion. Our case illustrated that the robust surge of gonadotropin in an ex-premature infant can in fact result in endometrial maturation and present as vaginal bleeding. Though the mechanism of this alteration in the HPG axis in prematurity is not clearly understood, pediatricians should be aware of the benign and self-limiting nature of this phenomenon and avoid unnecessary intervention.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. There is a pressing need for specific prognostic markers that could be used to monitor the severity of sepsis. The aims of our study were to investigate changes in the expression of different molecular forms of fibronectin in sepsis and to assess their relationship to the clinical severity and mortality of patients. Material and Methods. Forms of fibronectin: plasma (pFN), cellular (EDA-FN), FN-fibrin complexes, and fibronectin fragments were analyzed in 71 sepsis patients (survivors and nonsurvivors) and in the control by ELISA and immunoblotting. Results. The baseline pFN concentration of patients with sepsis was significantly lower than in the control (133.0 mg/L vs. 231.2 mg/L) (P&lt;0.001), and in nonsurvivors, it was lower than in survivors (106.0 mg/L vs. 152.8 mg/L) (P=0.004). The baseline EDA-FN was significantly elevated in both sepsis groups (survivors: 6.7 mg/L; nonsurvivors: 9.4 mg/L) compared to the control (1.4 mg/L) (P&lt;0.001). It should be noted that among patients with more severe sepsis, the EDA-FN level was higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Furthermore, molecular FN-fibrin complexes as well as FN fragments occurred much more frequently in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Conclusion. The study showed that in sepsis, changes in plasmatic and cellular form of fibronectin were associated with the severity of sepsis and may be useful predictors of outcome.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The benefit of prehospital epinephrine in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) was shown in a recent large placebo-controlled trial. However, placebo-controlled studies cannot identify the nonpharmacologic influences on concurrent or downstream events that might modify the main effect positively or negatively. We sought to identify the real-world effect of epinephrine from a clinical registry using Bayesian network with time-sequence constraints. Methods. We analyzed a prospective regional registry of OHCA where a prehospital advanced life support (ALS) protocol named “Smart ALS (SALS)” was gradually implemented from July 2015 to December 2016. Using Bayesian network, a causal structure was estimated. The effect of epinephrine and SALS program was modelled based on the structure using extended Cox-regression and logistic regression, respectively. Results. Among 4324 patients, SALS was applied to 2351 (54.4%) and epinephrine was administered in 1644 (38.0%). Epinephrine was associated with faster ROSC rate in nonshockable rhythm (HR: 2.02, 6.94, and 7.43; 95% CI: 1.08–3.78, 4.15–11.61, and 2.92–18.91, respectively, for 1–10, 11–20, and &gt;20 minutes) while it was associated with slower rate up to 20 minutes in shockable rhythm (HR: 0.40, 0.50, and 2.20; 95% CI: 0.21–0.76, 0.32–0.77, and 0.76–6.33). SALS was associated with increased prehospital ROSC and neurologic recovery in noncardiac etiology (HR: 5.36 and 2.05; 95% CI: 3.48–8.24 and 1.40–3.01, respectively, for nonshockable and shockable rhythm). Conclusions. Epinephrine was associated with faster ROSC rate in nonshockable rhythm but slower rate in shockable rhythm up to 20 minutes. SALS was associated with improved prehospital ROSC and neurologic recovery in noncardiac etiology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Catalytic ozonation is a new method used for removal of NH4OH solution. Therefore, high catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) should be achieved. In this work, we report the synthesis and catalytic performance of Fe2O3-Co3O4 modified dolomite in the catalytic ozonation of NH4OH solution. Dolomite was successfully activated and modified with Fe2O3 and Co3O4. Firstly, dolomite was activated by heating at 800°C for 3 h and followed by KOH treatment. Activated dolomite was modified with Fe2O3 by the atomic implantation method using FeCl3 as Fe source. Fe2O3 modified dolomite was further modified with Co3O4 by precipitation method. The obtained catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption–desorption (BET), and temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). From SEM image, it was revealed that nano-Fe2O3 and Co3O4 particles with the size of 80–120 nm. Catalytic performance of activated dolomite, Fe2O3 modified dolomite, and Fe2O3-Co3O4 modified dolomite in catalytic ozonation of NH4+ solution was investigated and evaluated. Among 3 tested catalysts, Fe2O3-Co3O4 modified dolomite has the highest NH4+ conversion (96%) and N2 selectivity (77.82%). Selectivity toward N2 over the catalyst was explained on the basis of bond strength M-O in oxides through the standard enthalpy ΔH°f of oxide. Catalyst with lower ΔH°f value has higher N2 selectivity and the order is the following: Co3O4 (ΔH°f of 60 kcal (mole O)) &gt; Fe2O3 (ΔH°f of 70 kcal (mole O)) &gt; MgO (ΔH°f of 170 kcal (mole O)). Moreover, high reduction ability of Fe2O3-Co3O4 modified dolomite could improve the N2 selectivity by the reduction of NO3- to N2 gas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Invasive candidiasis (IC) remains as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the most effective antifungal agents commonly used to treat this infection. However, it induces severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, cardiac alterations, nausea, fever, and liver damage. The utilization of drug delivery systems has been explored to overcome these limitations. Several AmB lipid formulations have been developed and are currently available in the market. Although they have the ability to reduce the main side effects of free AmB, their high cost, necessity of repeated intravenous injections for successful treatment, and incidence of pulmonary toxicity have limited their use. In the last decades, alginate has gained significant interest in drug delivery applications as a cost-effective strategy to improve the safety and therapeutic effect of toxic drugs. In this work, the clinically relevant drug AmB was encapsulated into alginate microparticles using the emulsification/external gelation method. We hypothesize that this synthesis strategy may positively impact the antifungal efficacy of AmB-loaded MCPs toward Candida albicans cells while reducing the toxicity in human lung cells. To prove this hypothesis, the ability of the microplatform to disrupt the cellular membrane potential was tested and its antifungal effectiveness toward Candida albicans cells was evaluated using the cell counting and plate count methods. Moreover, the toxicity of the microplatform in human lung cells was evaluated using CellTiter 96® AQueous cell viability assay and qualitative diffusion analysis of acridine orange. Our results demonstrated that the platform developed in this work was able to induce antifungal toxicity against Candida albicans yeast cells at the same level of free AmB with minimal toxicity to lung cells, which is one of the main side effects induced by commercial drug delivery systems containing AmB. Overall, our data provides convincing evidence about the effectiveness of the alginate-based microplatform toward Candida albicans cells. In addition, this vehicle may not require several infusions for a successful treatment while reducing the pulmonary toxic effect induced by commercial lipid formulations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been associated to an array of risk factors. Identification of risk factors potentially contribute to predict and reduce mortality rates in the ICU. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with the mortality and to analyze the survival. Method. A cross-sectional study conducted in two clinical and surgical ICU in the state of Sergipe, northeastern Brazil. We enrolled 316 patients with at least 48 h of hospitalization, minimum age of 18 years old, sedated or weaned, with RASS ≥ −3, between July 2017 and April 2018. We categorized data in (1) age and gender, (2) clinical condition, and (3) prevalence of delirium. Data from enrolled patients were collected from enrollment until death or ICU discharge. Patients’ outcomes were categorized in (1) death and (2) nondeath (discharge). Results. Twenty-one percent of participants died. Age (53 ± 17 years vs. 45 ± 18 years, p&lt;0.01), electrolyte disturbance (30.3% vs 18.1%, p=0.029), glycemic index (33.3% vs 18.2%, p=0.008), tube feeding (83.3% vs 67.1%, p=0.01), mechanical ventilation (50% vs 35.7%, p=0.035), sedation with fentanyl (24.2 vs 13.6, p=0.035), use of insulin (33.8% vs 21.7%, p=0.042), and higher Charlson score (2.61 vs 2.17, p=0.041) were significantly associated with death on the adjusted model. However, the regression model indicated that patients admitted from the emergency (HR = 0.40, p=0.006) and glycemic index alterations (HR = 1.68, p=0.047) were associated with mortality. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.540) in survival between patients with and without delirium, based on the survival analysis and length of hospitalization. Conclusion. The prevalence of death was 21%, and age, electrolyte disturbance, glycemic index, tube feeding, mechanical ventilation, sedation with fentanyl, use of insulin, and higher Charlson score were associated with mortality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder. Shikonin, the active component of Lithospermum erythrorhizon extract, exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of shikonin on proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine in patients with AD. Ten patients with AD who were allergic to house dust mite (HDM) and seven healthy controls were recruited in this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and CD14+ cells were further selected and differentiated to dendritic cells. Dendritic cells stimulated using Der p 2, the major HDM allergen, were cotreated with shikonin for 24 hours, and dexamethasone was used as a control. Culture supernatants were collected, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations were analyzed using a multiplex assay system. Shikonin significantly inhibited Der p 2-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-9, and IL-17A; monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1; macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α; MIP-1β; and Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (RANTES). The inhibitory effects of shikonin on IL-9, MIP-1β, and RANTES expression were stronger than those of dexamethasone. Therefore, Shikonin can be considered a promising drug for AD treatment because it inhibits different inflammatory cytokines expression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over the last decades, there has been an increasing need to discover new diagnostic RA biomarkers, other than the current serologic biomarkers, which can assist early diagnosis and response to treatment. The purpose of this study was to analyze the serum peptidomic profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The study included 35 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 35 patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) as the disease control (DC), and 35 healthy controls (HC). All participants were subjected to serum peptidomic profile analysis using magnetic bead (MB) separation (MALDI-TOF-MS). The trial showed 113 peaks that discriminated RA from OA and 101 peaks that discriminated RA from HC. Moreover, 95 peaks were identified and discriminated OA from HC; 38 were significant (p&lt;0.05) and 57 nonsignificant. The genetic algorithm (GA) model showed the best sensitivity and specificity in the three trials (RA versus HC, OA versus HC, and RA versus OA). The present data suggested that the peptidomic pattern is of value for differentiating individuals with RA from OA and healthy controls. We concluded that MALDI-TOF-MS combined with MB is an effective technique to identify novel serum protein biomarkers related to RA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To systematically review the evidence available on the effects of art therapy and music therapy interventions in patients with breast cancer. Design. Systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, and Cochrane Central databases. Articles were scanned using the following keywords: “art therapy” or “music therapy” and “breast cancer” or “breast neoplasms,” “breast carcinoma,” “breast tumor,” and “mammary cancer.” Only RCTs published in English, with a control group and experimental group, and presenting pre-/post-therapy results were included. PRISMA guidelines for this systematic review were followed. Results. Twenty randomized controlled trials matched the eligibility criteria. Nine studies evaluated the effect of art therapy, and eleven evaluated the effect of music therapy. Improvements were measured in stress, anxiety, depression reduction, pain, fatigue, or other cancer-related somatic symptoms’ management. Overall, the results show that art therapy was oriented towards the effects on quality of life and emotional symptoms while music therapy is the most often applied for anxiety reduction purposes during or before surgeries or chemotherapy sessions. Conclusion. Art and music therapies show effective opportunities for breast cancer patients to reduce negative emotional state and improve the quality of life and seem to be promising nonmedicated treatment options in breast oncology. However, more detailed and highly descriptive single therapy and primary mental health outcome measuring RCTs are necessary to draw an evidence-based advise for the use of art and music therapies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Though there are several prognostic models, there is no protein-related prognostic model. The aim of this study is to identify possible prognostic-related proteins in bladder urothelial carcinoma and to try to predict the prognosis of bladder urothelial carcinoma based on these proteins. Methods. Profile data and corresponding clinical traits were obtained from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression. Survival-associated protein in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients were estimated with Kaplan-Meier (KM) test and COX regression analysis. The potential molecular mechanisms and properties of these bladder urothelial carcinoma-specific proteins were also explored with the help of computational skills. The risk score model was validated in different clinical traits. Sankey diagram representation is for protein correlation. A new prognostic-related risk model based on proteins was developed by using multivariable COX analysis. Next, the alteration of the corresponding genes to the 6 prognostic-related proteins was analyzed. Finally, the relation between the corresponding genes and the immune infiltration was analyzed using the TIMER. Results. Six proteins were identified to be associated with the prognosis of bladder urothelial carcinoma. A prognostic signature based on proteins (BECLIN, EGFR, PKCALPHA, SRC, ANNEXIN1, and AXL) performed moderately in prognostic predictions. The alteration of corresponding genes was in 31(24%) sequenced cases. ANXA1, AXL, and EGFR were positively related to CD8+ T cell. Conclusion. Our results screened six proteins of clinical significance. The importance of a personalized protein signature model in the recognition, surveillance. The abnormal expression of six prognostic-related proteins may be caused by corresponding gene alteration. Furthermore, these proteins may affect survival via the immune infiltration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to investigate genetic structures and expression of blaOXA-58 gene in five Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered from two hospitals in southern Vietnam during 2012-2014. A. baumannii isolates were identified by automated microbiology systems and confirmed by PCR. All isolates were characterized as multidrug resistant by antimicrobial testing using the disk diffusion method. Four imipenem susceptible and one nonsusceptible isolates (MIC&gt;32 μg·ml-1) were identified by E-test. PCR amplification of blaOXA-58 gene upstream and downstream sequences revealed the presence of ISAba3 at both locations in one multidrug-resistant isolate. Semiquantitation of blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-58 gene expression was performed by the 2-ΔΔCt method. The blaOXA-51 gene expression of five isolates showed little difference, but the isolate bearing ISAba3-blaOXA-58-ISAba3 exhibited significantly higher blaOXA-58 mRNA level. Higher β-lactamases activity in periplasmic than cytoplasmic fraction was found in most isolates. The isolate overexpressing blaOXA-58 gene possessed very high periplasmic enzyme activity. In conclusion, the A. baumannii isolate bearing ISAba3-blaOXA-58 gene exhibited high resistance to imipenem, corresponding to an overexpression of blaOXA-58 gene and very high periplasmic β-lactamase activity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Predictive indices like the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) have been developed to estimate the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for a rapid improvement of morbid obesity and its comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD. A decreased reoccurrence of CVD after metabolic surgery has been reported by several studies. However, studies utilizing predictive indices for CVD risk in CVD-free morbid-obese patients who undertook laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are lacking. Here, we use AIP as a tool to evaluate the improvement in CVD risk post-LSG in morbid-obese people who had no history of CVD. Method. We compared baseline, 6- and 12-month post-LSG score of AIP, vascular age, circulating biochemical markers related to CVD in two groups of BMI and age-matched morbid-obese participants with and without T2D. Results. At baseline, people with T2D had significantly higher AIP both, with morbid obesity (0.23±0.06, p&lt;0.001) and normal weight (0.022±0.05, p&lt;0.001) compared to their BMI-matched without T2D group. People with morbid obesity had low AIP (−0.083±0.06). Vascular age was significantly higher in people with morbid obesity and T2D (65.8±3.7year, p&lt;0.0001) compared to morbid obesity (37.9±2.6 year). After one year, AIP was significantly reduced compared to baseline score in people with morbid obesity with/without T2D, respectively (−0.135±0.07, p=0.003; and −0.36±0.04, p=0.0002). Conclusion. Our data illuminates AIP as a reliable predictive index for CVD risk in morbid-obese people who had no history of CVD. Moreover, AIP accurately distinguishes between morbid obesity with T2D and morbid obesity and showed a rapid and significant reduction in CVD risk after LSG in people who had no history of CVD. This is a ClinicalTrials.gov registered trial (Reference NCT03038373).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) fatty rat is a novel animal model of type 2 diabetes with obesity. SDT fatty rats develop hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and other diabetic complications including ocular disorders; however, diabetic cataract formation in SDT fatty rats has not been fully investigated. The aim of the current study was to investigate the characteristics of cataract in the SDT fatty rats. The mean body weight of SDT fatty rats is larger than that of age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and control animals until 8 weeks of age, and thereafter the growing speed decreased until the end of observation at 16 weeks of age. Blood glucose levels in SDT fatty rats were significantly higher than those in SD rats throughout the observational period. Slit-lamp examination revealed that no rats showed cataract formation at 5 weeks of age; however, SDT fatty rats gradually developed cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract, both of which are the common types of cataract in patients with type 2 diabetes. The levels of glucose, sorbitol, and fructose were higher in the lens tissues of SDT fatty rats in comparison with that of SD rats. Furthermore, the level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was higher in the lens of SDT fatty rats than in that of SD rats. By contrast, total glutathione (GSH) concentration was lower in the lens of SDT fatty rats than in that of SD rats. The present study demonstrated that the cataractogenesis in SDT fatty rats resembled human diabetic cataract formation, indicating that SDT fatty rats serve as a potential animal model in researches on human cataract associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Interstitial pregnancy (IP) is an ectopic pregnancy (EP) located in the portion of the fallopian tube that penetrates the uterine muscular layer. Incidence increased in the last two decades with the widespread use of the assisted reproductive techniques. It is estimated in 1-6% of all the EPs, with a maternal mortality rate of 2.0-2.5%. Clinical presentation, gestational age at diagnosis, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels, ultrasound features, and patient preference, should be considered to determine the best management: surgical, medical treatment, or close observation. We report two cases of IP successfully managed with systemic MTX and Mifepristone: in one case β-hCG was &gt;10.000 mIU/mL and a vital embryo was present. Materials and Methods. A literature search was carried out on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PUBMED. We identified two cases of IP referred to the Institute for Maternal and Child Burlo Garofolo, Trieste. Data related to clinical presentation, β-hCG, and ultrasound scan at the moment of the diagnosis were recorded. In one of the cases, the β-hCG level was &gt;10.000 mIU/mL, and a vital embryo was testified at an ultrasound scan. The patient was asymptomatic and she was treated using multidose systemic Methotrexate (MTX) combined with Mifepristone. In the second case, in the presence of a clinically stable patient with β−hCG&gt;10.000 mIU/mL, it was chosen that the administration of Mifepristone combined with a double dose of MTX. β-hCG levels and ultrasound examinations were performed weekly until a complete resolution of the IP. Results. In the first case, β-hCG dropped down in 5 days and became undetachable in 30 days. In the second case, β-hCG became undetectable in 47 days. The first-line therapy in asymptomatic women could be addressed to a combined protocol, consisting of a systemic multidose MTX regimen with a single oral dose of Mifepristone. Conclusions. Clinical management of IP remains a debated topic. In selected cases, a systemic multidose MTX regimen combined with a single oral dose of Mifepristone could be considered also in the presence of high serum β-hCG.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cloud data centers consume huge amount of electrical energy bringing about in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation utilizes live migration of virtual machines (VMs) to transfer a VM among physical servers in order to improve the utilization of resources and energy efficiency in cloud data centers. Most of the current VM consolidation approaches tend to aggressive-migrate for some types of applications such as large capacity application such as speech recognition, image processing, and decision support systems. These approaches generate a high migration thrashing because VMs are consolidated to servers according to VM’s instant resource usage without considering their overall and long-term utilization. The proposed approach, dynamic consolidation with minimization of migration thrashing (DCMMT) which prioritizes VM with high capacity, significantly reduces migration thrashing and the number of migrations to ensure service-level agreement (SLA) since it keeps VMs likely to suffer from migration thrashing in the same physical servers instead of migrating. We have performed experiments using real workload traces compared to existing aggressive-migration-based solutions; through simulations, we show that our approach improves migration thrashing metric by about 28%, number of migrations metric by about 21%, and SLAV metric by about 19%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. To evaluate CNN models’ performance of identifying the clinical images of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and seborrheic keratosis (SK) and to compare their performance with that of dermatologists. Methods. We constructed a Chinese skin diseases dataset which includes 1456 BCC and 1843 SK clinical images and the corresponding medical history. We evaluated the performance using four mainstream CNN structures and transfer learning techniques. We explored the interpretability of the CNN model and compared its performance with that of 21 dermatologists. Results. The fine-tuned InceptionResNetV2 achieved the best performance, with an accuracy and area under the curve of 0.855 and 0.919, respectively. Further experimental results suggested that the CNN model was not only interpretable but also had a performance comparable to that of dermatologists. Conclusions. This study is the first on the assistant diagnosis of BCC and SK based on the proposed dataset. The promising results suggested that CNN model’s performance was comparable to that of expert dermatologists.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) has positioned itself as one of the main public health problems in Mexico. One of the main reasons is it causes microcephaly and other birth defects. The transmission of ZIKV is through Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which are found in a larger space of the national territory. In addition, it can also be transmitted via blood transfusion, sexual relations, and maternal-fetal route. So far, there are no vaccines or specific treatments to deal with this infection. Currently, some new therapeutics such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are able to regulate or suppress transcription in viruses. Therefore, in this project, an in silico siRNA was designed for the 3′UTR region of ZIKV via bioinformatics tools. The designed siRNA was synthesized and transfected into the C6/36 cell line, previously infected with ZIKV in order to assess the ability of the siRNA to inhibit viral replication. The designed siRNA was able to inhibit significantly (p&lt;0.05) ZIKV replication; this siRNA could be considered a potential therapeutic towards the disease that causes ZIKV and the medical problems generated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Medicinal plants have been used as a source of effective and safe alternative therapeutic agents for various ailments including inflammation. In fact, the aim of this study is to assess the topical anti-inflammatory and antioxidative potential effects of Cucurbita pepo (pumpkin), Linum usitatissimum (linseed), and Opuntia ficus indica (prickly pear) oils on acute inflammation using carrageenan-induced paw edema model. The study was conducted on 36 rats splitted in 6 groups: a normal control group and 5 carrageenan-treated groups (1%), each treated with either a normal saline, the reference drug (“Inflocine®” 2 mg/paw), pumpkin, linseed, or prickly pear oils (25 μl/paw). The response to these treatments was mainly assessed by the measuring of edema paw size, hematological and biochemical analysis, oxidative stress testing, and histological study. All the studied seed oils especially prickly pear oil proved to be efficient in treating acute inflammation. The oil-treated groups revealed a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in the clinical signs of inflammation, hematological parameters (white blood cells and platelets), concentrations of CRP and fibrinogen, and congestion compared to the normal saline-treated group. The results also showed that the tested oils, endowed with a radical scavenging ability, could significantly increase the activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx in carrageenan-treated skin by reducing the lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation (TBARS, AOPP). The anti-inflammatory effect of the tested oils was closely related to both their antioxidant properties as well as their bioactive compounds (polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, and phytosterols). For the first time, the findings of the current study highlight the “in vivo” anti-inflammatory property of pumpkin, linseed, and prickly pear oils on carrageenan-induced acute inflammation by regulating inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress markers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The treatment goal for spinal cord injury (SCI) is to repair neurites and suppress cellular apoptosis. This study is to investigate the effects of nuclear heme oxidase-1 (HO-1) on the acute spinal cord injury and the related mechanisms. The rat model of the SCI was established. On day 7, before model establishment, the adenovirus vector carrying nuclear HO-1 (Ad-GFP-HO-1CΔ23) was injected into the animals into the tenth thoracic spine (T10) segment by the intrathecal injection. Starting from after the model establishment to day 28, the recovery of motor function was assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scoring method. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect the expression patterns of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. HE and Nissl staining methods were used to evaluate the structural damage and the number of surviving neurons near the injured area. The TUNEL method was conducted to evaluate the apoptotic degree. Protein expression levels were detected with the Western blot analysis. The BBB assay scores in the nuclear HO-1 group were significantly higher than the blank and adenovirus control groups. Moreover, compared to the blank and adenovirus control groups, the neuronal apoptosis in the nuclear HO-1 group was significantly alleviated. Furthermore, the expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, i.e., CHOP, GRP78, and caspase-12, were significantly decreased in the nuclear HO-1 group. Nuclear HO-1 significantly improves the SCI, promotes the functional recovery, inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum stress, and alleviates the apoptotic process after SCI.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To investigate the roles of ER stress in Kupffer cells (KCs) and KC-derived TNF-α in the apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Methods. A rat model of liver fibrosis was established. Liver and blood serum samples were collected. Liver function assays, Masson staining, Sirius Red staining, ELISAs, and TUNEL and immunohistochemical staining were performed. Liver function, liver fibrosis, KC phenotype, inflammatory factors, and number of active HSCs were investigated. KCs were isolated, treated with tunicamycin, and then, cocultured with primary hepatic stellate cells. ELISAs, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and Western blotting were performed. KC phenotype, inflammatory factors, HSC apoptosis, and TNF-R1/caspase 8 pathway activity were examined. Results. ER stress in KCs reduced the levels of liver function markers, reduced the degree of liver fibrosis, and increased the number of KCs with the M1 phenotype and the expression of TNF-α. The increase in KC-derived TNF-α reduced the number of active HSCs and increased the activity of TNF-R1/caspase 8. Furthermore, ER stress in KCs promoted the polarization of KCs towards the M1 phenotype and increased the expression of TNF-α. The increase in KC-derived TNF-α triggered the apoptosis of HSCs and the activation of TNF-R1/caspase 8 in vitro, which was consistent with the in vivo results. Conclusion. ER stress in KCs promotes the polarization of these cells towards the M1 phenotype and increases the expression of TNF-α. Then, the increase in KC-derived TNF-α triggers the apoptosis of HSCs through TNF-R1/caspase 8.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Feng-Min Li</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xiao-Wei Gao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There are a lot of bacteria in the environment, and Gram-positive bacteria are the most common ones. Some Gram-positive bacteria are very harmful to the human body, so it is significant to predict Gram-positive bacterial protein subcellular location. And identification of Gram-positive bacterial protein subcellular location is important for developing effective drugs. In this paper, a new Gram-positive bacterial protein subcellular location dataset was established. The amino acid composition, the gene ontology annotation information, the hydropathy dipeptide composition information, the amino acid dipeptide composition information, and the autocovariance average chemical shift information were selected as characteristic parameters, then these parameters were combined. The locations of Gram-positive bacterial proteins were predicted by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, and the overall accuracy (OA) reached 86.1% under the Jackknife test. The overall accuracy (OA) in our predictive model was higher than those in existing methods. This improved method may be helpful for protein function prediction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To assess the agreement between the qualitative clinical method and the quantitative photographic method of evaluating normal and abnormal ocular versions in patients with inactive Graves’ orbitopathy (GO). Methods. Forty-two patients with inactive GO had their ocular versions evaluated clinically according to three categories: normal, moderate alterations (−1 or −2 hypofunction), and severe alterations (−3 or −4 hypofunction). The subjects were photographed in the 9 positions of gaze, and the extent (mm) of eye movement in each position was estimated using Photoshop® and ImageJ and converted into degrees with a well-established method. The agreement between the two methods (qualitative vs. quantitative) for classifying ocular versions as normal or abnormal was assessed. Results. The mean quantitative measurements of versions were significantly different for each clinical category (normal, moderate alterations, and severe alterations) in the following five positions: abduction, adduction, elevation in abduction, elevation, and elevation in adduction (p&lt;0.001). No such pattern was observed for the three infraversion positions (depression in abduction, p=0.573; depression, p=0.468; depression in adduction, p=0.268). Conclusion. The agreement was strong between the quantitative photographic method and the qualitative clinical method of classifying ocular versions, especially in lateral and supraversions, which are typically affected in GO. Digital photography is recommended for the assessment of ocular versions due to its practicality, suitability for telemedicine applications, and ease of monitoring during follow-up. This trial is registered with NCT03278964.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Diabetic neuropathy is one of the clinical syndromes characterized by pain and substantial morbidity primarily due to a lesion of the somatosensory nervous system. The burden of diabetic neuropathy is related not only to the complexity of diabetes but also to the poor outcomes and difficult treatment options. There is no specific treatment for diabetic neuropathy other than glycemic control and diligent foot care. Although various metabolic pathways are impaired in diabetic neuropathy, enhanced cellular oxidative stress is proposed as a common initiator. A mechanism-based treatment of diabetic neuropathy is challenging; a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy will help to develop strategies for the new and correct diagnostic procedures and personalized interventions. Thus, we review the current knowledge of the pathophysiology in diabetic neuropathy. We focus on discussing how the defects in metabolic and vascular pathways converge to enhance oxidative stress and how they produce the onset and progression of nerve injury present in diabetic neuropathy. We discuss if the mechanisms underlying neuropathy are similarly operated in type I and type II diabetes and the progression of antioxidants in treating diabetic neuropathy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The planning stages of dredging require comprehensive and detailed analyses. Identifying the dredging environment is one of the important points. A three-dimensional (3D) geological modeling technology has been shown to be a robust tool for representing and analyzing the conditions of geology. From a general perspective, a 3D model is established by some spatial surfaces. Based on a dredging project, this study investigated the estimation capability of an interpolation method of triangulation combined with BP neural network, for modeling a rock layer surface. The performance of the proposed model is compared with some conventional methods in the literature. The results showed that this interpolation method is effective to be employed for surface modeling of the rock layer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background/Objectives. This systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between pancreatitis and IBD. Methods. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were systematically searched for correlative studies till 2 November 2019. RevMan5.3 was used to estimate relevance. Results. Three studies with 166008 participants were included. The risk of pancreatitis significantly increased in the patients with CD (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.70-4.28; P&lt;0.00001) and UC (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.26; P&lt;0.00001). Increased risks of CD (OR, 12.90; 95% CI, 5.15-32.50; P&lt;0.00001) and UC (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.00-7.86; P=0.05) were found in patients with chronic pancreatitis. As for patients with acute pancreatitis, there were significant association of CD (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.90-7.60; P=0.0002), but were not UC. Conclusions. The evidence confirmed an association between pancreatitis and IBD. When pancreatitis patients have chronic diarrhea and mucus blood stool or IBD patients have repeated abdominal pain and weight loss, they should consult pancreatic and gastrointestinal specialists.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. This retrospective study aims at comparing the variation of peripheral inflammatory markers in recurrent and cancerous vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) and at exploring the potential connection with pathological outcomes. Methods. The patients undergoing carbon dioxide laser surgery with postoperative pathological diagnosis of recurrent vocal fold leukoplakia in the last 5 years were included. The clinical data were collected, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) before and after recurrence and canceration were calculated. Related comparison with two-grade pathological classification was made to evaluate their potential connection with postsurgical histopathology and clinical events. Results. The data of 193 patients were engaged into research, as 111 in the recurrence group (Group A) and 82 in canceration group (Group B). The NLR, PLR, and MLR were significantly increased in canceration event compared to the first (P=0.009,0.004,0.007, respectively) and penultimate (P=0.013,0.041,0.006, respectively) time when the previous pathologies were leukoplakia. When redividing the Group A according to the two-grade pathological classification, the high-risk groups showed statistically higher NLR and PLR values than low-risk groups in the subgroups with grade changing (P=0.016,0.005,0.007,0.005, respectively) and subgroups without grade changing (P=0.020,0.027,0.030,0.029, respectively). Conclusions. NLR, PLR, and MLR are reliable biomarkers in the circulation system which show significantly interrelation with the pathological progression of vocal fold leukoplakia. Presurgical evaluation of NLR, PLR, and MLR may have potential values to indicate the following treatment in clinical practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been reported to be beneficial for patients with acute respiratory failure in intensive care unit (ICU); however, factors that influence the clinical outcome of NIV were unclarified. We aim to determine the factors that predict the failure of NIV in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Setting. Adult mixed ICU in a medical university affiliated hospital. Patients and Methods. A retrospective clinical study using data from critical adult patients with initial NIV admitted to ICU in the period August 2016 to November 2017. Failure of NIV was regarded as patients needing invasive ventilation. Logistic regression was employed to determine the risk factor(s) for NIV, and a predictive model for NIV outcome was set up using risk factors. Results. Of 101 included patients, 50 were unsuccessful. Although more than 20 variables were associated with NIV failure, multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that only ideal body weight (IBW) (OR 1.110 (95%1.027–1.201), P=0.009), the maximal heart rate during NIV period (HR-MAX) (OR 1.024 (1.004–1.046), P=0.021), the minimal respiratory rate during NIV period (RR-MIN) (OR 1.198(1.051–1.365), P=0.007), and the highest body temperature during NIV period (T-MAX) (OR 1.838(1.038–3.252), P=0.037) were independent risk factors for NIV failure. We set up a predictive model based on these independent risk factors, whose area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.783 (95% CI: 0.676–0.899, P&lt;0.001), and the sensitivity and specificity of model were 68.75% and 71.43%, respectively, with the optimal cut-off value of 0.4863. Conclusion. IBW, HR-MAX, RR-MIN, and T-MAX were associated with NIV failure in patients with ARF. A predictive model based on the risk factors could help to discriminate patients who are vulnerable to NIV failure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NLRP11 is a member of the PYD domain-containing, nucleotide-binding oligomerization-domain (NOD-) like receptor (NLR) family. The true stimulus of NLRP11 is still unclear to date, so the current study is built upon NLRP11 induction via adenosine stimulation and that activation can shape adaptive immune responses in a caspase-1-independent manner. We examined the regulation and mechanism of adenosine responsiveness via NLRP11 in human Daudi Burkitt’s B lymphoma cells and their effects on human peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy individuals. NLRP11 was significantly upregulated after induction with adenosine at both the mRNA and protein levels, which led to the interaction of endogenous NLRP11 with the ASC adaptor protein; however, this interaction did not result in the activation of the caspase-1 enzyme. Furthermore, cocultures of NLRP11-expressing Burkitt’s lymphoma cells and naïve human peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes had reduced IFN-γ and IL-17A production, whereas IL-13 and IL-10 cytokines did not change. Interestingly, IFN-γ and IL-17A were recovered after transfection of Burkitt’s lymphoma cells with siRNAs targeting NLRP11. Concomitant with NLRP11 upregulation, we also exhibited that adenosine A2B receptor signaling induced two phosphorylated downstream effectors, pErk1/2 and pAkt (Ser473), but not pAkt (Thr308). Taken together, our data indicate that adenosine is a negative regulator of Th1 and Th17 responses via NLRP11 in an inflammasome-independent manner.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To improve the shear behavior and design applicability of rubber ring perfobond connectors (RPBLs), a new rubber ring that aims to make the shear stiffness of RPBLs controllable was proposed. Firstly, the conceptual design and configuration of the new rubber rings were presented and discussed. Subsequently, finite element (FE) models for modified push-out tests of new RPBLs were established based on the validated modeling method. The initial shear stiffness is dominated by the horizontal projected contact area between hole walls and concrete dowels. γ is defined as the ratio of the horizontal projected length of hollows to the diameter of holes. The shear stiffness of new RPBLs is about 35%, 60%, and 82% of the shear stiffness of PBLs when γ equals 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75, respectively. Employing the new rubber rings with varying central angles on conventional PBLs is feasible to obtain the required stiffness for RPBLs. Further, the effects of the number of sectors, the size of side wings, the central angle of hollows, the offset angle, and the thickness of rubber rings were analysed. Based on the numerical results, the proper thickness of side wings is no larger than 2 mm. The thicker side wing could reduce the confinement effects provided by surrounding concrete on concrete dowels, resulting in a drop of the yield load of new RPBLs. The number of sectors is suggested to be no less than 6 so that the shear behavior of new RPBLs is irrelevant to the offset angle. Besides, the shear stiffness is not related to the thickness of rubber rings. To improve the yield load of RPBLs and obtain the moderate recovered stiffness, the thickness of rubber rings is recommended as 2 mm. Finally, the expression for the shear stiffness of new RPBLs was proposed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Addisonian crisis is the life-threatening acute manifestation of adrenal insufficiency due to absolute or relative glucocorticoid deficiency. Adrenal haemorrhage is a rare condition of unknown incidence with the risk of adrenal insufficiency and death, not uncommonly first being diagnosed on the pathologists table. We report the case of a 68-year-old female patient with respiratory tract infection suffering acute life-threatening adrenal insufficiency caused by bilateral adrenal haemorrhages following orthopedic surgery while taking anticoagulation therapy. The patient rapidly deteriorated with hypotension, showing how important it is to consider a possible Addisonian crisis when this scenario occurs, especially with precipitating factors such as anticoagulant therapy, sepsis, or surgery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The storage and preparation of corn for animal feed inevitably lead to lipid and protein peroxidation. Granulosa cells play an important role in follicular development in the ovaries, and hen laying productivity is likely to be dependent on follicle health and number. We hypothesized that oxidized oil and protein induce apoptosis via oxidative stress in laying hen granulosa cells. A sample of 360 38-week-old Lohmann commercial laying hens was used in a 2×2 factorial design for 8 weeks. Dietary treatments included dietary oil (fresh corn oil (FO) or oxidized corn oil (OO)) and corn gluten meal (fresh corn gluten meal (FP) or oxidized corn gluten meal (OP)). Productivity, ovarian histology, granulosa cell apoptosis, and indicators of oxidative stress were evaluated in all groups. Both dietary OO and OP decreased egg production and the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of laying hens. Flow cytometry, TUNEL, and real-time PCR revealed that both dietary OO and OP induced granulosa cell apoptosis in prehierarchical and hierarchical follicles. Furthermore, dietary OO and OP caused oxidative stress in prehierarchical and hierarchical follicles, as indicated by the downregulation of antioxidant-related-gene expression. Moreover, forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), and c-Jun NH2 kinase (JNK) are involved in potential apoptosis regulation pathways in the granulosa cells of laying hens fed OO and OP, as indicated by the upregulation of FoxO1 expression and downregulation of ERK/JNK expression. These results indicate that OO and OP induce granulosa cell apoptosis via oxidative stress, and the combined use of OO and OP aggravates the adverse effects of oxidative stress in laying hens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease. Oxidative stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced from carbohydrate fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract exert positive regulatory effects on inflammation and kidney injuries. However, it is unclear whether SCFAs can prevent and ameliorate DN. In the present study, we evaluated the role and mechanism of the three main SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced type2 diabetes (T2D) and DN mouse models and in high glucose-induced mouse glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs), to explore novel therapeutic strategies and molecular targets for DN. We found that exogenous SCFAs, especially butyrate, improved hyperglycemia and insulin resistance; prevented the formation of proteinuria and an increase in serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and cystatin C; inhibited mesangial matrix accumulation and renal fibrosis; and blocked NF-κB activation in mice. SCFAs also inhibited high glucose-induced oxidative stress and NF-κB activation and enhanced the interaction between β-arrestin-2 and I-κBα in GMCs. Specifically, the beneficial effects of SCFAs were significantly facilitated by the overexpression GPR43 or imitated by a GPR43 agonist but were inhibited by siRNA-GPR43 in GMCs. These results support the conclusion that SCFAs, especially butyrate, partially improve T2D-induced kidney injury via GPR43-mediated inhibition of oxidative stress and NF-κB signaling, suggesting SCFAs may be potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of DN.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pomacea canaliculata, known as an invasive freshwater snail, is also called a golden apple snail; its survival and expansion are greatly affected by temperature. In this study, high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to perform comparative transcriptome analysis on the muscular tissue (G_M) of snails in Guangdong and Hunan. Differential gene screening was performed with FDR &lt;0.05 and |log2FoldChange| &gt;1 as the threshold, and a total of 1,368 differential genes were obtained (671 genes showed upregulation in snails from Guangdong, and 697 genes displayed upregulation in snails from Hunan). Fifteen genes were identified as candidate genes for the cold hardiness of Pomacea canaliculata. Among them, three genes were involved in energy metabolism (glycogen synthase, 1; DGK, 1; G6PD, 1); seven genes were involved in homeostasis regulation (HSP70, 2; BIP, 1; GPX, 1; GSTO 1, G6PD, 1; caspase-9, 1); two genes were involved in amino acid metabolism (glutamine synthetase, 1; PDK, 1); and four genes were involved in membrane metabolism (inositol-3-phosphate synthase, 1; Na+/K+-ATPase, 1; calcium-binding protein, 2). This study presents the molecular mechanisms for the cold hardiness of Pomacea canaliculata, which could provide a scientific basis for the forecast and prevention of harm from Pomacea canaliculata.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The main intent of this paper is to innovate a new construction of modified Lupaş-Jain operators with weights of some Beta basis functions whose construction depends on σ such that σ0=0 and infx∈0,∞σ′x≥1. Primarily, for the sequence of operators, the convergence is discussed for functions belong to weighted spaces. Further, to prove pointwise convergence Voronovskaya type theorem is taken into consideration. Finally, quantitative estimates for the local approximation are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Water pollution caused by oil leakage and oily wastewater has become a serious environmental problem. Therefore, it is important to develop an efficient material to remove oil from water. Given the cost and efficiency, the membrane with superhydrophobicity is the most used material for the separation of oil/water mixtures. However, many works have been done through modification with a fluorinated reagent, causing high cost and damage to the environment. In this work, a simple and fast two-step method is employed to achieve a superhydrophobic hair-like nanowire membrane. Through the alkali-assisted oxidation process and modification with nonfluorinated low surface energy chemical, the so-obtained membrane (denoted as SHM), with the water contact angle of about 164°, exhibits excellent separation efficiency for binary mixtures of water and oils (toluene, hexane, gasoline, and so on). Meantime, this membrane also exhibits excellent durability and reusability in the long-term separation process, indicating its great potential for practical application in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Proximal hamstring tendon injuries occur frequently in the athletic population resulting in varying degrees of functional disability depending on severity of injury. The purpose of our case vignette is to describe a surgical technique and clinical outcome for open proximal hamstring tendon repair with a confirmed biomechanically sound construct. We also describe and summarize the current literature recommendations for proximal hamstring injuries. We present a case and surgical technique report on a 27-year-old male who suffered a proximal hamstring tendon rupture. Utilizing a double row all-knotless suture bridge construct with a total of four anchors and six suture limbs allowed for anatomic footprint coverage and strength. Two years of clinical follow-up was obtained evaluating hip and knee range of motion, strength, and functional ability. Our patient underwent uncomplicated open surgical repair and returned to all activity at four months following surgery. Range of motion and strength returned to preoperative levels at the four-month postoperative mark. The use of a reproducible double row all-knotless suture bridge technique provided adequate strength and stability in the setting of a proximal hamstring tendon rupture. Open and endoscopic surgical techniques performed acutely both show positive postoperative subjective outcomes as well as a high likelihood of returning to sport. Controversy remains present in regard to the repair technique as well as postoperative bracing and physical therapy recommendations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The proper treatment of penetrating abdominal wounds has been a controversial topic, and the preferred regimen has evolved over time. In recent years, many trauma centers have started using diagnostic laparoscopy in stable trauma patients in an effort to reduce the incidence of nontherapeutic laparotomy. This is more commonly seen in solid organ injuries, and its role is less clearly defined for hollow visceral injuries. Case Presentation. A 19-year-old male presented with a gunshot wound (GSW) to the abdomen with mild peritoneal signs and computed tomography (CT) findings. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with the repair of five lacerations to intra-abdominal organs including the sigmoid colon, rectum, bladder, and small bowel. Discussion. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature detailing such a GSW repair. Abdominal GSWs have been repaired laparoscopically in the past, but none have elaborated on the repair of multiple defects of bowel and/or bladder. Conclusion. Therapeutic laparoscopy can be considered in selected cases of penetrating abdominal trauma. Laparoscopy offers several advantages over laparotomy including decreased mortality, complication rate, and length of stay.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend excisional biopsies for the diagnosis of lymphomas. However, resection biopsies in all patients who are suspected of having malignant lymph nodes may cause unnecessary injury and increase medical costs. We investigated the usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission/computed tomography- (18F-FDG-PET/CT-) based radiomics analysis for differentiating between lymphomatous lymph nodes (LLNs) and cancerous lymph nodes (CLNs). Methods. Using texture analysis, radiomic parameters from the 18F-FDG-PET/CT images of 492 lymph nodes (373 lymphomatous lymph nodes and 119 cancerous lymph nodes) were extracted with the LIFEx package. Predictive models were generated from the six parameters with the largest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in PET or CT images in the training set (70% of the data), using binary logistic regression. These models were applied to the test set to calculate predictive variables, including the combination of PET and CT predictive variables (PREcombination). The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to compare the differentiating ability of the predictive variables. Results. Compared with the pathological diagnosis of the patient’s primary tumor, the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PREcombination in differentiating between LLNs and CLNs were 0.95, 91.67%, 94.29%, and 92.96%, respectively. Moreover, PREcombination could effectively distinguish LLNs caused by various lymphoma subtypes (Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) from CLNs, with the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy being 0.85 and 0.90, 77.78% and 77.14%, 97.22% and 88.89%, and 90.74% and 83.10%, respectively. Conclusions. Radiomics analysis of 18F-FDG-PET/CT images may provide a noninvasive, effective method to distinguish LLN and CLN and inform the choice between fine-needle aspiration and excision biopsy for sampling suspected lymphomatous lymph nodes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, used by cardiologists to treat arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation (A fib) and ventricular fibrillation. However, amiodarone is associated with endocrine dysfunction including both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. In the literature, two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) were described: AIT-1 and AIT-2. Mixed AIT also called AIT type 3 (AIT-3) has been described in the literature when the cases do not have a typical presentation. In order to differentiate different types of AIT, various clinical, biochemical, and radiological tools have been proposed. The use of 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (sestaMIBI) uptake on scintigraphy (99m-STS) has been suggested in the literature in only few studies (no large retrospective or prospective studies have been established in the United States). We present a case series describing 5 patients presenting to the University of Arizona with AIT where we used 99m-STS to assess in diagnosis and treatment of different types of AIT followed by a review of the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (AP), as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been used for thousands of years in China. In this paper, the botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, analytical methods, quality control, pharmacological effects, and toxicity of AP were reviewed. It can provide a reference for the further research and lay a foundation for the rational clinical application of AP. The relevant information on AP was collected from scientific databases (such as Baidu Scholar, CNKI, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and SciFinder Scholar), Chinese herbal classics, Chinese Pharmacopoeia, PhD and MSc dissertations, and so on. The components which have been isolated and identified in AP include coumarins, volatile oils, organic acids, terpenes, polysaccharides, flavonoids, sterols, and trace elements. Most of them were analyzed by HPLC and GC. A pharmacological study shows that the AP has extensive pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antirheumatism, sedative and hypnotic, neuroprotection, antioxidation, antitumor, and allergy, and it is widely used in the treatment of the rheumatoid arthritis, knee osteoarthritis, lumbar disc, ankylosing spondylitis, headaches, stroke hemiplegia, Alzheimer’s, and arrhythmia. AP is a valuable natural medicinal plant. So far, significant advances have been made in phytochemistry and pharmacology. Some traditional uses have been demonstrated by modern pharmacology. However, the chemical components and pharmacological effects of AP are complex and varied, and there are different standards for the evaluation of its quality and efficacy. The mechanism of action, the structure-activity relationship among the components, and the potential synergistic and antagonistic effects remain to be studied. At the same time, there are few studies on the specific compounds related to its pharmacodynamics. In order to better develop and utilize AP, we should establish a more reasonable, reliable, and accurate quality control standard and focus on the study of bioactive constituents and the demonstration of their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Niwut Juntavee</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Sasiprapa Kornrum</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction. Monolithic zirconia is able to achieve certain aesthetic, but its durability in resisting fracture has been questioned, as fractures often originate from margins of restoration. This study determined fracture resistance of highly translucent monolithic zirconia crowns with different margin designs in terms of marginal thickness and collar height. Materials and Methods. Zirconia blanks (Ceramill® Zolid HT+) were selected for the fabrication of zirconia crowns according to different designs, including varying margin thicknesses (light chamfer, CL; heavy chamfer, CH) and collar heights (no collar, NC; low collar, LC; high collar, HC), which resulted in CLNC, CLLC, CLHC, CHNC, CHLC, and CHHC groups (15 crowns each). The crowns were seated on a metal die and loaded vertically through round end punch (θ = 10 mm), contacting with inclined planes of cusp in a testing machine with crosshead speed of 0.2 mm/min until fracture. Videos with a rate of 50 frames/second were used to record fracture. Fracture load (N) and durable period (s) were compared for significant differences using ANOVA and Bonferroni test (α = 0.05). Results. The mean ± sd of fracture load (N) and durable time (s) were 3211 ± 778 and 212 ± 47 for CLNC; 3041 ± 1370 and 188 ± 53 for CLLC; 2913 ± 828 and 192 ± 27 for CLHC; 4226 ± 905 and 245 ± 35 for CHNC; 4486 ± 807 and 228 ± 29 for CHLC; and 4376 ± 1043 and 227 ± 37 for CHHC. This indicated that marginal thickness had a significant influence on load-bearing capacity and durable time (p&lt;0.05). No significant impact of collar height was shown, either on load-bearing capacity or durable time (p&gt;0.05). No interaction between two factors was presented (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions. Heavy chamfer margin provided stronger zirconia crown than light chamfer, but both were capable of withstanding fracture load higher than maximum masticatory force. Neither presence nor absence of collar indicated any impact on strength. Fabrication of zirconia crowns with either heavy or light chamfer margin and either presence or absence of collar, with the consideration of emergence profile, should be considered.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The traditional biogas heating system has the disadvantages of a low energy efficiency ratio and high energy consumption. In this study, a solar-untreated sewage source heat pump system (SUSSHPS) was developed for heating a 12 m3 multiphase flow digester (MFD) in Suining, China. To investigate the operating effects, two modes were defined according to the solar fractions in different regions. On the basis of experimental data, thermodynamic calculations and operating simulation analysis were performed, and the solar collector area (Ac) and the minimum length of the sewage double-pipe heat exchanger (lmin) for the two modes were calculated. The results indicated that the Ac and lmin of mode 2 were larger than those of mode 1 at different solar fractions. Additionally, the results suggested that mode 1 can be used at a solar fraction of &lt;0.33, and mode 2 can be used at a solar fraction of &gt;0.5. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation of different biogas heating systems was performed. Two evaluation methods were used for modeling calculations, and the results of the two methods were consistent. The SUSSHPS had the largest comprehensive evaluation value among the four systems. The proposed SUSSHPS can play a significant role in improving current biogas heating systems and promoting the development of biogas projects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Guinea’s reference ranges for biological parameters rely on those of Caucasian values. Variability in reference ranges according to the context is well-documented. We conducted this study for the purpose of future malaria clinical trials that assess the efficacy and safety of malaria drugs. A repeated cross-sectional study was carried out, in an apparently healthy cohort population. Surveys took place in Maferinyah rural community, which is located at 75 km from the capital. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were determined nonparametrically and stood for reference intervals. Reference values were determined separately for males and females according to ranges of age (6-10 years of age; 11-15 years of age; 16-45 years of age). Differences between genders were tested using the Mann-Whitney test, while the Friedman test was performed to test differences within each gender group according to the seasons. A total of 450 volunteers were enrolled. The median age was 13. Males 16-45 years of age had significantly higher hematologic and biochemical values compared to a female of the same age (for hematological parameters: Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration MCHC p≤0.001, Platelets p≤0.001, monocytes p=0.0305, eosinophils p=0.0225; for biochemical parameters: Aspartate aminotransferase AST p≤0.001, Alanine Aminotransferase ALT p≤0.001, creatinine p≤0.001). We noticed significant seasonal variations for all the biochemical parameters and some hematologic parameters (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin MCH, MCHC, Mean Cell volume). This is the first study establishing hematologic and biochemical parameters in Guinea. These findings provide a useful guide for the clinical researchers and care providers. Studies on large scale and in different settings would be also desirable.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Paravertebral muscle (PVM) is considered as a contributing factor of idiopathic scoliosis (IS); collagen is crucial for maintaining the mechanical properties of PVM, but only a few researches have described this field. In this study, we observed the muscle stiffness of PVM and the curvature of the spine by adjusting the content of collagen in PVM of rats and explored the role of collagen in the progression of IS. Methods. 32 female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: neutralizing antibody (NA) group (group 1), normal control group (group 2), IS group (group 3), and IS with NA group (group 4). TGF-β1 NA was injected into PVM in group 1 and group 4, while Normal saline in group 2 and group 3. The Cobb angle and muscle stiffness were measured before and after injection; the rats were sacrificed at one week after injection, and performed histological, Western Blot, and qRT-PCR examinations. Results. X-rays showed that scoliosis occurred in group 1 and relieved in group 4. The stiffness of PVM was decreased significantly on the convex side in group 1, while on the concave side in group 4. The expression of TGF-β1 and COL1 on the concave side in IS rats (group 3) was significantly increased than that in normal rats (group 2), the concentration of COL1 and COL3 in group 3 was significantly higher than that in group 2, and the addition of TGF-β1 NA significantly downregulated COL1 and COL3 in group 1 and group 4. The concentration of COL1 in convex PVM was negatively related to Cobb angle in group 1 and group 2, and in concave PVM was positively related to Cobb angle in group 3 and group 4. However, no significant correlation was found between COL3 and Cobb angle in group 3 and group 4. Conclusions. Asymmetric biomechanical characteristics of PVM was an important etiological factor of IS, which was directly correlated with collagen, it could be adjusted by local intramuscular injecting of TGF-β1 NA, and finally had an effect on the shape of the spine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Purpose. Patients undergoing kidney transplantation surgeries suffer from postoperative pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to use different interventions in addition to modern medicine to reduce their symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of foot reflexology on pain, fatigue, and quality of sleep after kidney transplantation surgery. Materials and Methods. The study was a parallel randomized controlled trial. Patients admitted to the transplantation ward participated in the study. Fifty-three eligible patients were allocated into the foot reflexology group (n = 26) and the control group (n = 27) by using the stratified randomization method. Finally, 25 participants in each group finished the study. The intervention group received foot reflexology for 30 minutes once a day for three consecutive days, and no reflexology was applied in the control group. The intervention started on the second day after surgery. Pain, fatigue, and quality of sleep were measured on the first, second (before intervention), third, fourth, and eleventh days after surgery. Data were collected using visual analogue scale for measuring pain and fatigue and Verran and Snyder-Halpern sleep scale for measuring quality of sleep. Results. In each group, 25 patients finished the study. The mean pain score in the foot reflexology and control groups decreased from 9.44 ± 0.96 and 9.36 ± 0.91 on the day of surgery to 1.32 ± 0.94 and 4.32 ± 1.68 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. The mean fatigue score in the reflexology and control groups decreased from 8.76 ± 1.27 and 8.6 ± 1.26 on the day of surgery to 1.24 ± 1.2 and 3.92 ± 1.63 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. The mean sleep score in the foot reflexology and control groups increased from 33.38 ± 11.22 and 39.59 ± 12.8 on the day of surgery to 69.43 ± 12.8 and 56.27 ± 8.03 on the eleventh day after surgery, respectively. While pain, fatigue, and sleep quality scores improved in both groups, those in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement compared with the control group (P&lt;0.001). No significant difference was found between the two groups in the use of acetaminophen on the first, second, third, fourth, and eleventh days after surgery (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion. Foot reflexology may reduce pain and fatigue and improve sleep quality of patients after kidney transplantation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fault diagnosis is essentially the identification of multiple fault modes. How to extract sensitive features and improve diagnostic accuracy is the key to fault diagnosis. In this paper, a new manifold learning method (Mass Laplacian Discriminant Analysis, MLDA) is proposed. Firstly, it is assumed that each data point in the space is a point with mass, and the mass is defined as the number of data points in a certain area. Then, the idea of universal gravitation is introduced to calculate the virtual universal gravitation between data points. Based on the Laplace eigenmaps algorithm, the gravitational Laplacian matrix between the same kind of data and the heterogeneous data is obtained, and the discriminant function is constructed by the ratio of the virtual gravitation between the heterogeneous data and the virtual gravitation between the similar data; the projection function with the largest discriminant function value is the optimal feature mapping function. Finally, based on the mapping function, the eigenvalues of the training data and the test data are calculated, and the softmax algorithm is used to classify the test data. Experiments on gear fault diagnosis show that this method has higher diagnostic accuracy than other manifold learning algorithms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Controlling traffic signals to alleviate increasing traffic pressure is a concept that has received public attention for a long time. However, existing systems and methodologies for controlling traffic signals are insufficient for addressing the problem. To this end, we build a truly adaptive traffic signal control model in a traffic microsimulator, i.e., “Simulation of Urban Mobility” (SUMO), using the technology of modern deep reinforcement learning. The model is proposed based on a deep Q-network algorithm that precisely represents the elements associated with the problem: agents, environments, and actions. The real-time state of traffic, including the number of vehicles and the average speed, at one or more intersections is used as an input to the model. To reduce the average waiting time, the agents provide an optimal traffic signal phase and duration that should be implemented in both single-intersection cases and multi-intersection cases. The co-operation between agents enables the model to achieve an improvement in overall performance in a large road network. By testing with data sets pertaining to three different traffic conditions, we prove that the proposed model is better than other methods (e.g., Q-learning method, longest queue first method, and Webster fixed timing control method) for all cases. The proposed model reduces both the average waiting time and travel time, and it becomes more advantageous as the traffic environment becomes more complex.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Natural macromolecule adsorbing materials are alternatives for remediation of heavy metals’ polluted waters. In this study, sodium alginate composite gel (SACL) was synthesized from sodium alginate (SA), polyethylene glycol oxide (PEO), and nanomaterials to remove wastewater Cu (II) and Cd (II). The adsorption efficiency of SACL was analysed in relation to the contact time, initial concentrations of metal ions, temperature, adsorbent dosage, and solution pH. Three models, i.e., kinetic model, isothermal adsorption model, and thermodynamic model, were used to fit the experimental data. Our results showed that the highest removal rates of Cu (II) and Cd (II) from wastewater were 96.8% and 78%, respectively, under the condition of the best liquid-solid ratio of 12.5 ml·g−1, and the contact time of 180 min (25°C). Overall, the SACL adsorption of Cu (II) and Cd (II) was spontaneous. The adsorption kinetics and the isothermal adsorption were fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and Langmuir equation, respectively. Combined with SEM-EDS and FTIR analysis, results suggested that SACL adsorbs wastewater Cu (II) and Cd (II) mainly through chemical reaction on its surface area. Altogether, this work concludes on SACL as an efficient and ecofriendly adsorbent for wastewater Cu (II) and Cd (II).</dc:description>

<dc:description>A mechanical molecular spring isolator (MMSI) is proposed for the purpose of isolating the low-frequency vibration of a heavy payload. The MMSI is a passive vibration isolation technique mimicking molecular spring isolator characteristics of high-static-low-dynamic stiffness (HSLDS). An MMSI consists of a piston-cylinder container filled with the liquid and some hydraulic spring accumulators. The piston would support a lump of mass and be subjected to a specific external vibration excitation force. Those accumulators can get intercommunication by the liquid to produce the transformation from high static stiffness to low dynamic stiffness. The stiffness model of the MMSI with several identical accumulators is established based on the hydrostatic law. After that, some parameters that significantly influence the stiffness characteristics are studied. Results show that the stiffness property of this kind of MMSI demonstrates a piecewise linearity of three segments. It applies the averaging method to acquire amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency relationships of the piecewise linear vibration isolation system. An inevitable jump phenomenon may occur when the exciting force reaches the critical value. The vibration isolation performance is evaluated by energy transmissibility. Finally, an experimental prototype was designed to carry out quasi-static and dynamic experiments to verify the stiffness model and the dynamic properties as an HSLDS vibration isolator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common degenerative diseases that lead to pain and disability. Oral NSAIDs are effective drugs used to alleviate symptoms in patients with KOA, but they have several important complications, especially in the elderly. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of mesotherapy on pain reduction and improvement of functioning in patients with KOA. Methods. Sixty-two patients with KOA, grade 2-3 of the Kellgren–Lawrence scale, were randomized into two groups: the mesotherapy group, in which two injections were applied with piroxicam at a 10-day interval, and the oral group, in which piroxicam was prescribed for 10 days. The patients were evaluated before the treatment and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after it using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oxford Knee Scare (OKS), and Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC, Persian version). Results. There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics and baseline pain and function scores between the two groups. After 2, 4, and 8 weeks of follow-up, VAS, WOMAC, and OKS scores significantly improved in both groups (in the mesotherapy group: p value &lt;0.001 in all three scores and in the oral group: p value &lt;0.001 in the VAS scale and p value &lt;0.05 in WOMAC and OKS scores). There was no significant difference between the two groups at any time in the VAS score, but improvement in WOMAC and OKS scales in the mesotherapy group was significantly better (p value &lt;0.05 in both scales [p value &lt;0.03 in OKS and p value &lt;0.02 in WOMAC scales]). Side effects in both groups were not serious: limited heart burn in 32.2% of the total subjects in the oral group and pain at the injection site in 3.2% and bruises in 38.7% of the total subjects in the mesotherapy group. Conclusion. Mesotherapy is an effective and safe treatment modality in patients with mild-to-moderate KOA in the short term. This trial is registered with IRCT2017052434113N1.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although the conventional wisdom is that “earlier is better” when it comes to intervention for children with ASD, it is not clear what evidence exists to support this notion. This review examined a group of studies that addressed outcomes for young children with ASD who started early intervention at a range of ages. The review was selective by including only papers that examined the age of initiation of treatment as well as baseline cognitive, language, or adaptive level and, in addition, employed a method to control for the covariance between early ability level and age of beginning intervention. Fourteen studies were identified and then compared on methods and outcomes. The support for “earlier is better” was mixed, but it was clear that complex relationships among predictor variables need to be explored in order to understand the role of age of starting early intervention for later outcomes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the rapid development of high-power tractor, the fault diagnosis of high-power tractor has become more and more important for ensuring the operating safety and efficiency. PSO is an iterative optimization evolutionary algorithm, which can iterate through different particles to find the optimal solution. However, there is only one population in the standard PSO algorithm, and the information exchange between the populations is relatively single, which can easily lead to the stagnation of the development of the population. In this paper, due to high-power tractor diesel engine fault complexity, fault correlation, and multifault concurrency, a multigroup coevolution particle swarm optimization BP neural network for diesel engine fault diagnosis method was proposed. First, the USB-CAN device was used to collect data of 8 items of the diesel engine under five different working conditions, and the data was parsed through the SAE J1939 protocol; then, the BP neural network was reconstructed, and a competitive multiswarm cooperative particle swarm optimizer algorithm (COM-MCPSO) was used to optimize its structure and weights. Finally, the data of optimized neural network under five different fault conditions show that, compared with BP neural network and PSO optimized BP neural network, the fault diagnosis of COM-MCPSO optimized BP neural network not only improves the network training speed, but also enhances generalization ability and improves recognition accuracy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The spatial-wavenumber filter method can extract the specific mode of the Lamb wave, thereby distinguishing the incident wave and the damage reflection wave. This method has been widely studied for damage imaging. However, the diameter of piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensor limits the spatial sampling wavenumber of the linear PZT sensor array, which limits the application of this method because of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. Therefore, the wavenumber filtering range of spatial-wavenumber filter should be less than half of the spatial sampling wavenumber. In this paper, a frequency aliasing based spatial-wavenumber filter for online damage monitoring is proposed. In this method, the wavenumber filtering range is extended to the spatial sampling wavenumber, and two wavenumber results will be calculated as for the frequency aliasing. Subsequently, the wavenumber of the received Lamb wave signal can be obtained according to the average arrival time difference between the two adjacent sensors in the linear PZT sensor array. Finally, the damage is localized using the spatial-wavenumber filter and cruciform PZT sensor array. This method was validated on an epoxy laminate plate. The maximum damage localization errors are less than 2 cm. It is indicated that this method can extend the spatial-wavenumber filtering range to the spatial sampling wavenumber and the application of spatial-wavenumber filter-based online damage monitoring.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. As part of plans to provide help to people in remote and poor areas who have no medical resources, a portable slit-lamp based on a smartphone was proposed. This would help in early screening of cataract diseases. Methods. This means a microlens is designed that would work with a phone’s camera. The phone’s photo taking function is used in capturing the image of the eyes lens to replace the observation system of the desktop slit-lamp. A simplified slit light band was designed. In order for the light source part to meet the portable requirements of the slit-lamp, the adjustable and diffused light functions of the ligaments were removed in this design. Furthermore, the images collected by the smartphone are uploaded to the deep learning cataract screening system, which can achieve real-time and effective screening of cataract. Results. Unlike the desktop slit-lamp, which needs skilled personnel to operate, this device can be easily operated by less-skilled or inexperienced doctors. This eliminates the concerns of inaccurate diagnosis based on the use of unskilled professionals. Due to the portability, ease of use, and simplicity in obtaining crystal images of this device, it serves as a promising platform for nonhospital screening and telemedicine. Conclusions. In this paper, we invented a small portable device for screening cataract. This device is to make screening and diagnosis of cataract in remote areas very fast and effective. It will also solve the problem of inadequate specialized doctors and equipment in those areas as well. Translational Relevance. Smartphones can be used with portable slit-lamps to capture the images of the lens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes a mathematical model, the competing risks method, to investigate highway-rail grade crossing (HRGC) crash frequency and crash severity simultaneously over a 30-year period. The proposed competing risks model is a special type of survival analysis to accommodate the competing nature of multiple outcomes from the same event of interest; in this case, the competing multiple outcomes are crash severities, while event of interest is crash occurrence. Knowledge-gain-based benefits to be discovered through the application of this model and 30-year dataset are as follows: (1) a straightforward and integrated one-step estimation process that considers both crash frequency and severity likelihood in the same model, so direct hazard ranking considering both crash frequency and severity likelihood is possible; (2) interpretative effects of identified covariates from both the direction and magnitude perspectives; and (3) the long-term cumulative effect of contributors with the cumulative incidence function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>CO2 emissions reduction is a top element of transport policy agenda. Among other mitigation policy measures, eco-driving techniques have proven to be effective in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The aim of this paper is to compare the impacts of adopting eco-driving in different cities, road segments, traffic, and driver features. It intends to gain an insight into how city size and driving characteristics can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in order to develop specific eco-driving strategies. Field trials were conducted in two Spanish cities (Madrid and Caceres). 24 drivers, with different driving experiences, drove two different vehicles (petrol and diesel) along roads with different characteristics. The experiment was divided into two periods of 2 weeks; after the first one, drivers received an eco-driving training course. The impacts of eco-driving were measured comparing before and after results. They showed that eco-driving is highly effective in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in both, large-congested and small, cities. Savings between 5% and 12% were achieved. The efficiency increases with road capacity and decreased with city size. Eco-driving appears to be more effective in small, uncongested cities. In addition, limiting speeds on high capacity roads has proven to be a good energy saving measure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To better understand the mechanism of air traffic delay propagation at the system level, an efficient modeling approach based on the epidemic model for delay propagation in airport networks is developed. The normal release rate (NRR) and average flight delay (AFD) are considered to measure airport delay. Through fluctuation analysis of the average flight delay based on complex network theory, we find that the long-term dynamic of airport delay is dominated by the propagation factor (PF), which reveals that the long-term dynamic of airport delay should be studied from the perspective of propagation. An integrated airport-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (ASIRS) epidemic model for air traffic delay propagation is developed from the network-level perspective, to create a simulator for reproducing the delay propagation in airport networks. The evolution of airport delay propagation is obtained by analyzing the phase trajectory of the model. The simulator is run using the empirical data of China. The simulation results show that the model can reproduce the evolution of the delay propagation in the long term and its accuracy for predicting the number of delayed airports in the short term is much higher than the probabilistic prediction method. The model can thus help managers as a tool to effectively predict the temporal and spatial evolution of air traffic delay.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Human emotion recognition has been a major field of research in the last decades owing to its noteworthy academic and industrial applications. However, most of the state-of-the-art methods identified emotions after analyzing facial images. Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has got less attention. However, the advantage of using EEG signals is that it can capture real emotion. However, very few EEG signals databases are publicly available for affective computing. In this work, we present a database consisting of EEG signals of 44 volunteers. Twenty-three out of forty-four are females. A 32 channels CLARITY EEG traveler sensor is used to record four emotional states namely, happy, fear, sad, and neutral of subjects by showing 12 videos. So, 3 video files are devoted to each emotion. Participants are mapped with the emotion that they had felt after watching each video. The recorded EEG signals are considered further to classify four types of emotions based on discrete wavelet transform and extreme learning machine (ELM) for reporting the initial benchmark classification performance. The ELM algorithm is used for channel selection followed by subband selection. The proposed method performs the best when features are captured from the gamma subband of the FP1-F7 channel with 94.72% accuracy. The presented database would be available to the researchers for affective recognition applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The MC-UVE-SPA method is commonly proposed as a variable selection approach for multivariate calibration. However, the SPA tends to select wavelength variables that are sparsely distributed over the wavelength ranges of the variables selected by the MC-UVE algorithm, and the MC-UVE-SPA cascade cannot improve the problem of wavelength point discontinuity. It is addressed in this paper by proposing a moving-window- (MW-) improved MC-UVE-SPA wavelength selection algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the continuity of the selected wavelength variables and thereby better exploits the advantages of the MC-UVE algorithm and the SPA to obtain regression models with high prediction accuracy. The MC-UVE, MC-UVE-SPA, and MC-UVE-SPA-MW algorithms are applied for conducting wavelength variable selection for the NIR spectral absorbance data of corn, diesel fuel, and ethylene. Here, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models reflecting the oil content of corn, the boiling point of diesel fuel, and the ethylene concentration are established after conducting wavelength selection using the MC-UVE algorithm, and corresponding multiple linear regression (MLR) models are established after conducting wavelength selection using the MC-UVE-SPA and MC-UVE-SPA-MW algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the progressive elimination of uncorrelated and collinear variables generates increasingly simplified partial-spectrum models with greater prediction accuracy than the full-spectrum model. Among the three wavelength selection algorithms, the MC-UVE-SPA selected the least number of wavelength variables, while the proposed MC-UVE-SPA-MW algorithm provided models with the greatest prediction accuracy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The design and the manufacture of the oil and gas pipelines are being improved over the years in response to the observed damages and related disastrous effects. The improvements are possible, thanks to the increasing knowledge about pipeline performances in specific contexts. The seismic hazard on buried pipelines has always been of major concern, and the earthquake-induced soil liquefaction effects are among the most important issues to be accounted for in the design. Experiences based on case histories, experimental modelling, and numerical simulations represent the source of understanding of the involved mechanisms, the affecting parameters, and the structure response. Recently, all these aspects are becoming more accurate, thanks to the use of monitoring systems. The protection of pipelines from the seismic hazard is a crucial and challenging issue. This paper provides an overview of the research that has been conducted over the years in the specific framework of soil liquefaction phenomenon. Case histories on pipeline performances, commonly adopted analytical methods, and results of model tests and numerical simulations are summarized with main focus on the level of knowledge achieved up to date and the existing limitations that represent open issues for further development of the research. This study represents a useful background to be adopted from academics and practitioners in order to enhance the methods of analyses of the pipelines, thus improving their performances in the applications of the oil and gas industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Doxorubicin- (DOX-) induced cardiomyocyte loss results in irreversible heart failure, which limits the clinical applications of DOX. Currently, there are no drugs that can effectively treat DOX-related cardiotoxicity. Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) has been reported to be a transforming growth factor-beta-inducible gene, and FSTL1 supplementation attenuated ischemic injury and cardiac apoptotic loss in mice. However, the effect of FSTL1 on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy has not been elucidated. We aimed to explore whether FSTL1 could prevent DOX-related cardiotoxicity in mice. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of DOX to induce acute cardiotoxicity. We used an adeno-associated virus system to overexpress FSTL1 in the heart. DOX administration decreased FSTL1 mRNA and protein expression in the heart and in cells. FSTL1 prevented DOX-related cardiac injury and inhibited cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis, thereby improving cardiac function in mice. FSTL1 also improved cardiomyocyte contractile functions in vitro. FSTL1 upregulated expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in DOX-treated hearts. FSTL1 was not capable of protecting against these toxic effects in Nrf2-deficient mice. In conclusion, FSTL1 protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via upregulation of Nrf2 expression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Neurodegenerative disease is an umbrella term for different conditions which primarily affect the neurons in the human brain. In the last century, significant research has been focused on mechanisms and risk factors relevant to the multifaceted etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, neurodegenerative diseases are incurable, and the treatments available only control the symptoms or delay the progression of the disease. This review is aimed at characterizing the complex network of molecular mechanisms underpinning acute and chronic neurodegeneration, focusing on the disturbance in redox homeostasis, as a common mechanism behind five pivotal risk factors: aging, oxidative stress, inflammation, glycation, and vascular injury. Considering the complex multifactorial nature of neurodegenerative diseases, a preventive strategy able to simultaneously target multiple risk factors and disease mechanisms at an early stage is most likely to be effective to slow/halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mercury pollution in the atmospheric environment is a matter of international concern. Mercury in coal-fired flue gas is the first human mercury emission source and has become the focus of national mercury pollution control. The catalytic performance of zerovalent mercury (Hg0) in coal-fired flue gas was studied by using manganese-cerium-aluminum oxide as catalyst. The effects of metal loading ratio, reaction temperature, calcination temperature, and O2 and SO2 concentration on the efficiency of Hg0 catalytic removal were investigated, and the Mn-Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalysts before and after the reaction were characterized by BET, SEM, XRD, and XPS to analyze the physicochemical properties of the samples. The results show that the mercury removal efficiency of the composite catalyst with Mn, Ce, and Al as the active component is higher than that of the single metal catalyst. The catalytic activity of Mn0.1Ce0.02Al is the best, the optimum reaction temperature is 150°C, the optimum calcination temperature is 400°C, and the O2 concentration in the conventional flue gas condition satisfies the effective oxidation of Hg0; SO2 in the flue gas can seriously inhibit the oxidation of Hg0.</dc:description>

<dc:description>DNA origami is the application of self-assembly in nanotechnology. The combination of DNA origami and hybridization chain reaction is one of the important application methods of DNA origami. In this paper, DNA origami is used to design the cipher pattern on the base of origami. The cipher chain, which is put into the reaction solution, hybridizes with the molecular beacon and the hairpin structure that form the cipher pattern to build a DNA origami model that can decode the pattern. The cipher chain consists of the starting chain and the intermediate chain. When the cipher is correct, the cipher chain can open the molecular beacon and the hairpin structure to display the cipher pattern on the origami base in the solution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aqueous extract of scraped coconut kernel is known as coconut milk. Coconut milk preparations are also commercially available in the form of desiccated powders or liquids. While these various coconut milk preparations are heavily used in cooking in the Asian countries as a major source of dietary fat, limited studies have been conducted on their chemical and nutritional composition. In this study, we have determined the chemical composition and nutritional effects of both domestic preparations of coconut milk and the commercially available counterparts. The results indicate that the phenolic compounds of all coconut milk preparations provide protection against oxidative damage on lipids and inhibit oxidative damage of both proteins and DNA. The lipid profiles are not significantly affected by the consumption of the three coconut milk preparations despite their different fat contents.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The fungal contamination and total aflatoxins (AF) and ochratoxin A (OTA) of tea samples were examined. A total of 60 tea samples were extracted and treated with immunoaffinity columns. The amount of AF and OTA were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector (FD). Tea samples were cultured and the fungi were identified. The results showed that 24 (40%) samples were contaminated with AFs and none of the tea samples were above the acceptable limit of AFs (≥10 μg/kg). All of the samples were contaminated with OTA where only 3 black tea samples (6.6%) and 1 green tea sample (6.7%) were detected to have more than the standard limits of toxin (10 μg·kg−1). The mean concentration of OTA in the black tea was higher than green tea. Aspergillus niger was the predominant fungi isolated from black and green tea samples. Considering the high contamination of mycotoxins in tea samples, regular monitoring in the tea process for improving quality is recommended.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The cross-sea bridges play an important role to promote the development of regional economy. These bridges located in earthquake-prone areas may be subjected to severe earthquakes during their lifetime. Group pile foundations have been widely used in cross-sea bridges due to their structural efficiency, ease of construction, and low cost. This paper investigates the seismic performance of bridge pile foundation based on the seismic fragility analysis. Based on the analysis platform OpenSees, the three-dimensional finite model of the bridge pile foundation is developed, where the pile-water interaction is replaced by the added mass method, nonlinear p-y, t-z, and q-z elements are used to simulate pile-soil interaction, and the displacement of the surface ground motion due to seismic excitations is applied on all spring supports. The seismic fragility curves of the bridge pile foundation are generated by using the earthquake records recommended by FEMA P695 as input motions. The curvature ductility based fragility curves are obtained using seismic responses for different peak ground accelerations. The effects of pile-water interaction, soil conditions, and different types of ground motions on the bridge pier fragilities are studied and discussed. Seismic fragility of the pier-group pile system shows that Sec C (the bottom section of the pier) is the most vulnerable section in the example fluid-structure-soil interaction (FSSI) system for all four damage LSs. The seismic responses of Sec E (a pile section located at the interface of the soil layer and water layer) are much lower than other sections. The parameter analysis shows that pile-water interaction has slight influence (less than 5%) on the fragility curves of the bridge pier. For the bridge group pile foundations considering the fluid-pile-soil interaction, PNF may induce larger seismic response than far-field (FF) and no-pulse near field (NNF). The bridge pile foundation in stiff soil is most vulnerable to seismic damage than soft condition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the advancement of China's interest rate marketization reform, commercial banks' net interest margin has narrowed. This paper selects 16 representative listed banks as the research object and conducts an empirical analysis from the two dimensions: profit level and profit structure. The study finds that the marketization of interest rates promoted the narrowing of net interest margins caused by the narrowing of net interest margins, and the profitability of commercial banks was suppressed. The narrowing of net interest spreads forced commercial banks to actively expand their intermediate business activities and adjust business structure correspondingly. The narrowing of net interest spreads has different impacts on the profitability of commercial banks of different sizes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Energy conservation is critical in the design of wireless sensor networks since it determines its lifetime. Reducing the frequency of transmission is one way of reducing the cost, but it must not tamper with the reliability of the data received at the sink. In this paper, duty cycling and data-driven approaches have been used together to influence the prediction approach used in reducing data transmission. While duty cycling ensures nodes that are inactive for longer periods to save energy, the data-driven approach ensures features of the data that are used in predicting the data that the network needs during such inactive periods. Using the grey series model, a modified rolling GM(1,1) is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Simulations suggest a 150% energy savings while not compromising on the reliability of the data received.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The last few years have seen the great potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to efficiently and effectively deal with an incredible deluge of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. If all the massive data is transferred to the cloud for intelligent processing, it not only brings considerable challenges to the network bandwidth but also cannot meet the needs of AI applications that require fast and real-time response. Therefore, to achieve this requirement, mobile or multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is receiving a substantial amount of interest, and its importance is gradually becoming more prominent. However, with the emerging of edge intelligence, AI also suffers from several tremendous security threats in AI model training, AI model inference, and private data. This paper provides three novel defense strategies to tackle malicious attacks in three aspects. First of all, we introduce a cloud-edge collaborative antiattack scheme to realize a reliable incremental updating of AI by ensuring the data security generated in the training phase. Furthermore, we propose an edge-enhanced defense strategy based on adaptive traceability and punishment mechanism to effectively and radically solve the security problem in the inference stage of the AI model. Finally, we establish a system model based on chaotic encryption with the three-layer architecture of MEC to effectively guarantee the security and privacy of the data during the construction of AI models. The experimental results of these three countermeasures verify the correctness of the conclusion and the feasibility of the methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this article, approaches to estimate the number of periodic solutions of ordinary differential equation are considered. Conditions that allow determination of periodic solutions are discussed. We investigated focal values for first-order differential nonautonomous equation by using the method of bifurcation analysis of periodic solutions from a fine focus Z=0. Keeping in focus the second part of Hilbert’s sixteenth problem particularly, we are interested in detecting the maximum number of periodic solution into which a given solution can bifurcate under perturbation of the coefficients. For some classes like C7,7,C8,5,C8,6,C8,7, eight periodic multiplicities have been observed. The new formulas ξ10 and ϰ10 are constructed. We used our new formulas to find the maximum multiplicity for class C9,2. We have succeeded to determine the maximum multiplicity ten for class C9,2 which is the highest known multiplicity among the available literature to date. Another challenge is to check the applicability of the methods discussed which is achieved by presenting some examples. Overall, the results discussed are new, authentic, and novel in its domain of research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effects of laser scanning speed on the microstructure, microhardness, and corrosion behavior of Ni45 coatings were investigated by using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), microhardness, and electrochemical measurements. The results showed that increasing laser scanning speed promotes the transformation from planar crystals to dendrites and refines the grains concurrently. The γ-(Ni, Fe), FeNi3, and M23(C,B)6 are identified as the primary phase composition in the Ni45 coatings regardless of the laser scanning speed. Thereinto, the formation and growth of M23(C,B)6 precipitates can be inhibited with increasing laser scanning speed due to the higher cooling rate, which affects the microhardness distribution and corrosion resistance of the coating. On the one hand, the microhardness of the whole coating presents a downtrend with increasing laser scanning speed due to the reduction of M23(C,B)6 phase. On the other hand, the corrosion resistance in 0.5 M NaCl solution is improved to some extent at higher laser scanning speed because the less precipitation of M23(C,B)6 reduces the depletion of Cr around the precipitates. In contrast, all the coatings exhibit undifferentiated but poor corrosion resistance in the highly corrosive 0.5 M NaCl + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare and often misdiagnosed vascular pathology. In this paper, we discuss a 51-year-old female with MALS presenting with hypotension due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment approach for such patients. This case report demonstrates the utility of conventional mesenteric angiography, cone beam CT with 3D reconstruction, and selective mesenteric transarterial embolization as an effective treatment approach for patients with spontaneous aneurysm rupture in MALS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The prevalence of nosocomial infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Folk medicine and ethnopharmacological data can provide a broad range of plants with promising antimicrobial activity. Triphala, an Ayurvedic formula composed of three different plants: Terminalia chebula Retz., Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. (Combretaceae), and Phyllanthus emblica L. (Phyllanthaceae), is used widely for various microbial infections. Various extraction techniques were applied in the extraction of the biologically active constituents of Triphala in order to compare their efficiency. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was shown to be the most efficient method based on yield, extraction time, and selectivity. The Triphala hydroalcoholic extract (TAE) has been chemically characterized with spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Triphala hydroalcoholic extract was evaluated alone or with carvacrol. Different drug formulations including cream and nanoemulsion hydrogel were prepared to assess the antimicrobial activity against selected microorganism strains including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. We used a lipophilic oil of carvacrol (5 mg/mL) and a hydrophilic TAE (5 mg/mL) ingredient in a dosage form. Two solutions were created: hydrogel containing nanoemulsion as a lipophilic vector dispersed in the gel as a hydrophilic vehicle and a cream formulation, an oil-in-water emulsion. In both cases, the concentration was 250 mg of active ingredient in 50 mL of final formulation. The formulas developed were stable from a physical and chemical perspective. In the nanoemulsion hydrogel, the oil droplet size ranged from 124 to 129 nm, with low polydispersity index (PdI) 0.132 ± 0.013 and negative zeta potential −46.4 ± 4.3 mV. For the cream, the consistency factor (cetyl alcohol and white wax) induced immobilization of the matrix structure and the stability. Triphala hydroalcoholic extract in drug nanoformulation illustrated might be an adjuvant antimicrobial agent for treating various microbial infections.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hydraulic fracturing techniques for developing deeply buried coal reservoirs face routine problems related to high initial pressures and limited control over the fracture propagation direction. A novel method of directional hydraulic fracturing (DHF) based on hydraulic slotting in a nonuniform pore pressure field is proposed. A mechanical model is used to address crack initiation and propagation in a nonuniform pore pressure field, where cracks tend to rupture and propagate towards zones of high pore pressure for reducing the effective rock stress more. The crack initiation pressure and propagation morphology are analyzed by rock failure process analysis software. The numerical results show that the directional propagation of hydraulic fracturing cracks is possible when the horizontal stress difference coefficient is less than or equal to 0.5 or the slotting deviation angle is less than or equal to 30°. These findings are in good agreement with experimental results, which support the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method and theory.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Haibin Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Junbo Long</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a high resolution time frequency representation technology for nonstationary signal analysis. The short time Fourier transform-based synchrosqueezing transform (FSST) and the S transform-based synchrosqueezing transform (SSST) time frequency methods are effective tools for bearing fault signal analysis. The fault signals belong to a non-Gaussian and nonstationary alpha (α) stable distribution with 1&lt;α&lt;2 and even the noises being also α stable distribution. The conventional FSST and SSST methods degenerate and even fail under α stable distribution noisy environment. Motivated by the fact that fractional low order STFT and fractional low order S-transform work better than the traditional STFT and S-transform methods under α stable distribution noise environment, we propose in this paper the fractional lower order FSST (FLOFSST) and the fractional lower order SSST (FLOSSST). In addition, we derive the corresponding inverse FLOSST and inverse FLOSSST. The simulation results show that both FLOFSST and FLOSSST perform better than the conventional FSSST and SSST under α stable distribution noise in instantaneous frequency estimation and signal reconstruction. Finally, FLOFSST and FLOSSST are applied to analyze the time frequency distribution of the outer race fault signal. Our results show that FLOFSST and FLOSSST extract the fault features well under symmetric stable (SαS) distribution noise.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Shengmai injection (SMI) contains Ginsen Radix et Rhizoma Rubra, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus. It is used as a supportive herbal medicine in the management of sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and septic or hemorrhagic shock. An UPLC method was established to identify and evaluate SMI fingerprints. Fingerprint similarities of 9 batches of SMI were compared. The network platform, “TCM-components-core targets-key pathways,” was established, and the mechanism of SMI in the treatment of sepsis was investigated. The similarity of 9 batches of SMI fingerprints was greater than 0.91. 44 peaks were selected as the common peaks, of which 11 peaks were identified. KEGG functional pathway analysis showed SMI was mainly involved in the pathways of cancer, cell cycle, and p53 signaling, suggesting SMI protects multiple organs via regulating immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, and energy metabolism. GO enrichment analysis showed active SMI components regulated various biological processes and altered the pathophysiology of sepsis. The interplays between SMI and multiple energy metabolism signaling cascades confer protection from life-threatening multiple organ failure in sepsis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An intelligent proportional-derivative sliding mode controller (i-PDSMC) is presented to overcome the unmodeled complexity of the robot manipulator under an actuator. i-PDSMC is a free model intelligent control based on the ultralocal, sliding mode, and PD control structure. A stability condition is determined by the Lyapunov theory. A comparative study between a classical PD, an intelligent PD control, and i-PDSMC is done through a robot manipulator under actuators. The simulation results prove that the proposed controller is more robust to trajectory tracking under parameter variations and external disturbances.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the present study, the replicative lifespan assay of yeast was used to guide the isolation of antiaging substance from Gentiana rigescens Franch, a traditional Chinese medicine. A compound with antiaging effect was isolated, and the chemical structure of this molecule as amarogentin was identified by spectral analysis and compared with the reported data. It significantly extended the replicative lifespan of K6001 yeast at doses of 1, 3, and 10 μM. Furthermore, amarogentin improved the survival rate of yeast under oxidative stress by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and these enzymes’ gene expression. In addition, this compound did not extend the replicative lifespan of sod1, sod2, uth1, and skn7 mutants with K6001 background. These results suggested that amarogentin exhibited antiaging effect on yeast via increase of SOD2, CAT, GPx gene expression, enzyme activity, and antioxidative stress. Moreover, we evaluated antioxidant activity of this natural products using PC12 cell system, a useful model for studying the nervous system at the cellular level. Amarogentin significantly improved the survival rate of PC12 cells under H2O2-induced oxidative stress and increased the activities of SOD and SOD2, and gene expression of SOD2, CAT, GPx, Nrf2, and Bcl-x1. Meanwhile, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) of PC12 cells were significantly reduced after treatment of the amarogentin. These results indicated that antioxidative stress play an important role for antiaging and neuroprotection of amarogentin. Interestingly, amarogentin exhibited neuritogenic activity in PC12 cells. Therefore, the natural products, amarogentin from G. rigescens with antioxidant activity could be a good candidate molecule to develop drug for treating neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gentiopicroside (GPS), an antiaging secoiridoid glycoside, was isolated from Gentiana rigescens Franch, a traditional Chinese medicine. It prolonged the replicative and chronological lifespans of yeast. Autophagy, especially mitophagy, and antioxidative stress were examined to clarify the mechanism of action of this compound. The free green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal from the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 and the colocation signal of MitoTracker Red CMXRos and GFP were increased upon the treatment of GPS. The free GFP in the cytoplasm and free GFP and ubiquitin of mitochondria were significantly increased at the protein levels in the GPS-treated group. GPS increased the expression of an essential autophagy gene, ATG32 gene, but failed to extend the replicative and chronological lifespans of ATG32 yeast mutants. GPS increased the survival rate of yeast under oxidative stress condition; enhanced the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase; and decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. The replicative lifespans of Δsod1, Δsod2, Δuth1, and Δskn7 were not affected by GPS. These results indicated that autophagy, especially mitophagy, and antioxidative stress are involved in the antiaging effect of GPS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Alopecia areata (AA) and vitiligo are both common skin diseases of autoimmune origin. Both alopecia areata and vitiligo have shown to be affected by oxidative stress. The present work is aimed at evaluating and comparing the serum proinflammatory cytokine levels in AA and nonsegmental vitiligo (NSV). A cross-sectional study was conducted of 33 patients with AA, 30 patients with NSV, and 30 healthy controls. Serum levels of interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin- (IL-) 1β, and IL-6 were determined quantitatively by ELISA method. Our analysis identified a signature of oxidative stress associated with AA and NSV, characterized by elevated levels of IFN-γ (AA: p=0.007283; NSV: p=0.038467), IL-1β (AA; NSV: p≤0.001), and IL-6 (AA; NSV: p≤0.001). IL-6 was also significantly increased in NSV patients in comparison with AA patients (p=0.004485). Our results supported the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play a significant role in promoting and amplifying the inflammatory process both in AA and vitiligo. The complex understanding of both disease etiopathogenesis involves interrelationships between oxidative stress and autoimmunity. The clinical study registration number is RNN/266/16/KE.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Software-Defined Network (SDN) can improve the performance of the power communication network and better meet the control demand of the Smart Grid for its centralized management. Unfortunately, the SDN controller is vulnerable to many potential network attacks. The accurate detection of abnormal flow is especially important for the security and reliability of the Smart Grid. Prior works were designed based on traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes. They are simple and shallow feature learning, with low accuracy for large and high-dimensional network flow. Recently, there have been several related works designed based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and they show excellent ability on network flow analysis. However, these methods cannot get the deep features from network flow, resulting in low accuracy. To address the above problems, we propose a Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (HYBRID-CNN) method. Specifically, the HYBRID-CNN utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to effectively memorize global features by one-dimensional (1D) data and utilizes a CNN to generalize local features by two-dimensional (2D) data. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by experiments on the datasets of UNSW_NB15 and KDDCup 99. The experimental results show that the HYBRID-CNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and False Positive Rate (FPR), which successfully demonstrates that it can effectively detect abnormal flow in the SDN-based Smart Grid.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Laryngeal secondary malignancies are rare, and most spread locoregionally from hypopharyngeal or thyroid primaries. Metastasis of ovarian carcinoma to the larynx is extremely rare. A 65-year-old woman with a history of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma was undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy for recurrence. She presented with progressive dysphagia and hoarseness; a computer tomography (CT) scan demonstrated bilateral necrotic lymphadenopathy and hypopharyngeal fullness. A hypopharyngeal mass was confirmed on examination, and operative biopsy identified it as high-grade serous ovarian. To our knowledge, this report describes the second immunohistochemically proven metastatic ovarian cancer detected in the larynx in the world literature.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zeqing Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, the security analysis of a bit-level image chaotic encryption algorithm based on the 1D chaotic map is proposed. The original image chaotic encryption algorithm includes bit-level permutation encryption, diffusion encryption, and linear transform. Deciphering of it can be divided into two stages. First, bit-level permutation encryption, diffusion encryption, and linear transform can be simplified into bit-level equivalent permutation encryption and equivalent diffusion encryption, which is a key breakthrough point of cryptanalysis. Second, the chaotic sequence generated by this algorithm is independent of the plaintext image. Therefore, the equivalent diffusion key and the equivalent permutation key can be obtained by chosen-plaintext attack, respectively. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation experiment results verify the effectiveness of the analytical method. Finally, some suggestions are proposed to promote the security of the original image chaotic encryption algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study used numerical analysis to carry out a large number of numerical model calculations based on a new semicircular bend (SCB) model. Instead of existing numerical computation methods (J-integral), the M-integral method was used to calculate the mixed mode fracture parameters (KI, KII, and KIII), investigate the influence of the geometry and material parameters on the fracture behavior under mixed mode I/III loading, and predict the fracture path. The results revealed that the limitations in the scope of the mixity parameter Me in the previous studies can be overcome to a certain extent. The range of Me was established under different Poisson ratios and can be used as a reference for actual material testing. The simulation path is in good agreement with the experimentally obtained fracture path, and the proposed method can be used to simulate the fracture path under mixed mode I/III loading.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jiaxin Gao</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Flight safety is of vital importance for tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can take off and land vertically as well as cruise at high speed, especially in different kinds of complex environment. As being the executor of the flight control, the actuator failure will directly affect the controllability of the tilt-rotor UAV, and it has high probability of causing fatal personal injury and financial loss. However, due to the limitation of weight and cost, small UAVs cannot be equipped with redundant actuators. Therefore, there is an urgent need of fault detection and diagnosis method for the actuators. In this paper, an actuator fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) is proposed. The actuator deflections are added to the state vector and estimated using EKF. The fault diagnosis algorithm of MMAE could assign a conditional probability to each faulty actuator according to the residual of EKF and diagnose the fault. This paper is structured as follows: first, the structure and model of tilt-rotor UAV actuator are established. Then, EKF observers are introduced to estimate the state vector and to calculate residual sequences caused by different faulty actuators. The residuals from EKFs are used by fault diagnosis algorithm to assign a conditional probability to each failure condition, and fault type can be diagnosed according to the probabilities. The FDD method is verified by simulations, and the results demonstrate that the FDD algorithm could accurately and efficiently diagnose actuator fault without any additional sensor.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shichen Gao</dc:creator>

<dc:description>When fluid flows through a pipe that is packed with sand particles, the fluid will bear the resistance from the sand-pack, as well as the viscous shear from the pipe wall. If the viscous shear from the pipe wall can be neglected, the fluid flow will obey Darcy’s law, and one can think the equivalent permeability of the packed-pipe equals the permeability of the sand-pack. However, if the viscous shear from the pipe wall cannot be neglected, the fluid flow will obey the Brinkman equation, and the permeability of the packed-pipe will be less than that of the sand-pack due to the additional viscous drag. In this work, on the basis of the Brinkman equation, we derived a series of analytical solutions for characterizing the fluid flow in packed-pipes. These solutions can be used to depict the velocity profiles, estimate the flux rate, and calculate the equivalent permeability of a packed-pipe. On the basis of these analytical solutions, we found that Poiseuille’s law is a special form of the derived equivalent permeability solution. We further divided the fluid flow in a packed-pipe into three regimes, including N-S flow, Brinkman flow, and Darcy flow. During the regime of Brinkman flow, the dimensionless flow velocity at the pipe center is 1, and the dimensionless flow velocity is gradually decreased to 0 at the pipe wall. We also investigated the effects of sorting, sand particle size, and sand-pack porosity on the packed-pipe permeability. The calculated results show that a more uniform size of the sand particles or a smaller mean particle diameter can lead to lower packed-pipe permeability. Compared to the sorting and mean particle diameter, the sand-pack porosity exerts a more significant effect on the packed-pipe permeability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Anomaly event detection has been extensively researched in computer vision in recent years. Most conventional anomaly event detection methods can only leverage the single-modal cues and not deal with the complementary information underlying other modalities in videos. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel two-stream convolutional networks model for anomaly detection in surveillance videos. Specifically, the proposed model consists of RGB and Flow two-stream networks, in which the final anomaly event detection score is the fusion of those of two networks. Furthermore, we consider two fusion situations, including the fusion of two streams with the same or different number of layers respectively. The design insight is to leverage the information underlying each stream and the complementary cues of RGB and Flow two-stream sufficiently. Two datasets (UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech) are used to validate the effectiveness of proposed solution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) fruits are rich in antioxidative phenolic compounds, which exert various health improving effects. This study aimed to comparatively study the protective effects of different phenolic fractions from the fruits treated with or without ultrahigh pressure (UHP) and their most abundant phenolic substance, caffeic acid, against the palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity in HepG2 cells and to clarify the potential mechanisms. Results showed that the TG accumulation, intracellular reactive oxygen species content, cell apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization were relieved by the administration of those phenolic fractions and caffeic acid. The protection of insoluble-bound (IB) phenolic fraction was the best, and UHP treatment significantly enhanced its protective effect on lipotoxicity. The lipotoxicity preventive effect may be achieved by alleviating intracellular oxidative stress, downregulating the expression of P-P38, COX-2, and iNOS to relieve inflammation, and downregulating Bax and cytochrome C and upregulating Bcl-2 to suppress the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the oil palm fruits phenolic fractions, especially the IB phenolic fraction, might be utilized as dietary antioxidants to relieve the adverse effects of a high-fat diet on the body, and UHP treatment is a potential method to increase this bioactivity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Naringin is a dihydroflavonoid, which is rich in several plant species used for herbal medicine. It has a wide range of biological activities, including antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, antiphotoaging, and antioxidative activities. So it would be interesting to know if naringin has an effect on aging and aging-related diseases. We examined the effect of naringin on the aging of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our results showed that naringin could extend the lifespan of C. elegans. Moreover, naringin could also increase the thermal and oxidative stress tolerance, reduce the accumulation of lipofuscin, and delay the progress of aging-related diseases in C. elegans models of AD and PD. Naringin could not significantly extend the lifespan of long-lived mutants from genes in insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and nutrient-sensing pathways, such as daf-2, akt-2, akt-1, eat-2, sir-2.1, and rsks-1. Naringin treatment prolonged the lifespan of long-lived glp-1 mutants, which have decreased reproductive stem cells. Naringin could not extend the lifespan of a null mutant of the fox-head transcription factor DAF-16. Moreover, naringin could increase the mRNA expression of genes regulated by daf-16 and itself. In conclusion, we show that a natural product naringin could extend the lifespan of C. elegans and delay the progression of aging-related diseases in C. elegans models via DAF-16.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accurate segmentation ofs organs-at-risk (OARs) in computed tomography (CT) is the key to planning treatment in radiation therapy (RT). Manually delineating OARs over hundreds of images of a typical CT scan can be time-consuming and error-prone. Deep convolutional neural networks with specific structures like U-Net have been proven effective for medical image segmentation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for multiorgan segmentation with higher accuracy and lower complexity. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed accuracy-complexity adjustment module (ACAM) can increase segmentation accuracy and reduce the model complexity and memory usage simultaneously. An attention-based multiscale aggregation module (MAM) is also proposed for further improvement. Experiment results on chest CT datasets show that the proposed network achieves competitive Dice similarity coefficient results with fewer float-point operations (FLOPs) for multiple organs, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ying Han</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the rapid progress of digital technology and new business models’ development, the platform ecosystem has not only penetrated every sector in society but also revealed various problems. Platform governance researchers have highlighted its significance, but failed to adequately consider ecosystem participants’ behaviour. This paper aims to explore platform governance’s effects on enterprises’ behaviour in a multiorganisational platform ecosystem context. The tripartite evolutionary game is chosen to construct a mathematical model that integrates the government, platform organisation, and internal enterprises to analyse formal and informal governance’s influence on enterprises’ behaviour in the platform ecosystem. It was discovered that both formal and informal governance can decrease internal enterprises’ opportunistic behaviours. Furthermore, formal governance has stronger effects than informal governance, although informal governance’s effects are more stable. Additionally, self-organisation in the platform ecosystem is another important area of focus. This paper enriches an understanding of platform ecosystems while formulating insights relevant in using platform governance to develop small and medium-sized enterprises.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Urachal remnant anomalies are uncommon in adults and can be confused with a variety of clinical conditions when symptomatic or infected. Vesicourachal diverticulum is the rarest type, accounting for approximately 3% to 5% of congenital urachal anomalies. We report the case of a 42-year-old female patient, who presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass. An infected vesicourachal diverticulum was diagnosed after imaging studies and was initially treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy and drainage of the urachal diverticulum to the urinary bladder through a JJ stent. Finally, the patient underwent open surgical excision of the urachal remnant. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of vesicourachal diverticulum. We recommend drainage of an infected vesicourachal diverticulum through the bladder by JJ stent placement inside its lumen during cystoscopy, as an alternative to percutaneous drainage reported in the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Individuals with disabilities are at higher risk for oral diseases such as caries and periodontal disease. Therefore, regular dental care is essential to maintain oral health. However, individuals with disabilities encounter difficulties in accessing dental care. The challenges and barriers to oral care faced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have not been addressed in Jordan. The aim of this study was to examine the use of dental services in individuals with ASD in Jordan and identify barriers that affect their access to dental care in comparison with individuals without ASD. A case-control study was carried out among 296 parents/caregivers of individuals with ASD and individuals without ASD, which involved completion of a self-designed questionnaire. The majority of the participants in both groups had visited the dentist in the year preceding completion of the questionnaire. The main reason for visiting dental services was toothache (43%), and the least common reason was routine checkup (11.6%), with a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) observed between the two groups. Barriers including embarrassment (43.5%), a lack of specialized dental staff (28.6%), a lack of knowledge of how to treat people with disabilities (26.6%), and inadequate facilities (34%) were significantly (P&lt;0.05) more likely to be reported by individuals with ASD than the controls. In conclusion, knowing and understanding the barriers to accessing dental care could improve overall health for individuals with ASD. Furthermore, recognizing the challenges in accessing dental care for this population could help oral health professionals to minimize these difficulties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Data mining and simulation of the Internet of things (IOT) have been applied more and more widely in the rapidly developing urban research discipline. Urban spatial structure is an important field that needs to be explored in the sustainable urban development, while data mining is relatively rare in the research of urban spatial structure. In this study, 705,747 POI (Point of Interest) were used to conduct simulation analysis of western cities in China by mining the data of online maps. Through kernel density analysis and spatial correlation index, the distribution and aggregation characteristics of different types of POI data in urban space were analyzed and the spatial analysis and correlation characteristics among different functional centers of the city were obtained. The spatial structure of the city is characterized by “multicenters and multigroups”, and the distribution of multicenters is also shown in cities with different functional types. The development degree of different urban centers varies significantly, but most of them are still in their infancy. Data mining of Internet of things (IOT) has good adaptability in city simulation and will play an important role in urban research in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Urban metro trains have the characteristics of short running distance between stations and frequent starting and braking. A large amount of regenerative braking energy is generated during the braking process. The effective utilization of the regenerative braking energy can substantially reduce the total energy consumption of train operation. In this paper, we establish two integer programming models of train operation that maximize the overlap time between train traction and braking in peak hours and nonpeak hours. On this basis, an improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is developed for solving the two integer programming models. The results demonstrate that the overlap time increases by 51.44% after optimization using the IDE algorithm when the headway is set to 154 s in peak hours. The overlap time is further increased by 14.87% by optimizing the headway. In nonpeak hours, the overlap time of traction and braking of the trains in opposite directions at the same station is increased by optimizing the bidirectional departure interval, thereby reducing the total energy consumption of the system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of open source community, the software ecosystem has become a popular perspective in the research on software development process and environment. Software productivity is an important evaluation indicator of the software ecosystem health. A successful software ecosystem relies on long-term and stable production activities by the users, which ensures that the software ecosystem can continuously provide the value needed by users. Therefore, the measurement of software ecosystem productivity can help maintain the user development efficiency and the stability of the software ecosystem. However, there is still little literature on the productivity of open source software ecosystems. By analogy with the natural ecosystem, this paper gives the relevant definitions of software ecosystem productivity and analyzes the factors affecting the productivity of software ecosystem. Based on the factors of the ecosystem productivity and their interrelationships, this paper establishes a software ecosystem productivity model and takes the GitHub platform as an example for detailed analysis and explanation. The results show that the model can better explain the factors affecting the productivity of software ecosystems. It is helpful for the research on the measurement of the software ecosystem health and the software development efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The search by SKB (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.) for a site to locate the deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel in Sweden has involved geoscientific investigations at several locations since the 1970s. The objectives were to characterise geologically a bedrock volume as well as its hydrogeology and hydrochemistry. To acquire high-quality hydrogeochemical data, a complete system for groundwater sampling and analysis, as well as for interpretation strategies, has been developed through a continuous process of modification and refinement. Since the largest part of the Swedish bedrock is composed of granitoids, the site investigations had to adapt to the special difficulties of fractured crystalline rocks. This paper discusses the problems with groundwater sampling that are specific to fractured crystalline rocks and describes the solutions adopted and methods developed by SKB since the early 2000s during the site investigations. The methodology described in this paper for the characterisation of deep groundwaters in crystalline rocks is not only applicable in the context of radioactive waste disposal but also useful when sampling groundwaters for any purpose in such rocks. Sampling of groundwaters in fractured rocks at depth, often down to approximately 1,000 m, involves special challenges since the natural conditions of the groundwater are easily disturbed, especially by the initial drilling, but also by every subsequent activity performed in the borehole, including the actual groundwater sampling. The sampling strategy presented in this paper shows that planning of the sampling preferably starts already when the drilling procedure is decided. Each following step is described in detail and includes tracing the drilling fluid, selecting the best borehole sections to sample, procedures for the actual sampling, and selection of analytical protocol; all this with the goal of taking representative samples. Although the evaluation of the sampling uncertainties is not a straightforward procedure, an adequate categorisation routine has been established to classify groundwater samples regarding sample quality, representativeness, and suitability for further interpretations and modelling.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yufeng Yao</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhiming Cui</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Epilepsy is a chronic disease caused by sudden abnormal discharge of brain neurons, causing transient brain dysfunction. The seizures of epilepsy have the characteristics of being sudden and repetitive, which has seriously endangered patients’ health, cognition, etc. In the current condition, EEG plays a vital role in the diagnosis, judgment, and qualitative location of epilepsy among the clinical diagnosis of various epileptic seizures and is an indispensable means of detection. The study of the EEG signals of patients with epilepsy can provide a strong basis and useful information for in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis. Although, intelligent classification technologies based on machine learning have been widely used to the classification of epilepsy EEG signals and show the effectiveness. In fact, it is difficult to ensure that there is always enough EEG data available for training the model in real life, which will affect the performance of the algorithms. In view of this, to reduce the impact of insufficient data on the detection performance of the algorithms, a novel discriminate least squares regression- (DLSR-) based inductive transfer learning method was introduced which is on the basis of DLSR and the inductive transfer learning. And, it is applied to promote the adaptability and accuracy of the epilepsy EEG signal recognition. The proposed method inherits the advantages of DLSR; it can be more suitable for classification scenarios by expanding the interval between different classes. Meanwhile, it can simultaneously use the data of the target domain and the knowledge of the source domain, which is helpful for getting better performance. The results show that the improved method has more advantages in EEG signal recognition comparing to several other representative methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Early core degradation determines the amount of hydrogen generated by cladding oxidation as well as the temperature, the mass, and the composition of corium that further relocates into the lower head of reactor pressure vessel (RPV), which is essential for the effectiveness analysis of in-vessel retention (IVR) and hydrogen recombiners. In this paper, the mechanisms of controlling phenomena in the early phase of core degradation are analysed at first. Then, numerical models adopted to calculate (1) core heating up, (2) cladding oxidation, (3) dissolution between molten zirconium and fuel pellets, and (4) formation of a molten pool in the core active section are presented. Compared with integral codes for severe accident analysis (such as MAAP and MELCOR), the models in this paper are established at the fuel pin level and the calculation is performed in 3D, which can capture the detail local phenomena during the core degradation and eliminate the average effect due to equivalent rings used in integral codes. In addition, most of the control equations in this paper are calculated by implicit schemes, which can improve the accuracy and stability of the calculation. In the simulation, the calculation oxidation is calculated by using the oxygen diffusion model, while the dissolution is calculated with Kim, Hayward, Hofmann, and IBRAE models to perform uncertainty analysis. For the validation, the cladding oxidation model is verified by Olander theoretical cases in the conditions of both steam-rich and steam-starved. The dissolution models are validated by the RIAR experiment. The code is overall verified by Phebus FPT0 on the integral phase of core early degradation. According to the simulation results, it can be inferred that the dissolution reaction between the molten zirconium and fuel pellets is the main reason for the melting of UO2 at low temperature. In the case of starved steam, part of the fuel pellets can melt down even at 2248 K and relocate to the bottom of the core, which is much lower than the melting point of UO2 (3113 K).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The growing need to store, share, and manage medical and health records has resulted in electronic medical health sharing system (mHealth), which provides intelligent medical treatment for people. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as a new cryptology to enhance fine-grained access control over encrypted sharing data in mHealth. However, some existing attribute-based mHealth systems not only violate the one-to-many application characteristics of attribute-based encryption mechanism but also destroy the anonymity of user. In this study, an efficient scheme is proposed to tackle the above defaults and offer two-way anonymity of data owner and data user by introducing a pseudoidentity. The computation of hidden access policy is reduced by removing the bilinear pairing, whereas the interaction between cloud storage and data user is avoided to save bandwidth during trapdoor generation. We also consider the temporal factor of the uploaded information by introducing access validity. Security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme is efficient without reducing security.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To investigate the expression patterns and prognostic values of STEAP family members in the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Materials and Methods. The Human Protein Atlas was used to analyze the expression level of STEAPs in human normal tissues and malignant tumors. ONCOMINE datasets were analyzed for the comparison of the STEAPs levels between malignant cancers and corresponding normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyze the prognostic value of STEAPs in breast cancer patients. Results. STEAPs were widely distributed in human normal tissues with diverse levels. Normally, it is predicted that STEAP1 and STEAP2 were involved in the mineral absorption process, while STEAP3 participated in the TP53 signaling pathway and iron apoptosis. The results from ONCOMINE showed downregulation of STEAP1, STEAP2, and STEAP4 in breast cancers. Survival analysis revealed that breast cancer patients with high levels of STEAP1, STEAP2, and STEAP4 had a good prognosis, while those with low expression had high overall mortality. Conclusion. STEAP1, STEAP2, and STEAP4 are predicted to be the potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer patients, providing novel therapeutic strategies for them.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Early detection and treatment are key to delaying the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), avoiding loss of vision, and reducing the burden of advanced disease. Our study is aimed at determining if total bilirubin has a predictive value for DR progression and exploring the potential mechanism involved in this pathogenesis. A total of 540 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) were enrolled between July 2014 and September 2016 and assigned into a progression group (N=67) or a stable group (N=473) based on the occurrence of diabetic macular edema (DME), vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or other conditions that may cause severe loss of vision following a telephonic interview in August 2019. After further communication, 108 patients consented to an outpatient consultation between September and November 2019. Our findings suggest the following: (1) TBIL were significant independent predictors of DR progression (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54–0.89, p=0.006). (2) Examination of outpatients indicated that compared to stable group patients, progression group patients had more components of urobilinogen and LPS but a lower concentration of TBIL. The relationship between bilirubin and severe DR was statistically significant after adjusting for sex, age, diabetes duration, type of diabetes, FPG, and HbA1c (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.912–0.986, p=0.016). The addition of serum LPS and/or urobilinogen attenuated this association. This study concludes that total bilirubin predicts an increased risk of severe DR progression. Decreasing bilirubin might be attributed to the increased levels of LPS and urobilinogen, which may indicate that the change of bilirubin levels is secondary to intestinal flora disorder and/or intestinal barrier destruction. Further prospective investigations are necessary to explore the causal associations for flora disorder, intestinal barrier destruction, and DR.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zihan Zhou</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhonghui Chen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Open-pit slopes contain numerous nonpenetrating, intermittent joints which maintain stability under blasting operations. The tip dynamic response coefficient (DRC) of parallel cracks in a typical rock mass under combined dynamic and static loading conditions was calculated in this study based on the superposition principle. The dynamic response law of the intermittent joint in the slope under blasting was determined accordingly. The influence of many factors (the disturbance amplitude of dynamic load, the lateral confining pressure, the length of rock bridge, the length between cracks, the staggered distance between cracks, and the crack inclination angle) on the dynamic response was theoretically analyzed as well. The ABAQUS numerical assessments were conducted on simulation models with parallel cracks under combined dynamic and static loading conditions. The results show that a larger dynamic load amplitude and smaller crack inclination angle/confining pressure result in greater Type II dynamic strengthening effect on the crack tip. When the length of the rock bridge between cracks (s) is smaller than the half length of the crack (a), the dynamic strengthening effect at the crack tip weakens gradually with increase in s; whens/a≥1, the strengthening effect is almost unchanged. With the increase in the staggered distance between cracks (h), the dynamic strengthening effect of the crack tip weakens at first and then strengthens; the strengthening effect is weakest when h/a=0.4; the crack propagation under combined dynamic and static loading is the most sensitive to the lateral confining pressure (σ3) and is the least sensitive to the inclination angle of the cracks (α). Theoretical results are validated by comparison with numerical simulation results. Such information regarding the dynamic response law of the parallel cracks in rock masses under dynamic and static loading conditions is conducive to further research on the mesofailure mechanism of open-pit mine jointed rock slopes under blasting operations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aerodynamic characteristics of road vehicles in windy environments are the prerequisites for the evaluation and prediction of the driving safety and stability. To investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of the overtaking vehicles on the bridge deck under the effects of crosswinds, models of a cable-stayed bridge with a typical flat box girder and road vehicles involving articulated lorry and commercial van with a scale of 1 : 40 were tested in the wind tunnel laboratory. A series of tests figured out the variation of the aerodynamic forces of road vehicles during the overtaking process after considering the aerodynamic interference between lorry and lorry, van and van, and lorry and van. Additionally, the influence of the lateral overtaking distance between the overtaking vehicles was regarded as well. The result reveals the upstream vehicle has a significant influence on the aerodynamic coefficients of the downstream vehicle, which have experienced dramatic fluctuations during the overtaking process, and the various shapes of the aerodynamic coefficients are highly dependent on it.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Few studies have investigated household interventions to enhance indoor air quality (IAQ) and health outcomes in relatively low-income communities. This study aims to examine the impact of the combined intervention with asthma education and air purifier on IAQ and health outcomes in the US-Mexico border area. An intervention study conducted in McAllen, Texas, between June and November 2019 included 16 households having children with asthma. The particulate matter (PM2.5) levels were monitored in the bedroom, kitchen, and living room to measure the IAQ for 7 days before and after the intervention, respectively. Multiple surveys were applied to evaluate changes in children's health outcomes. The mean PM2.5 levels in each place were significantly improved. Overall, they significantly decreased by 1.91 μg/m3 on average (p&lt;0.05). All surveys showed better health outcomes; particularly, quality of life for children was significantly improved (p&lt;0.05). This pilot study suggests that the combined household intervention might improve IAQ in households and health outcomes for children with asthma and reduce health disparities in low-income communities. Future large-scale studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of this household intervention to improve IAQ and asthma management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of different phenolic extracts from non- and ultra-high-pressure- (UHP-) treated palm fruits and their main phenolic compounds against pancreatic lipase and α-glucosidase and to further analyze the interaction and inhibitory mechanisms of two main phenolics (caffeic acid and catechin). Results showed that the free, esterified, and insoluble-bound phenolic fractions from the non- and UHP-treated fruits demonstrated good inhibitory effects towards two enzymes. The insoluble-bound phenolic fraction, regardless of UHP treatment, presented the strongest inhibitory capacities, and UHP treatment significantly upgraded the inhibitory effects of these phenolic fractions (lipase IC50 : 78.01 vs. 72.50 μg/mL; α-glucosidase IC50 : 76.42 vs. 64.51 μg/mL). Catechin and caffeic acid, main phenolic compounds detected in all phenolic fractions of the fruits, showed similar efficiencies on inhibiting the two enzymes, which were consistent with the findings observed by molecular docking analysis. Moreover, these two phenolic compounds exhibited a synergy effect on inhibiting pancreatic lipase and α-glucosidase at a relatively high combination concentration with the ratio of 1 : 1. Therefore, the present work may be helpful for further application of palm fruits as food supplements or nutraceuticals to control energy intake to improving some chronic metabolic diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nurses consist of an occupational group that is particularly exposed to harmful work-related factors such as prolonged working hours, severe stress, fatigue, and excessive strain on the musculoskeletal system. According to nurses, the limitation of the application of ergonomic principles of work may contribute to the occurrence of numerous dangerous behaviors, improper eating habits, or deficiency of systematic physical activity. The most common consequences are nutritional disorders and musculoskeletal system dysfunctions. This prospective observational study was aimed at evaluating selected parameters of the body composition of professionally active nurses and at determining work-related risks during nursing activities. The study group consisted of 37 active nurses (38.38±11.33 years). The research tool was a device for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). A questionnaire designed by the authors was also implemented, which covered ergonomic principles, musculoskeletal injuries, and nutritional habits. In the present study, it was shown that all average values of the tested nurses’ body composition parameters were within the normal range. The majority of respondents (97.3%) reached a high level of body water. A statistically significant correlation was found between the knowledge of the workplace ergonomic principles and body mass index. In conclusion, musculoskeletal pain and lack of implementation of ergonomic behaviors are a significant problem among nurses, which may be the cause of overweight or obesity in this occupational group.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper advances a new single-parameter chaotic system with a simple structure, and some basic dynamic behavior of the new single-parameter system is discussed, such as equilibria, dissipativity, the existence of an attractor, Lyapunov exponent, Poincaré map, spectrum map, and bifurcation diagram. Moreover, a new fixed-time convergence theorem is proposed for general chaotic systems based on finite-time control theory, and a fixed-time controller is also put to achieve synchronization of the new chaotic system. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. The conclusion of the paper is useful for the nonlinear economics and engineering application.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. This study was aimed to assess the patient’s knowledge and awareness about hypertension and adherence to antihypertensive medication among hypertensive patients. Methods. The descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in three medical clinics of Colombo South Teaching hospital, Kalubowila, Sri Lanka, from April 2019 to September 2019. Total of 384 hypertensive patients were recruited by systematic randomized controlled sampling and interviewed with validated questionnaires to assess their knowledge about hypertension and adherence to antihypertensive medication. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 21) analytical package, and the chi-squared test was performed. Results. The total sample consisted of 384 hypertensive patients with a mean age of 59.32 (±12.34SD). This included 180 (46.9%) males and 204 (53.1%) females. The male : female ratio was approximately 9 : 10. Most of patients were with primary and ordinary educational status (65.9%), normal body mass index (54.9%), mild elevation of LDL cholesterol (76.3%), and coexistent ischemic heart disease (39.6%). The knowledge about hypertension among majority of patients was reasonable. However, they were unaware about normal values of blood pressure (69%, 95% of CI 1.92–2.09) and diagnostic values of hypertension (90.1%, 95% of CI 2.26–2.40). Moreover, they were unaware of their blood pressure values at time of diagnosis (75.3%, 95% of CI 2.09–2.25), at recent clinic visit (71.3%, 95% of CI 2.0-2.17), and target level (81.8%, 95% of CI 2.25-2.41). Most patients had adequate knowledge about the risk factors and complications of hypertension and were aware of their target organ damage (70.3%). Most patients believed that medication alone is not sufficient to control blood pressure (41.7%, 95% of CI 1.40-1.51) and adequate control of their blood pressure reduces complications (68.2%, 95% of CI 1.37-1.51). Most of the patients (71.8%) had reasonable good drug compliance. The forgetfulness was commonly attributed for nonadherence (69%, 95% of CI 1.26-1.36). Conclusions. The knowledge about hypertension among majority of patients was reasonable. But, they were unaware about their disease status and their diagnosis, target, and recent blood pressure values. Most of patients had adequate knowledge about the risk factors and complications of hypertension. However, they were unaware about their target organ damage due to hypertension. The drug compliance was reasonable among them. The forgetfulness was common reason for nonadherence. Therefore, healthcare professionals should implement individualized educational programmes to increase the awareness of disease status, appropriate blood pressure levels, and adherence of treatment to improve the outcome of patients.</dc:description>

All patients had dysphonia at the moment of the diagnostic and in 35.5% of cases, and it was associated with laryngeal dyspnea. Glottis localization was present in all our patients, i.e., 100% of the cases. A tracheotomy was performed in 9.67% of cases. All of our patients have had their papilloma peeled per endoscopic with tweezers. No cases of malignant degeneration were found in our study. Conclusion. Laryngeal papillomatosis is the most common benign tumor of the larynx in both children and adults. Despite the progress of endoscopy and antiviral treatments, its treatment poses many problems in our undermedicalized countries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Appropriate effluent treatment processes are expected to significantly reduce the toxicity of effluents before they are released to the natural environment. The present study was aimed to assess the spatial and temporal variations of the physical and chemical water quality parameters of a natural water body receiving treated textile effluents and to assess the chromosomal abnormalities induced by the treated textile effluents. Four sampling sites (A: effluent discharge point; B: 100 m downstream from site A along the tributary; C: 200 m downstream from site A along the tributary; D: 100 m upstream from site A along the tributary) were selected associated to a tributary that received treated textile effluent. The physical and chemical water quality parameters were measured in the composite water samples collected from the study sites, and Allium cepa bioassay was conducted using aged tap water as the control. Sampling was conducted in both rainy and dry seasons. The conductivity, TDS, COD, and colour intensity of the water samples collected from the study sites were significantly higher during the dry season compared to those in the rainy season. Allium cepa root meristematic cells exposed to water samples from sites A, B, and C showed a significantly high interphase and prophase indices compared to those exposed to aged tap water and upstream site during both rainy and dry seasons. The mitotic index of the root tip cells of Allium cepa bulbs exposed to the water samples collected from the effluent discharge point (site A) and from the 100 m downstream site from site A (site B) was significantly lower than that of the other sites in both rainy and dry seasons. However, the mitotic index of the root tip cells of Allium cepa bulbs exposed to the water samples from the upstream site was not significantly different from that of the control treatment during both sampling seasons. The bioassay indicated that the mitotic index and phase index of the root meristematic cells of Allium cepa can be affected by the treated textile effluents released to the water body and the occurrence of C metaphase, chromosomal adherence, bridges, disturbed anaphase, vagrant chromosomes, and chromosomal breaks indicated that the treated textile effluent receiving tributary can possibly contain genotoxic and mutagenic compounds which can induce chromosomal abnormalities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the water resources allocation project in Pearl River Delta, in order to optimize the structural design, the deep buried tunnel adopts the composite lining structure. However, the weakest link in a complex structure is the connection between two different interfaces. This paper reports the findings of an experimental study that was undertaken to investigate the interface mechanical performance of steel self-compacting concrete composite structure subjected to cyclic loads. In this study, different shear connectors are considered, and six different specimens were designed and tested, respectively. The test is used to research the effect of the different shear connectors on the bearing capacity and interface mechanical properties of composite structure in an experimental study. According to these test results, a detailed analysis was carried out on the relationships, such as the stress-strain and load-displacement relationships for the specimen. These tests show that the shear connectors will significantly enhance the bearing capacity and interface mechanical properties of the composite structure. Among them, the comprehensive performance of the specimens using the stud-longitudinal ribs shear connectors is the best. Additionally, a finite element analysis (FEA) model was developed. The comparison of the simulation results with the experimental results shows that this FEA is applicable for this type of experiment.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Seechad Noonpradej</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Osaree Akaraborworn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background. Intravenous fluid therapy plays a role in maintaining the hemodynamic status for tissue perfusion and electrolyte hemostasis during surgery. Recent trials in critically ill patients reported serious side effects of some types of fluids. Since the most suitable type of fluid is debatable, a consensus in perioperative patients has not been reached. Method. We performed a systematic review of randomized control trials (RCTs) that compared two or more types of fluids in major abdominal surgery. The outcomes were related to bleeding, hemodynamic status, length of hospital stay, and complications, such as kidney injury, electrolyte abnormality, major cardiac adverse event, nausea, vomiting, and mortality. A literature search was performed using Medline and EMBASE up to December 2019. The data were pooled to investigate the effect of fluid on macrocirculation and intravascular volume effect. Results. Forty-three RCTs were included. Eighteen fluids were compared: nine were crystalloids and nine were colloids. The results were categorized into macrocirculation and intravascular volume effect, microcirculation, anti-inflammatory parameters, vascular permeability, renal function (colloids), renal function and electrolytes (crystalloids), coagulation and bleeding, return of bowel function, and postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV). We found that no specific type of fluid led to mortality and every type of colloid was equivalent in volume expansion and did not cause kidney injury. However, hydroxyethyl starch and dextran may lead to increased bleeding. Normal saline can cause kidney injury which can lead to renal replacement therapy, and dextrose fluid can decrease PONV. Conclusion. In our opinion, it is safe to give a balanced crystalloid as the maintenance fluid and give a colloid, such as HES130/0.4, 4% gelatin, or human albumin, as a volume expander.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Facial candling is a traditional method used for relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR). This study aims to investigate the knowledge and perception of facial candling in a sample of staff and students in a public university in Malaysia. Methods. An online questionnaire survey method was used. Based on sample size calculation, a total of 1,508 UiTM staff and students from ten selected campuses of Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) were invited to participate in this survey. An up-to-date e-mail list of staff in the selected campuses was used as the sampling frame for the study, whereas the students were recruited from the official university student Facebook portal. Results. A total of 788 respondents participated in this survey, 72.2% of them knew about facial candling, though only 35.4% had tried the treatment. Approximately one-fifth of respondents agreed that facial candling might treat AR. It was found that a higher number of users than nonusers agreed that facial candling was a traditional medicine (78.9% vs 55.0%); could be used on the face and ears (83.5% vs 45.4%); and could be self-administered at home (83.5 vs 45.4%). Interestingly, more than half of them were uncertain about its long-term effects and adverse reactions. Conclusion. This study confirms the facial candling use among patients with AR although the percentage is low. The patients and general public need to be better informed about the use of facial candling in AR and its associated risks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Our aim was to assess the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage associated with diabetes among patients taking low-dose aspirin (≤325 mg/day). Methods. A systematic search was conducted for publication in English and Chinese using term equivalents for “GI hemorrhage”, “aspirin”, and “diabetes mellitus” up till April 2020. Electronic databases include PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and VIP Database. Two independent authors searched databases and reviewed abstracts for comprehensive studies keeping adequate study quality. Data of weighted odds ratios were statistically evaluated and potential bias was checked. Results. Among 446 publications, eight case-control researches, including 1601 patients, were deemed for this meta-analysis. Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of GI hemorrhage than patients without diabetes: the summary ORs were 3.10 (95% CI, 2.35–4.09). The heterogeneity of the reports was not significant (Chi2=3.39, P=0.85; I2=0%). Conclusion. The meta-analysis showed that aspirin users with diabetes were more likely to have GI hemorrhage. Hence, when treating diabetics with aspirin, the increased risk of GI bleeding should be taken in consideration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Teff is a dominantly cultivated and stable crop in Ethiopia primarily grown for its grain which is used for preparing injera. In spite of its importance, the productivity is very low due to many factors among them, and poor agronomic practices are the major ones. In view of this, a field experiment, under rain-fed condition, was conducted at Laelay Machew district with the objective of evaluating the response of teff to seeding rate and methods of sowing during 2017/18 main cropping season. The experiment comprised four levels of seeding rate (10, 15, 20, and 25 kg/ha) and two methods of sowing (broad casting and row planting), and the experiment was laid in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement in randomized complete block design (RCBD), replicated three times. Data related to phenology, growth, yield, and yield attributes were collected and analyzed using SAS software. Results indicated that days to panicle emergence, plant height, total number of tillers, productive tillers, main panicle seed weight, thousand-seed weight, panicle length, and harvest index were significantly (P&lt;0.05) affected by the main effects of seeding rate and methods of sowing but these parameters showed no response to interaction effects of the two treatment factors. However, the interaction of the two treatment factors affected grain yield, biological yield, and straw yield. Plots sown with low seeding rate (10 kg/ha) combined with row planting gave high grain yield (2333 kg/ha), biological yield (7666 kg/ha), and straw yield (5333 kg/ha). Therefore, using treatment combinations of seeding rate of 10 kg·ha−1 together with the row method of sowing can be advised for teff production in the subhumid areas of central zone of Tigray.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The dental pulp is a heterogeneous soft tissue that supplies nutrients and acts as a biosensor to identify pathogenic stimuli. Regeneration of the dental pulp is one of the desirable topics for researchers. Graphene oxide nanosheets (nGOs) help overexpression of the genes related to odontogenic differentiation of stem cells from dental pulps and increases attachment and proliferation of dental pulp stem cells. Despite its benefits, nGO may be considered as a threat to the environment and human health. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility potential of graphene oxide (nGO), chitosan functionalized graphene oxide (nGO-CS), and carboxylated graphene (nGO-COOH) when exposed to human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). Material and Methods. Some different aspects of biocompatibility of nGO, nGO-CS, and nGO-COOH were synthesized, and several intracellular effects induced by different concentrations of graphene-based nanosheets, including cell viability, intracellular oxidative damages, and various factors such as LDH, GSH, SOD, MDA, and MMP, were studied on hDPSCs. Results. According to results, IC50 was determined as 232.01, 467.81, and ≥1000 μg/mL for nGO, nGO-CS, and nGO-COOH, respectively. These results demonstrated the lower toxicity and higher cytocompatibility of nGO-CS and nGO-COOH compared to nGO. nGO-COOH not only has any adverse effect on the cell membrane and mitochondrial activity but also shows slight antioxidant activity at some concentrations. Conclusion. The findings help design safe and cytocompatible nGO derivatives for biomedical applications in dental fields.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Empowerment is an organisational effort in increasing the willingness and ability of employees to be more independent in performing their duties. Employee leadership empowerment substantially increases motivation, performance, and commitment to the organisation. Leadership empowerment includes self-determination, competence, meaning, and impact. The purpose of this study was to determine the acceptance of leadership empowerment efforts for female employees in three dental hospitals in Bandung. Methods. A descriptive survey was conducted and the study population was dental hospitals in Bandung. The exclusion criteria were dental hospitals which unwillingly followed the research. The inclusion criteria were dental hospitals that have empowered female employees. The data collection technique was performed with total sampling. The research sample amounted to 102 people from three dental hospitals—all data were collected using a validated questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using relative frequency distribution. Results. Leadership empowerment for female employees in three dental hospitals in Bandung has been given by each. The highest acceptance of empowerment efforts for female employees was shown by employees of Dental Hospital of Jenderal Achmad Yani University, followed by Dental Hospital of Universitas Padjadjaran, and subsequently Dental Hospital of Maranatha Christian University. The level of acceptance of empowerment efforts that need to be improved in three Dental Hospitals in Bandung was self-determination or autonomy at work. Employees must be given more freedom on performing their duties, developing their careers, and acting more independently. Conclusion. Acceptance of leadership empowerment for female employees in three dental hospitals in Bandung has been demonstrated in each. Acceptance of leadership empowerment efforts in all subdimensions of empowerment needs to be improved, primarily related to self-determination.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. This study aimed to compare and analyze the effect of preoperative zoledronic acid (ZOL) administration on pain intensity after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). Methods. The study included 242 patients with OVCFs who underwent PVP in our hospital between January 2015 and June 2018. The patients were randomly assigned to either a ZOL group (n = 121) or a control group (n = 121). The patients in the ZOL group were treated preoperatively with intravenous infusion of 5 mg ZOL. Those in the control group were treated without ZOL. All the patients were followed up for 1 year. Results. No statistically significant differences in age, sex, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were found between the two groups. During the follow-up period, the visual analog scale score and Oswestry dysfunction index score in the ZOL group were lower than those in the control group. The bone mineral density at 6 or 12 months after treatment was significantly higher and the levels of the bone metabolism markers were significantly lower in the ZOL group than in the control group (P&lt;0.05 for both). Two patients in the treatment group had new vertebral fractures, whereas 13 patients in the control group had new vertebral fractures, which translate to recompression vertebral fracture incidence rates of 1.7% and 10.7%, respectively. The incidence rate of mild adverse reactions was significantly higher in the ZOL group than in the control group, but all the cases were endurable. Conclusion. Intravenous infusion of ZOL before PVP can effectively reduce postoperative pain intensity, reduce bone loss, increase bone density, reduce the risk of refracture, and improve patient quality of life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To retrospectively investigate the one-year clinical outcome following a standardized treatment protocol for immediate loading. The protocol mandates predefined requirements for implant stability. If fulfilled, immediate loading of the implants is performed with a simplified prosthetic protocol which includes one-time impression at the time of surgery and definitive restoration within eight weeks. Methods. Twenty-five patients were treated with 48 Neoss ProActive Tapered implants. Minimum primary stability was established before subjecting the implants to immediate nonfunctional load. Definitive prostheses were delivered six to eight weeks from implant placement. Insertion torque (IT), resonance frequency analysis (RFA), intraoral radiographs, and impressions of implant positions were registered at implant placement. During clinical follow-up, RFA was measured at two, four, and six to eight weeks and six months from implant placement to monitor continued implant stability. Marginal bone level measurements were performed at implant placement, six-month, and one-year follow-up visits. Results. IT was over 40 N·cm for 46 implants. Two implants with IT &lt;30 N·cm were both splinted to another implant with IT &gt;50 N·cm, tightening the retention screw with low forces. No implants were lost during the observation period. Mean RFA measurements remained stable without any decrease during the initial six-month healing phase. Mean marginal bone remodeling was −0.47 ± 0.38 mm from implant placement to 1 year. No significant difference was found for marginal bone remodeling between implants placed in the healed bone or fresh extraction sockets. Conclusion. Within the limits of this study, it is concluded that using a simplified immediate loading protocol can be predictably applied to reduce the overall treatment time and the number of clinical sessions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) develops rapidly, cloud computing and fog computing become effective measures to solve some problems, e.g., limited computing resources and increased network latency. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a key factor within the development of IIoT, whose security affects the whole IIoT. ICS involves many aspects, like water supply systems and electric utilities, which are closely related to people’s lives. ICS is connected to the Internet and exposed in the cyberspace instead of isolating with the outside recent years. The risk of being attacked increases as a result. In order to protect these assets, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have drawn much attention. As one kind of intrusion detection, anomaly detection provides the ability to detect unknown attacks compared with signature-based techniques, which are another kind of IDS. In this paper, an anomaly detection method with a composite autoencoder model learning the normal pattern is proposed. Unlike the common autoencoder neural network that predicts or reconstructs data separately, our model makes prediction and reconstruction on input data at the same time, which overcomes the shortcoming of using each one alone. With the error obtained by the model, a change ratio is put forward to locate the most suspicious devices that may be under attack. In the last part, we verify the performance of our method by conducting experiments on the SWaT dataset. The results show that the proposed method exhibits improved performance with 88.5% recall and 87.0% F1-score.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, hourly observations of precipitation, wind, and PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in Qinhuangdao from 2016 to 2018 were used to study the effects of precipitation and wind on PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. The results show that precipitation has a certain wet scavenging effect on PM2.5 and PM10, and the scavenging effect on PM10 is greater than that on PM2.5. Precipitation above moderate rainfall is concentrated from May to September, and light rain in winter increases the concentration of pollutants. The changes of PM2.5 before and after precipitation are related to the initial concentration of PM2.5 before precipitation, precipitation intensity, and precipitation duration. The scavenging effect of precipitation on PM10 is closely related to the initial concentration of PM10 before precipitation. The higher the initial concentration of PM10 is, the greater the removal amount of precipitation will be. Moderate or above pollution weather mainly occurs in the northeast, southwest, and west wind meteorological conditions; the more westerly the wind, the more the pollution; north wind and northwest wind have the most obvious scavenging effect on PM2.5 and Pm10; when the wind speed increases to 2 m/s, the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 can be reduced; when the wind speed is more than 4 m/s, the concentration of PM10 increases under the south wind, southeast wind, east wind, and northeast wind.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, mixed oxides of Mn-Cu and Fe-Cu on OMS-2 support having an octahedral structure were synthesized by the refluxing and impregnation methods. The characteristics of the materials were analyzed by XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and H2-TPR. In the CO oxidation test, CuFeOx/OMS-2 had slightly higher catalytic activity but is significantly more stable than CuMnOx/OMS-2 and CuO/OMS-2. Due to its lower reduction temperature in H2-TPR analysis, the Mars-Van-Krevelen mechanism for CuFeOx/OMS-2 (Cu2+–O–Fe3+ ↔ Cu+–□–Fe2+) could take place more energetically than CuO/OMS-2 and CuMnOx/OMS-2 (Cu2+–O2−–Mn4+ ↔ Cu+–□–Mn3+). In addition, the interaction between Fe and Cu in the catalyst could improve the durability of the surface oxides structure in comparison with that between Mn and Cu. With the high specific rate and TOF of 28.6 mmol/h.g and 0.508, respectively, CuFeOx/OMS-2 has a great potential as an effective catalyst for low-temperature oxidation application in CO and possible VOCs removal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The moisture absorption behavior of flax fiber-reinforced epoxy composites is deliberated to be a serious issue. This property restricts their usage as outdoor engineering structures. Therefore, this study provides an investigation of moisture in flax fibers on the performance of the flax/epoxy composite materials based on their shear responses. The ±45° aligned flax fibers exposed to different relative humidities (RH) and the vacuum infusion process was used to manufacture the composite specimens. The optimum shear strength (40.25 ± 0.75 MPa) was found for the composites manufactured with 35% RH-conditioned flax fibers, but the shear modulus was reduced consistently with increasing RH values. Although shear strength was increased because of fiber swelling with increased moisture absorption rate until 35% RH environments with good microstructures, nonetheless, strength and modulus both started to decrease after this range. A very poor microstructure has been affirmed by the SEM images of the composite samples conditioned at 90% RH environments.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xiao Ding</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shuan-Cheng Gu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With regard to the excavation of coal mine tunnels, the phenomenon of roof separation frequently occurs owing to the deformation of roadway surrounding rocks, and the analysis of the influence of surrounding rock separation on bolt reinforcement plays an indispensable role in the security of support engineering. In the present paper, the hyperbolic function model of bolt load transfer is simplified to the exponential function form, and the simplified distribution form is modified by error analysis. Drawing on the analytic model of elastoplastic mechanics of bolt load through separation, this paper further investigates the influence of separation development on bolt load and conducts the parametric analysis of the separation value and separation position. Finally, taking the separation effect into consideration in the anchorage design of coal mine, practical reference value has been attached to the supporting design of underground engineering in bedded rock mass.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), is increasing worldwide; nevertheless, it is still unknown if this is the case in Mexico. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution and trends of hospital discharges (HD) (for the period between 2004 and 2015) and deaths (for the period between 2004 and 2013) reported for UC and CD in Mexico. Methods. Quantitative cross-sectional study was performed. Secondary data sources analysis was performed through Dynamic Cubes of the General Direction of Health Information; variables were categorized by diagnosis, age, sex, and state. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences between the first and last years that were studied. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS v.24. Results. The number of HD increased by 98.9% between 2004 and 2015 (IBD: p=0.033, CD: p=0.009, UC: p=0.051); it was more frequent, for both sexes and diagnoses, between 15 and 44 years, with a second peak for men with UC (between 45 and 64 years). Deaths increased by 96.2% from 2004 to 2011 (IBD: p=0.056, CD: p=0.064, UC: p=0.04). UC is three times more frequent than CD. Mexico City has the highest number of HD (4,179; 22.7%) while the state of Veracruz has the highest number of deaths (273; 38.2%). Conclusions. HD for IBD in Mexico is increasing significantly; the number of deaths increased until 2011, but from then on, they are apparently decreasing. IBD affects Mexican people without any gender predominance, often affecting patients between 15 and 44 years of age. UC is three times more frequent than CD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Under long-term temperature loading, long bridges stretch and deform, causing the beam and rail to move relative to each other. This phenomenon could cause a gradual slide of the rail relative to the fastener composite pad and ultimately results in the slipping out of the fastener pad at the end of the ballastless track bridge changes. The slipping out of the fastener composite pad changes the longitudinal resistance of the fastener and causes shock of the train on the rail structure due to direct contact between the rail and the tie, thus inhibiting the normal use of the line. In this paper, a reciprocating tensile test was carried out on a WJ-8 small resistance fastener to explore the breaking process of the fastener composite pad, identify the interaction mechanism of the fastener composite pad under the rail, and ultimately determine the influence of the pad on the longitudinal resistance of the fastener. The results show that the two factors that affect the longitudinal resistance of the fastener under reciprocating loading are the surface roughness and displacement of the fastener composite pad. While the surface roughness of the fastener composite pad is the main influencing factor in the early stage, the displacement of the composite pad has a greater impact on the later stage. The research results of this paper can provide an important reference for the maintenance and repair of ballastless track fasteners on bridges.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Class 3 obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) is a growing health problem worldwide associated with considerable comorbidity including Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The multidisciplinary medical management of obesity can be difficult in T2DM due to potential weight gain from medications including sulphonylureas and insulin. However, newer weight-neutral/losing diabetes medications can aid additional weight loss. The aim of this study was to compare weight loss outcomes of patients with and without T2DM, and in patients with T2DM, to compare diabetes outcomes and change in medications at 6 months. Methods. All patients entering a multidisciplinary weight management metabolic program in a publicly funded hospital clinic in Sydney between March 2018 and March 2019, with BMI≥40 kg/m2 and aged ≥18 years were included. Data was collected from patient clinical and electronic notes at baseline and 6 months. Results. Of the 180 patients who entered the program, 53.3% had T2DM at baseline. There was no difference in percentage weight loss in those with or without T2DM (4.2±4.9% vs. 3.6±4.7%, p=0.35). Additionally, T2DM patients benefited from a 0.47% reduction in HbA1c (p&lt;0.01) and a reduction in the number of medications from baseline to 6 months (1.8±1.0/patient vs. 1.0±1.2/patient, p&lt;0.001). T2DM patients who started on weigh-neutral/losing medications in the program lost more weight than those started on weight-gaining medications (7.7±5.3% vs. 2.4±3.8%, p=0.015). Conclusions. Patients with class 3 obesity had significant weight loss at 6 months in this program. Patients with T2DM at baseline had comparable weight loss at 6 months, a significant improvement in glycaemic control, and a reduction in diabetes medication load. Additionally, patients with T2DM who were started on weight-neutral/losing medications lost significantly more weight than those started on weight-gaining medications, and these medications should be preferentially used in class 3 obesity and comorbid T2DM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, a large number of edge computing devices have been used to monitor the operating state of industrial equipment and perform fault diagnosis analysis. Therefore, the fault diagnosis algorithm in the edge computing device is particularly important. With the increase in the number of device detection points and the sampling frequency, mechanical health monitoring has entered the era of big data. Edge computing can process and analyze data in real time or faster, making data processing closer to the source, rather than the external data center or cloud, which can shorten the delay time. After using 8 bits and 16 bits to quantify the deep measurement learning model, there is no obvious loss of accuracy compared with the original floating-point model, which shows that the model can be deployed and reasoned on the edge device, while ensuring real time. Compared with using servers for deployment, using edge devices not only reduces costs but also makes deployment more flexible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), discovered and isolated from the bone marrow in the 1960s and with self-renewal capacity and multilineage differentiation potential, have valuable immunomodulatory abilities. Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to rapid renal failure, which exhibits as quickly progressive decreasing excretion in few hours or days. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of AKI induced by ischemia-reperfusion using a meta-analysis method. A literature search using corresponding terms was performed in the following databases: Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science databases up to Dec 31, 2019. Data for outcomes were identified, and the efficacy of MSCs for AKI was assessed using Cochrane Review Manager Version 5.3. Nineteen studies were eligible and recruited for this meta-analysis. MSC treatment can reduce the Scr levels at 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, and &gt;7 days (1 day: WMD=−0.56, 95% CI: -0.78, -0.34, P&lt;0.00001; 2 days: WMD=−0.58, 95% CI: -0.89, -0.28, P=0.0002; 3 days: WMD=−0.65, 95% CI: -0.84, -0.45, P&lt;0.00001; 5 days: WMD=−0.35, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.16, P=0.0003; and &gt;7 days: WMD=−0.22, 95% CI: -0.36, -0.08, P=0.002) and can reduce the levels of BUN at 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 5 days (1 day: WMD=−11.72, 95% CI: -18.80, -4.64, P=0.001; 2 days: WMD=−33.60, 95% CI: -40.15, -27.05, P&lt;0.00001; 3 days: WMD=−21.14, 95% CI: -26.15, -16.14, P&lt;0.00001; and 5 days: WMD=−8.88, 95% CI: -11.06, -6.69, P&lt;0.00001), and it also can reduce the levels of proteinuria at 3 days and &gt;7 days and alleviate the renal damage in animal models of AKI. In conclusion, MSCs might be a promising therapeutic agent for AKI induced by ischemia-reperfusion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Exponential moments (EMs) are important radial orthogonal moments, which have good image description ability and have less information redundancy compared with other orthogonal moments. Therefore, it has been used in various fields of image processing in recent years. However, EMs can only take integer order, which limits their reconstruction and antinoising attack performances. The promotion of fractional-order exponential moments (FrEMs) effectively alleviates the numerical instability problem of EMs; however, the numerical integration errors generated by the traditional calculation methods of FrEMs still affect the accuracy of FrEMs. Therefore, the Gaussian numerical integration (GNI) is used in this paper to propose an accurate calculation method of FrEMs, which effectively alleviates the numerical integration error. Extensive experiments are carried out in this paper to prove that the GNI method can significantly improve the performance of FrEMs in many aspects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is closely related to diabetes and kidney diseases and is expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Objective. This study aimed to explore the circulating expression level and significance of lncRNA Malat1 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Methods. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was conducted to assess the expression of lncRNA Malat1 in 20 T2DM patients, 27 DKD patients, and 14 healthy controls, and then, the clinical significance was analyzed. Results. LncRNA MALAT1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was significantly upregulated in T2DM and DKD groups when compared to control. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed correlation of lncRNA MALAT1 levels with ACR, urine β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), urine α1-microglobulin (α1-MG), creatinine (Cr), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), while negative with superoxide dismutase (SOD) (r=−0.388, P&lt;0.05). Binary regression analysis showed that ACR, creatinine, α1-MG, and LncRNA Malat1 were the risk factors for diabetic nephropathy with OR value of 1.166, 1.031, 1.031, and 2.019 (P&lt;0.05). The area under ROC curve (AUC) of DKD identified by the above indicators was 0.914, 0.643, 0.807, and 0.797, respectively. The AUC of Joint prediction probability of DKD recognition was 0.914, and the sensitivity and specificity of DKD diagnosis were 1.0 and 0.806, respectively. (Take ≥0.251 as the diagnostic cutoff point). Conclusion. LncRNA Malat1 is highly expressed in DKD patients, and the combined detection of ACR, creatinine, α1-MG, and LncRNA Malat1 with diabetes mellitus may be the best way to diagnose diabetic nephropathy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Family with sequence similarity 19 member A5 (FAM19A5), a novel chemokine-like peptide, is a secreted protein mainly expressed in the brain. FAM19A5 was recently found to be involved in a variety of neurological diseases; however, its correlation with vascular dementia (VaD) remains unclear. The aim of the study is to explore the association between serum FAM19A5 and cognitive impairment in subjects with VaD. Method. 136 VaD subjects and 81 normal controls were recruited in the study. Their demographic and clinical baseline data were collected on admission. All subjects received Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) evaluation, which was used to test their cognitive functions. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to detect the serum levels of FAM19A5. Results. No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding the demographic and clinical baseline data (p&gt;0.05). The serum FAM19A5 levels were significantly higher compared to normal controls (p&lt;0.001). The Spearman correlation analysis indicated that serum FAM19A5 levels and MMSE scores have a significant negative correlation in VaD patients (r=−0.414, &lt;0.001). Further multiple regression analysis indicated that serum FAM19A5 levels were independent risk predictors for cognitive functions in VaD (β=0.419, p=0.031). Conclusion. The serum FAM19A5 level of VaD patients is significantly increased, which may serve as a biomarker to predict cognitive function of VaD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and multifactorial autoimmune disorder with the involvement of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50 RA genetic loci in European populations. Given the anticipated overlap of RA-relevant genes and pathways across different ethnic groups, we sought to replicate 58 GWAS-implicated SNPs reported in Europeans in Pakistani subjects. 1,959 unrelated subjects comprising 1,222 RA cases and 737 controls were collected from three rheumatology facilities in Pakistan. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX or TaqMan® methods. A total of 50 SNPs were included in the final association analysis after excluding those that failed assay design/run or postrun QC analysis. Fourteen SNPs (LINC00824/rs1516971, PADI4/rs2240336, CEP57/rs4409785, CTLA4/rs3087243, STAT4/rs13426947, HLA-B/MICA/rs2596565, C5orf30/rs26232, CCL21/rs951005, GATA3/rs2275806, VPS37C/rs595158, HLA-DRB1/rs660895, EOMES/rs3806624, SPRED2/rs934734, and RUNX1/rs9979383) were replicated in our Pakistani sample at false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.20 with nominal p values ranging from 4.73E-06 to 3.48E-02. Our results indicate that several RA susceptibility loci are shared between Pakistani and European populations, supporting the role of common genes/pathways.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Internet has revolutionized the patterns of financial development and economic growth. To assess the impacts of internet penetration on the financial industry, this paper analyzed ten-year Chinese provincial panel data and concluded that regional Internet penetration accelerates financial development. Furthermore, the efficiency of Internet investment in underdeveloped provinces is better than that in developed provinces. More meaningfully, Internet penetration promotes the transparency of the securities market and regional financial participation. This indicates that Internet technology facilitates the advancement of the finance industry and the securities market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Context. Pharmaceutical products are the leading cause accidental poisoning in middle- and high-income countries. Patterns of poisoning with medicinal drugs change across different geographic regions and over decades owing to variability in prescription practice, sociocultural factors, safe storage of medicines, and free availability of over the counter medications. Methods. This multicentre descriptive study was conducted over a seven-year period (February 2007 to January 2014) to assess patterns and trends of medicinal drug-related poisoning among children less than 12 years of age in thirty-six hospitals across rural Sri Lanka. Children with both accidental and deliberate medication poisonings and medication errors were recruited to the study. Data on poisoning events and medication errors were gathered via patient/parent interviews using multistructured questionnaires that assessed demographic factors, first aid measures, location and circumstances of poisoning, clinical management, and complications. In addition, focus group discussions were performed on all children and their families who had deliberate poisoning events and medication errors. Results and Conclusions. Among 1621 children presented with acute poisoning over seven years of age, 410 children had acute poisoning with medications. Male children (225, 54.9%) outnumbered female children. Paracetomol (137, 35.6%), salbutamol (55, 14.3%), and chlorpheniramine (35, 9.1%) were the most commonly poisoned medications. Prospective data at Anuradhapura teaching hospital (n = 112) revealed that unsafe first aid measures were practiced on 22 (19.6%) children. Although the majority of children remained asymptomatic (61, 54.5%), neurological symptoms (34, 67%) were predominantly seen in symptomatic children. The majority of poisonings took place within home premises (76, 67.9%). There were 16 reports of medication errors (14.2% of acute poisoning events) either due to erroneous administration by caregivers or erroneous issue of medicines by health workers. The current study did not observe mortality following medication poisonings. This study brings to light the burden of medicinal drug-related poisoning morbidity among children in rural Sri Lanka. Potentially, interventions such as community educational initiatives, written safety warnings, increased use of child resistant containers, and enforcement of laws to bring down accidental medication poisonings need to be implemented, and their effectiveness should be evaluated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of this study was to examine families’ experiences living with acquired brain injury (ABI) using a research approach that included both the affected individual family member and the family together as a family group. A narrative inquiry study, informed by the life-stage approach of Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, and Zilber, was used to obtain family stories. Families experiencing an ABI event were purposefully selected from different regions in a western Canadian province. Centered on the life stages of before the ABI event, now living with the ABI, and the future, thematic findings included: Families, a grounding force; Losses, individual and family; Family adaptive capacities; Experiences with the healthcare system-hospital to home; and A patchwork future-entering the unknown. Themes affirmed the significant impacts of ABI on individual and family members and acknowledged ABI as an ambiguous loss event. The findings also illuminated families’ strengths and resiliencies in coping with living with ABI. The study results suggest by “thinking family” nurses can contribute towards a healthcare model that focuses on “family” as the central unit of care.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Shale reservoirs have the characterizations of low porosity, low permeability, and hydrocarbon organic matter self-generation and self-storage, resulting in its complex flow mechanisms. Compared with fractured vertical wells, multiple-fractured horizontal wells are widely used due to their advantages of effectively increasing the well control range and further expanding the drainage area. To further study the multiscale flow mechanisms of shale gas, a flow model was established that considered viscous flow in microfractures and inorganic pores, the diffusion of Knudsen in nanoscale porosity, the coexistence of slippage, adsorption-desorption effects under infinity, and closed outer boundary conditions; based on the continuous point source solution, a multiple-fractured horizontal well flow model was established and solved by MATLAB programming. Then, the effects of various factors were investigated. The results show that the Knudsen diffusion and slippage coefficients mainly affect the apparent permeability of the matrix pores. The more the Knudsen diffusion and slippage coefficients are, the earlier the turbulent flow occurs and the higher the gas production is.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This article is a preliminary investigational study that is aimed at giving hints about the interesting biomarkers involved in the transition process from low-grade cervix lesion to invasive cervical cancer. Our study focuses on the risk factors and tumour molecular changes in one patient. First in 1986, she was diagnosed a preinvasive cervix lesion. Then, 16 years later, she was diagnosed an invasive cervical cancer. The 2002 diagnosis was a squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, stage IIIB (FIGO), whereas in 1986, she had been diagnosed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial cervical lesion. Retrospectively, the analysis of samples of preneoplastic lesions and invasive cervical cancer confirmed the histopathological diagnoses and detected the presence of HPV type and HPV-16 variants, as well as the overexpression of proteins such as hTERT, IGF1Rα, IGF1Rβ, CAIX, and GLUT1. Finally, the Arg72Pro polymorphism was detected in TP53. The role of high-risk HPV and HPV-16 variants and of hTERT, IGF1Rα, IGF1Rβ, CAIX, and GLUT1 variations seemed confirmed in the development and progression of cervical cancer. As a result, analyzing the molecular changes in one and same tumour that progresses from a low-grade cervix lesion to invasive cervical cancer could provide valuable information in order to improve detection, diagnosis, and treatment in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Serum endothelin-1 is increasingly released in acute myocardial infarction, by necrotic cardiomyocytes. In non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI), increased serum endothelin-1 on-admission may have clinical significance during acute hospitalisation events. Objective. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether increased serum endothelin-1 level predict adverse cardiac events in patients hospitalized with Non-STEMI. Methods. The design of this research was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive subjects with Non-STEMI undergoing symptom onset ≤24 hour were enrolled and observed during intensive hospitalization. Serum endothelin-1, troponin-I, and hs-C reactive protein were measured from peripheral blood taken on-admission. In-hospital adverse cardiac events were a composite of death, acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, reinfarction, and resuscitated VT/VF. Results. We enrolled 66 subjects. The incidence of in-hospital adverse cardiac events is 13.6% (10 out of 66 subjects). Serum endothelin-1 level was significantly higher in subjects with in-hospital adverse cardiac events. Subjects with endothelin-1 level &gt;2.59 pg/mL independently predicted adverse cardiac events in hospitalised Non-STEMI patients (adjusted odds ratio 44.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.44-1372.99, p value 0.03). The serum endothelin-1 level was correlated with serum troponin I level (correlation coefficient of 0.413, p value 0.012). Conclusion. Increased serum endothelin-1 on-admission correlated with increased troponin-I and independently predicted in-hospital adverse cardiac events in patients with Non-STEMI.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain as one of the most global problematic metabolic diseases with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence. Epidemiological studies noted that T2DM patients have by two-fold increase to develop NAFLD, and vice versa. This complex and intricate association is supported and mediated by insulin resistance (IR). In this review, we discuss the NAFLD immunopathogenesis, connection with IR and T2DM, the role of screening and noninvasive tools, and mostly the impact of the current antidiabetic drugs on steatosis liver and new potential therapeutic targets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. We aimed to determine the perioperative changes in the quality of life (QoL) in patients with acromegaly and to reveal the relationship between biochemical indicators and quality of life change after tumor resection. Methods. Patients with acromegaly were enrolled from a tertiary pituitary center. SF-36 scale and AcroQoL scale were used to determine the QoL before and after surgery. We analyzed changes in QoL using a generalized linear model for repeated measurements. We compared the changes in QoL among three groups (remission, active, and discordant group) based on postoperative growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1. Results. 151 patients (75 males and 76 females) diagnosed with acromegaly were included. The average age was 43.9 ± 12.3 years. The median total SF-36 scale was 65.3% (IQR: 63.2%–69.2%). Overall AcroQoL score at baseline was 59.1% (IQR: 51.8%–71.8%). Nadir GH levels (coefficient −0.08, p=0.047), T3 levels (coefficient 2.8, p=0.001), and testosterone levels (coefficient −0.20, p=0.033) in males were independent predictive factors of the total SF-36 score. During the follow-up, the median overall SF-36 score increased to 66.1% at 3 months and 75.3% at 6 months (p&lt;0.001) after surgery. The median overall AcroQoL score increased to 74.5% at 3 months and 77.3% at 6 months (p&lt;0.001) after surgery. At 6-month follow-up, median scores were still less than 70% in appearance, vitality, and mental health dimensions. The QoL after surgery were similar among the three groups, although higher GH and more preoperative somatostatin analogs usage were observed in the active group. Conclusion. In conclusion, acromegalic patients were associated with low QoL, which could be reversed partially by surgery. The improvement was independent of the endocrine remission. Appearance, vitality, and mental health were three major aspects that warrant further attention from physicians and caregivers after surgery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a mediator of microglial activation at the transcriptional level. The involvement of the epigenetic mechanism in this process is largely undefined. Histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2 are considered important epigenetic regulators of gene expression in activated microglia. In this study, we examined the effect of CGRP on HDAC2-mediated gene transcription in microglial cells through the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that mouse microglial cells (BV2) expressed CGRP receptor components. Treatment of microglia with CGRP increased HDAC2 protein expression. ChIP-seq data indicated that CGRP remarkably altered promoter enrichments of HDAC2 in microglial cells. We identified 1271 gene promoters, whose HDAC2 enrichments are significantly altered in microglia after CGRP treatment, including 1181 upregulating genes and 90 downregulating genes. Bioinformatics analyses showed that HDAC2-enriched genes were mainly associated with immune- and inflammation-related pathways, such as nitric oxide synthase (NOS) biosynthetic process, retinoic acid-inducible gene- (RIG-) like receptor signaling pathway, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The expression of these key pathways (NOS, RIG-I, and NF-κB) were further verified by Western blot. Taken together, our findings suggest that genes with differential HDAC2 enrichments induced by CGRP function in diverse cellular pathways and many are involved in immune and inflammatory responses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Many people in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from protein malnutrition; this results in negative health and economic impacts. Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC.) is a tropical underutilized legume with beneficial nutritional characteristics such as high protein content, which may help to alleviate these problems. The proximate composition (fat, moisture content, crude protein, ash, and carbohydrate) and antinutrient (tannin and phytate) level of winged bean seeds and tubers were determined using 50 accessions. In the processed seeds, accession Tpt17 had the highest protein content (40.30%) and Tpt48 the lowest (34.18%). In the unprocessed seeds, Tpt17 also recorded the highest crude protein (31.13%) with Tpt125 having the lowest (28.43%). In the tubers, protein content ranged from 19.07% (Tpt42) to 12.26% (Tpt10). The moisture content in the processed seeds ranged from 8.51% (Tpt42) to 6.72% (Tpt6); in the unprocessed seeds, it was between 8.53% (Tpt53) and 3.76% (Tpt14). In the processed seeds, the values of ash ranged from 4.93% (Tpt126) to 4.45% (Tpt15-4); in the unprocessed seeds, it ranged from 4.98% (Tpt17) to 4.55% (Tpt125). In the processed seeds, the fat content ranged from 18.91% (Tpt51) to 14.09% (Tp43) while in the unprocessed seeds, the values ranged from 19.01% (Tpt15) to 13.87% (Tpt3-B). The crude fiber in the processed samples ranged from 13.82% (Tpt6) to 10.40% (Tpt125) while in the unprocessed seeds, it ranged from 7.29% in Tpt51 to 4.83% in Tpt11. Carbohydrate content in the processed seeds ranged from 26.30% (Tpt3-B) to 20.94% (Tpt125) and 39.76% in Tpt3-B to 34.53% in Tpt18 in the unprocessed seeds. The tannin and phytate contents showed remarkably significant differences. In the tubers harvested, significant variation was observed in the parameters evaluated. Winged bean flour could be formulated into various meals for children and adults to reduce malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Current clinical guidelines for management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) emphasize good glycemic control. However, this has limited effect on prevention of DPN in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. This study investigates the effect of insulin treatment on development of DPN in a rat model of T2D to assess the underlying causes leading to DPN. Methods. Twelve-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to a normal chow diet or a 45% kcal high-fat diet. After eight weeks, the high-fat fed animals received a mild dose of streptozotocin to induce hyperglycemia. Four weeks after diabetes induction, the diabetic animals were allocated into three treatment groups receiving either no insulin or insulin-releasing implants in a high or low dose. During the 12-week treatment period, blood glucose and body weight were monitored weekly, whereas Hargreaves’ test was performed four, eight, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation. At study termination, several blood parameters, body composition, and neuropathy endpoints were assessed. Results. Insulin treatment lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, both doses of insulin lowered lipids and increased body fat percentage. High-dose insulin treatment attenuated small nerve fiber damage assessed by Hargreaves’ test and intraepidermal nerve fiber density compared to untreated diabetes and low-dose insulin; however, neuropathy was not completely prevented by tight glycemic control. Linear regression analysis revealed that glycemic status, circulating lipids, and sciatic nerve sorbitol level were all negatively associated with the small nerve fiber damage observed. Conclusion. In summary, our data suggest that high-dose insulin treatment attenuates small nerve fiber damage. Furthermore, data also indicate that both poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia are associated with disease progression. Consequently, this rat model of T2D seems to fit well with progression of DPN in humans and could be a relevant preclinical model to use in relation to research investigating treatment opportunities for DPN.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Although noncoding RNAs, especially the microRNAs, have been found to play key roles in CRC development in intestinal tissue, the specific mechanism of these microRNAs has not been fully understood. Methods. GEO and TCGA database were used to explore the microRNA expression profiles of normal mucosa, adenoma, and carcinoma. And the differential expression genes were selected. Computationally, we built the SVM model and multivariable Cox regression model to evaluate the performance of tumorigenic microRNAs in discriminating the adenomas from normal tissues and risk prediction. Results. In this study, we identified 20 miRNA biomarkers dysregulated in the colon adenomas. The functional enrichment analysis showed that MAPK activity and MAPK cascade were highly enriched by these tumorigenic microRNAs. We also investigated the target genes of the tumorigenic microRNAs. Eleven genes, including PIGF, TPI1, KLF4, RARS, PCBP2, EIF5A, HK2, RAVER2, HMGN1, MAPK6, and NDUFA2, were identified to be frequently targeted by the tumorigenic microRNAs. The high AUC value and distinct overall survival rates between the two risk groups suggested that these tumorigenic microRNAs had the potential of diagnostic and prognostic value in CRC. Conclusions. The present study revealed possible mechanisms and pathways that may contribute to tumorigenesis of CRC, which could not only be used as CRC early detection biomarkers, but also be useful for tumorigenesis mechanism studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Predicting CO2 emission prices is an important and challenging task for policy makers and market participants, as carbon prices follow a stochastic process of complex time series with nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics. Existing literature has focused on highly precise point forecasting, but it cannot correctly solve the uncertainties related to carbon price datasets in most cases. This study aims to develop a hybrid forecasting model to estimate in advance the maximum or minimum loss in the stochastic process of CO2 emission trading price fluctuation. This model can granulate raw data into fuzzy-information granular components with minimum (Low), average (R), and maximum (Up) values as changing space-description parameters. Furthermore, it can forecast carbon prices’ changing space with Low, R, and Up as inputs to support a vector regression. This method’s feasibility and effectiveness is examined using empirical experiments on European Union allowances’ spot and futures prices under the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. The proposed FIG-SVM model exhibits fewer errors and superior performance than ARIMA, ARFIMA, and Markov-switching methods. This study provides several important implications for investors and risk managers involved in trading carbon financial products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>2-Keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG), the direct precursor of vitamin C, is produced by a two-step fermentation route from D-sorbitol in industry. However, this route is a complicated mix-culture system which involves three bacteria. Thus, replacement of the conventional two-step fermentation process with a one-step process could be revolutionary in vitamin C industry. The one-step fermentation of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) has been achieved in our previous study; 32.4 g/L of 2-KLG production was obtained by the one-step strain G. oxydans/pGUC-tufB-sdh-GGGGS-sndh after 168 h. In this study, L-sorbose dehydrogenase (SDH) and L-sorbosone dehydrogenase (SNDH) were expressed in G. oxydans after the codon optimization. Furthermore, the trimeric protein CutA was used to improve the chemical structure stability of SDH and SNDH. The recombinant strain G. oxydans/pGUC-tufB-SH3-sdh-GGGGS-sndh-tufB-SH3lig-(GGGGS)2-cutA produced 40.3 g/L of 2-KLG after 168 h. In addition, the expression levels of the cofactor PQQ were enhanced to further improve 2-KLG production. With the stepwise metabolic engineering of G. oxydans, the final 2-KLG production was improved to 42.6 g/L. The efficient one-step production of 2-KLG was achieved, and the final one-step industrial-scale production of 2-KLG is drawing near.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The reasonable sharing and effective integration of data is the premise of improving the comprehensive governance ability of society through data empowerment. It can be determined that the fine-grained splitting of microservice framework can promote the reasonable sharing and effective integration of data. However, how to determine the granularity of microservice splitting is a multiparameter and multiobjective decision-making problem, which is also a key basic problem to be solved urgently both in academic research and application. From the perspective of application, this paper puts forward the criteria and basic framework that can guide the microservice splitting, and for the first time, based on the perspective of maintainability, it gives the decision criteria and methods of microservice splitting granularity. After the theoretical research, this paper also takes the provincial microservice governance of food and drug regulation as an example: the example shows that the framework and methods proposed can effectively improve data sharing and system expandability. Through microservice governance, collaborative social governance featuring “one network to achieve management objectives, one network to realize comprehensive business processing, one network for comprehensive view of all information” can be achieved. It is an exemplary mode worth popularization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Systemic manifestation of toxoplasmosis is commonly seen in immune-compromised individuals. Skin manifestations are seen commonly in conjunction with systemic features. Isolated cutaneous toxoplasmosis is extraordinarily rare in immunocompetent patients. Case Description. A 64-year-old female presented to the Dermatology Outpatient Department (OPD), with a nonhealing ulcer over dorsum of the left hand for one year. The patient did not have any systemic diseases. Serology tests were negative. An incisional biopsy of the lesion revealed dense inflammatory cell infiltrates comprising predominantly of plasma cells and lymphocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and focal abscess formation in the dermis. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain showed organisms in the dermis with morphological resemblance to tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii. Conclusion. Though rare, a possibility of primary cutaneous toxoplasmosis should always be considered and looked for, even in immunocompetent patients presenting with chronic nonhealing ulcers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. Coronary artery diseases (CAD) are clinical cardiovascular events associated with dyslipidemia in common. The interaction between environmental and genetic factors can be responsible for CAD. The present paper aimed to examine the association between c.56C &gt; G (rs3135506) APOA5 gene polymorphism and CAD in Moroccan individuals and to perform an association update meta-analysis. Materials and Methods. The c.56C &gt; G variant was genotyped in 122 patients with CAD and 134 unrelated controls. Genetic association analysis and comparison of biochemical parameters were performed using R statistical language. In addition, a comprehensive meta-analysis including eleven published studies in addition to our case-control study results was conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Publication bias was examined by Egger’s test and funnel plot. Results. The case-control study data showed that the c.56C &gt; G polymorphism was associated with CAD susceptibility under codominant (P-value = 0.001), recessive (P-value &lt;0.001) and log-additive (P-value = 0.008) inheritance models. In addition, this polymorphism was significantly associated with increased levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, glycemia, and total cholesterol. Furthermore, meta-analysis showed a significant association between the c.56C &gt; G gene polymorphism and increased risk of CAD under recessive (OR = 3.39[1.77–6.50], P value &lt;0.001) and homozygote codominant (OR = 3.96[2.44–6.45], P value &lt;0.001) models. Conclusion. Our case-control study revealed a significant association between c.56C &gt; G polymorphism and CAD in the Moroccan population. In addition, meta-analysis data supported the implication of this polymorphism in CAD susceptibility.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Internet users have grown substantially over the last decade, especially following the emergence of mobile technology. Most Internet connections nowadays are accessed using mobile devices in order to stay connected all the time and everywhere. Owing to the limited coverage of such access points as well as base stations, mobile devices are required to handover connectivity if there is a move to other locations. Horizontal handover is conducted when the movement is within the same network. Otherwise, there must be vertical handover when external network infrastructure is encountered. However, as the Internet is an open network that naturally lacks trust between users, the mobile nodes that move to an external network are susceptible to various attacking activities. Compromising mobile nodes may cause users to lose their data as well as destroy their mobile devices in terms of both software and hardware. Securing mobile devices is crucial in order to avoid losses in terms of not only money but also facilities. Although mobile nodes have been developed with certain security features, some researchers have found vulnerabilities. This paper surveys in detail the security vulnerabilities of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and the current relevant mitigation methods. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and its security vulnerability as well as security mechanisms proposed by researchers. Based on the survey, there are apparently weaknesses in current security features that are in need of solutions to minimize the effect of malicious activities. An open direction of future research on mobile IPv6 vertical handover security is elaborated at the end of this paper.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the last two decades, the IEEE 8201.11 family has multiplied data rate transmissions in wireless local area networks (WLANs). This progress is based on the adoption of new technologies concerning physical layer (PHY), combined with the enhancements in the medium access control (MAC) layer. Radio over Fiber (RoF) is a technology which can further extend this progress, combining the benefits of optical fiber and wireless networks. The current IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is contention based, which leads to low utilization of the RoF PHY data rate and on the other hand cannot handle the effects of long propagation delays in RoF networks. In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Link Time Division Multiple Access (HL-TDMA) MAC protocol which addresses the above shortcomings and enhances the performance of both conventional and RoF WLANs. Then, through simulation, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, which is shown to be superior to relevant RoF WLAN protocols in the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accurate estimation of satellite-derived ocean latent heat flux (LHF) at high spatial resolution remains a major challenge. Here, we estimate monthly ocean LHF at 4 km spatial resolution over 5 years using bulk algorithm COARE 3.0, driven by satellite data and meteorological variables from reanalysis. We validated the estimated ocean LHF by multiyear observations and by comparison with seven ocean LHF products. Validation results from monthly observations at 96 widely distributed buoy sites from three buoy site arrays (TAO, PIRATA, and RAMA) indicated a bias of less than 7 W/m2 with R2 of more than 0.80 (p&lt;0.01) and with a King–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of over 0.84. Our estimated ocean LHF also performs well in simulating annual variability and predicting between-site variability, as indicated by a bias of lower than 6 W/m2 and an R2 of more than 0.84 (p&lt;0.01). Overall, the average KGE for estimated ocean LHF increased by 18%–23% compared to other LHF products, indicating robust LHF estimation performance. Importantly, our estimated annual ocean LHF has similar global spatial distribution compared to other LHF products, although there are general differences in LHF values due to the difference in the models and the spatial resolution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Even though the validity of accelerometers for the measurement of energy expenditure (EE) has been demonstrated for normal-weight individuals, the applicability of this instrument in obese individuals remains controversial. This review aims to summarize the level of agreement between accelerometers and the gold standards (indirect calorimetry and doubly labelled water) for the measurement of energy expenditure (EE) in obese or overweight individuals. Methods. The literature search was limited to comparison studies assessing agreement in EE determination between accelerometers and indirect calorimetry (IC) or doubly labelled water (DLW). We searched in PubMed and in Scopus until March 1, 2019. The analysis was restricted to obese or overweight adult individuals. The following descriptive information was extracted for each study: sample size, characteristics of participants (sex, age, BMI, fat mass percentage, any pathological conditions, modality of recruitment in the study, and exclusion criteria), accelerometer description (model, type and body position), and type of gold standard and validity protocol (duration, conditions, and requirements during and before the experiment). Three review authors independently screened the obtained results, and the quality of the selected articles was assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. Results. We obtained seventeen eligible articles, thirteen of which showed concerns for the applicability section, due to the patient selection. Regarding the accelerometers, nine devices were validated in the included studies with the BodyMedia SenseWear® (SWA) being the most frequently validated. Although correlations between accelerometers and the gold standard were high in some studies, agreement between the two methods was low, as shown by the Bland–Altman plots. Conclusions. Most accelerometer estimations of EE were inaccurate for obese/overweight subjects, and authors advise to improve the accuracy of algorithms for SWA software, or the predicted equations for estimating EE from other accelerometers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Planetary gearboxes are widely used in mechanical transmission systems due to their large transmission ratio and high transmission efficiency. In a planetary gearbox, the sun gear is usually set to float to balance the sharing of loads among planet gears. However, this floating set will result in the variation of pressure angle, overlap ratio, and meshing phase in the meshing progress and when gear faults occur, the variation will be enlarged. In the previous studies, these parameters were reduced to constant. To study the influence of the dynamic parameters on the vibration response of planetary gearboxes under different operating conditions, a new lumped-parameter model containing the time-varying pressure angle (TVPA), time-varying overlap ratio (TVOR), and time-varying meshing phase (TVMP) is established. Based on this model, the vibration response mechanism of the sun gear is analyzed. Moreover, the comparison with the previous model is made and the rule of phase modulation caused by these dynamic parameters is revealed. By comparing the dynamic responses under different loads and rotation speeds, the phase modulation is studied in detail. Finally, the sun gear fault is introduced, and the phase modulation is analyzed in different fault degrees. This study can provide theoretical reference for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox based on vibration analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a progressive occlusive cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by abnormal angiogenesis at the base of the brain. This pathological abnormal angiogenesis is susceptible to disturbances, including spontaneous hemorrhage and vasogenic edema. However, the underlying mechanisms of pathological angiogenesis and occurrence of hemorrhage are unclear. Angiopoietins play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of central nervous system disorders in angiogenesis. This study was aimed at examining whether angiopoietins are associated with formation of abnormal collateral vessels and the occurrence of hemorrhage in adult-onset moyamoya disease (HMMD). Methods. A total of 27 consecutive adult patients with HMMD were enrolled from June 2011 to May 2017. Serum levels of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients with HMMD were compared with those with spontaneous hemorrhage (controls) and nonhemorrhagic-onset MMD (NHMMD). Results. Serum Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with adult HMMD than in those with spontaneous hemorrhage and NHMMD. The ROC curve identified that a baseline serum Ang-2 level&gt;1230 ng/ml may be associated with adult HMMD with 88.39% sensitivity and 70.37% specificity (area under the curve (AUC), 0.89; 95% CI, 0.808-0.973; P&lt;0.001). Moreover, serum Ang-2 levels were significantly elevated in stages II, III, and IV. In subgroup analysis of a high and low degree of moyamoya vessels, serum Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in the high moyamoya vessel group than in the low moyamoya vessel group. Serum Ang-2 levels were also significantly higher in the low moyamoya vessel group compared with the control group. Serum Ang-1 levels were not significantly different among the groups. Conclusion. Increased serum Ang-2 levels may contribute to pathological abnormal angiogenesis and/or to the instability of vascular structure and function, thus causing brain hemorrhage in adult HMMD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Buried pipelines serve as a critical component of lifeline systems, such as water and gas supply. They are interconnected to form a network to transport utilities. The connections change the geometry and stiffness of pipelines and impact the seismic response of the pipelines. This paper investigates the influence of connections on the seismic response of buried continuous steel trunk lines. A finite element model is introduced for analyzing the seismic response of buried pipeline networks. The seismic response of continuous steel pipelines with different connections, including cruciform and T-, K-, L-, and Y-shaped, is analyzed. The impact of site class, pipe diameter, branch angle, and angle of wave incidence on the response of pipe connections is explored. An influence coefficient defined to characterize the strain amplification at the connections is proposed for different forms of connections. Engineering measures to reduce the strain amplification at connections are suggested.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The polymer laser sintering (PLS) process is one of the most promising additive manufacturing (AM) technologies for polymeric materials. However, the technique has challenges because the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the polymeric powder deteriorate due to the high temperatures prevailing in the build chamber during manufacture. These high temperatures cause agglomeration of powder, which leads to a decrease in the flowability of powder. There is also a related drop in the coalescence of the powder granules during PLS, which results in porosity that undermines the mechanical integrity of printed parts. Moreover, the viscosity of the melt increases due to cross-linking of molecular chains. This, in turn, increases the tensile strength of the printed components at the expense of the percentage elongation at break. Thus, high prolonged processing temperatures decrease the reusability of polymeric materials used in PLS. In this paper, a review of the studies conducted to investigate ways of reducing the effects of high temperature on polymeric powders is presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bovine mastitis continues to be a leading cause of heavy economic losses in the dairy industry and a public health hazard globally. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence, etiologies of clinical and subclinical mastitis, and associated predisposing factors in Embu and Kajiado counties in Kenya. A semistructured questionnaire was administered to 154 smallholder dairy farmers to collect data on management practices, animal factors, and disease history. A total of 395 dairy cows were initially screened for subclinical mastitis using the California mastitis test (CMT), and milk samples were aseptically collected. Both CMT positive and CMT negative samples were analyzed using conventional bacteriological isolation and identification procedures. In the present study, the overall prevalence of mastitis based on CMT and clinical examination was 80% (316/395), out of which 6.8% (27/395) was clinical mastitis, while 73.1% (289/395) was subclinical mastitis. Based on culture, the overall prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis was 51.6% (815/1580), 74.4% (294/395), and 76.6% (118/154) at the quarter, cow, and farm level, respectively. From the 1574 milk samples analyzed by cultured, 1016 bacteria were yielded. The predominant bacteria were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), 42.8% (435/1016), and in decreasing order, Streptococcus species, 22.2% (226/1016), Staphylococcus aureus, 15.7% (160/1016), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5.1% (52/1016), and the least was Enterobacter species, 0.7% (7/1016), while 23.7% of the sample yielded no bacterial growth. Risk factor analysis revealed that milking mastitic cows last (p=0.002), using a clean udder drying towel for each cow (p=0.033) and previous history of mastitis (p=0.046) were significantly associated with presence of mastitis. The current study has shown a relatively high prevalence of subclinical mastitis with CNS as predominant bacteria. Therefore, control measures are urgently warranted. Management factors such as milking mastitic cows last, using a clean towel for udder drying for each cow, and culling mastitic cows should be considered and included in the Kenyan mastitis control programs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by erosive arthritis, which has not been thoroughly cured yet, and standardized treatment is helpful for alleviating clinical symptoms. Here, various bioinformatics analysis tools were comprehensively utilized, aiming to identify critical biomarkers and possible pathogenesis of RA. Three gene expression datasets profiled by microarray were obtained from GEO database. Dataset GSE55235 and GSE55457 were merged for subsequent analyses. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RStudio with limma package, performing functional enrichment analysis based on GSEA software and clusterProfiler package. Next, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was set up through STRING database and Cytoscape. Moreover, CIBERSORT website was used to assess the inflammatory state of RA. Finally, we validated the candidate hub genes with dataset GSE77298. As a result, we identified 106 DEGs (72 upregulated and 34 downregulated genes). Through GO, KEGG, and GSEA analysis, we found that DEGs were mainly involved in immune response and inflammatory signaling pathway. With the help of Cytoscape software and MCODE plug-in, the most prominent subnetwork was screened out, containing 14 genes and 45 edges. For ROC curve analysis, eight genes with AUC &gt;0.80 were considered as hub genes of RA. In conclusion, compared with healthy controls, the DEGs and their closely related biological functions were analyzed, and we held that chemokines and immune cells infiltration promote the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Targeting the eight biomarkers we identified may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The scientific and feasible method is extremely important for the evaluation of whether the support of coal mines needs to be scrapped, but it has not been formed. If the support cannot be continued to use, the determined reasonable working resistance of the support before the primary mining of coal seam should be optimized. Based on the field measurement and theoretical analysis, the concept of the actual rated working resistance of the support is proposed and analyzed accurately; the total amount of roof subsidence of circulating multiple coal cutting cycles during periodic pressure is calculated; the support performance is evaluated by multifactors; a new method for determining the reasonable working resistance of the support based on dynamic pressure is proposed. The study found that the safety valve of support is opened in advance and the resistance loss rate is large; the total amount of roof subsidence during periodic pressure is high; FAHP + EWM evaluation score of support system performance is 63.31 points. The scientific evaluation of multifactors showed that the support has reached service life, and as a result, the new 105 working faces required replacement with new support. The reasonable working resistance of the support in the 3-1 coal seam is optimized according to the new method based on dynamic pressure. This study can greatly improve the safety of roof control in the working face.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Li Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The continuous coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CCARE) has wide applications in control theory and linear systems. In this paper, by a constructed positive semidefinite matrix, matrix inequalities, and matrix eigenvalue inequalities, we propose a new two-parameter-type upper solution bound of the CCARE. Next, we present an iterative algorithm for finding the tighter upper solution bound of CCARE, prove its boundedness, and analyse its monotonicity and convergence. Finally, corresponding numerical examples are given to illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the derived results.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Fubin Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The traditional composite sandwich structures have disadvantages of low shear modulus and large deformation when used in civil engineering applications. To overcome these problems, this paper proposed a novel composite sandwich panel with upper and lower GFRP skins and a hybrid polyurethane (PU) foam core (GHP panels). The hybrid core is composed of different densities (150, 250, and 350 kg/m3) of the foam core which is divided functionally by horizontal GFRP ribs. The hard core is placed in the compression area to resist compressive strength and improve the stiffness of the composite sandwich structure, while the soft core is placed in the tension area. Six GHP panels were tested loaded in 4-point bending to study the effect of horizontal ribs and hybrid core configurations on the stiffness, strength, and failure modes of GHP panels. Experimental results show that compared to the control panel, a maximum of 54.6% and 50% increase in the strength and bending stiffness can be achieved, respectively. GHP panels with the hybrid PU foam core show obvious secondary stiffness. Finally, analytical methods were proposed to predict the initial stiffness and peak load of the GHP panels, and the results agree well with experimental results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. This study is aimed at investigating natriuretic peptide B (NPPB) coexpression genes and their pathways involved in heart failure (HF) among patients both with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods. The microarray dataset GSE26887, containing 19 postischemic HF patients’ peripheral blood samples (7 with T2DM and 12 without T2DM), was examined to detect the genes coexpressed with NPPB using the corr.test function in the R packet. Furthermore, using online analytical tools, we determined the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the coexpression genes. The modules and hub genes of the PPI network were then identified using the Cytoscape software. Results. In patients with T2DM, a total of 41 biological processes (BP), 20 cellular components (CC), 13 molecular functions (MF), and 41 pathways were identified. Furthermore, a total of 61 BPs, 16 CCs, 13 MFs, and 22 pathways in patients without T2DM were identified. In both groups of patients, 17 BPs, 10 CCs, 6 MFs, and 13 pathways were enriched. We also identified 173 intersectional coexpression genes (63 positively, 106 negatively, and 4 differently coexpressed in patients with and without T2DM, respectively) in both types of patients, which were enriched in 16 BPs, 8 CCs, 3 MFs, and 8 KEGG pathways. Moreover, the PPI network (containing 237 edges and 170 nodes) with the top module significantly enriched in 4 BPs (tricarboxylic acid metabolic process, citrate metabolic process, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and aerobic respiration) and 3 pathways (citrate cycle, malaria parasite metabolic pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications) was constructed. DECR1, BGN, TIMP1, VCAN, and CTCF are the top hub genes. Conclusions. Our findings may elucidate the functions and roles of the NPPB gene in patients with postischemic HF and facilitate HF management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To present long-term results of modified bleb-limiting conjunctivoplasty as a successful treatment for intractable bleb dysesthesia and to review the literature on the surgical management of dysesthetic bleb. Methods. Consecutive case series and literature review. We present four cases of surgically reduced painful blebs. Our technique consisted of the following steps: (1) conjunctival, radial incision to the bare sclera in the desired limit of the bleb; (2) suturing with buried, interrupted sutures at the nearest edge of the filtering bleb; (3) lower limbal peritomy including unwanted area of the extended bleb; (4) dissection and removal of the underlying fibrous tissue when present; (5) conjunctival and resorbable sutures. In addition, a systematic literature review was performed. Only reports presenting outcomes of surgical treatment of bleb dysesthesia after filtering procedure were included in review. Results. Four eyes were included consecutively in the study in a period of 4 years. On average, they developed circumferential bleb dysesthesia 9.3 ± 4.7 months after uneventful combined phacotrabeculectomy with Mitomycin C as primary procedure. Surgical reduction was decided after failure of lubricants in controlling ocular discomfort. Two cases showed a dense fibrous tissue beneath the conjunctiva that was excised to ensure filtration. In all cases, a rapid disappearance of symptoms with very good aesthetic and functional outcome was observed. After 12-month follow-up, patients remained asymptomatic and maintained intraocular pressure of 10.7 ± 1.2 mmHg without treatment. A systematic review of the literature obtained 15 eligible case series (n = 123) with rates of success within 46–100%, favoring less aggressive approaches to reduce bleb size. Conclusion. Bleb dysesthesia is a rare complication of filtering glaucoma surgery. This modified bleb-limiting conjunctivoplasty technique (with removal of subjacent fibrous tissue if present) is able to target the underlying etiology providing ocular discomfort relief while maintaining bleb function and may be considered as first-choice surgical treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Software maintainability is a crucial property of software projects. It can be defined as the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to be corrected, improved, or adapted to its environment. The software engineering literature proposes many models and metrics to predict the maintainability of a software project statically. However, there is no common accordance with the most dependable metrics or metric suites to evaluate such nonfunctional property. The goals of the present manuscript are as follows: (i) providing an overview of the most popular maintainability metrics according to the related literature; (ii) finding what tools are available to evaluate software maintainability; and (iii) linking the most popular metrics with the available tools and the most common programming languages. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review, following Kitchenham’s SLR guidelines, on the most relevant scientific digital libraries. The SLR outcome provided us with 174 software metrics, among which we identified a set of 15 most commonly mentioned ones, and 19 metric computation tools available to practitioners. We found optimal sets of at most five tools to cover all the most commonly mentioned metrics. The results also highlight missing tool coverage for some metrics on commonly used programming languages and minimal coverage of metrics for newer or less popular programming languages. We consider these results valuable for researchers and practitioners who want to find the best selection of tools to evaluate the maintainability of their projects or to bridge the discussed coverage gaps for newer programming languages.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Biliary complications following liver transplant are common. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are the main techniques used to diagnose and treat biliary complications; however, these techniques have limits to the depth of visualization. In this report, we present five cases of orthotopic liver transplant patients with biliary complications that underwent ERCP- or MRCP-guided cholangioscopy with the SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System (SDDVS). The SDDVS allowed for the visualization of the morphological characteristics of biliary strictures, and images collected using the SDDVS allowed for four of the cases to be treated endoscopically. Our findings suggest that cholangioscopy with the SDDVS is a promising method to guide the endoscopic treatment of biliary complications after liver transplantation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Shallow water flow is a geohazard encountered in deepwater drilling. It is often characterized by excessive water flow into the wellbore caused by the pressure difference between overpressured sediments and the wellbore, and it usually leads to serious well control problems and may eventually result in the loss of a well. Many research efforts focused on the identification of shallow water flow zones and the associated water flow in the drilled wellbore. Not many studies investigated the coupled hydromechanical behaviors in sediments during the occurrence of shallow water flow, while such behaviors are directly related to uncontrolled flow in the wellbore and solid deformation. Based on a coupled hydraulic-mechanical model and finite element methods, this work investigates the temporal-spatial evolutions of near-well pressure and stress induced by shallow water flow. Hydraulic behaviors in the deepwater shallow sediments are described by saturated fluid flow in porous media while mechanical behaviors in the sediments are depicted by linear elasticity. Finite element methods are used for the numerical solution to the coupled hydraulic-mechanical formulation. The study then conducts a series of parametric studies to quantitatively understand the effects of relevant parameters on pressure, stress, and uncontrolled flow into the wellbore. Results indicate that overpressure has the most significant impact while Young’s modulus has the most limited impact on spatial-temporal pressure/stress evolutions and the uncontrolled water production in the wellbore. Permeability, porosity, water viscosity, and water compressibility all have certain effects on near-well physical characteristics and wellbore water production. In addition, it is noted that pressure drainage and induced stress are more significant when it is closer to the wellbore. This numerical study helps to quantitatively identify the most influential parameters related to shallow water flow and calculates the water mass flow loaded in the wellbore.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Anzhen Bridge Station of Beijing metro line 12, which adopts a separated-island platform constructed by the undermining method, passes along the retaining wall of the North Third Ring Road. A numerical simulation method is adopted to study the deformation laws of the retaining wall under the influence of station construction. The simulation data show that the affected retaining wall will have large settlement and tilt, and countermeasures must be taken. Four countermeasures are formulated, and their control effects are analyzed. The calculation results show that the combination of anchor cables and waist beams can effectively control the tilt of the retaining wall, but the control effect on the absolute settlement is not obvious. The control effect of isolation piles is better than that of foundation grouting. The joint control method of anchor cables combined with waist beams, isolation piles, and deep hole grouting makes the deformation meet the target, and according to this measure, a concept of joint control aiming at the influence of the “source,” “propagation,” and “object” is proposed, which can provide a reference for similar projects with a great difficulty in deformation control.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The features of the pores in pervious concrete have a great influence on the mechanical property of the pervious concrete. In this study, a finite element model (FEM) with random pores has been used to simulate the mechanical characteristics of pervious concrete. First, pervious concrete specimens with two different porosities were prepared in the laboratory. Then, the specimens were cut and the pores features were extracted based on the images of cross-sections. Thereafter, the ellipse and roundness were introduced into a simulation model to describe the characteristics of pores including the size, area, shape, and inclined angle which have been developed randomly in the FEM using the Monte Carlo method. In the simulation model, the aggregate and cement paste have been simplified into a composite material, and the method of determining the composite modulus of aggregate-cement paste is discussed. The simulation results show that the shape and distribution of the pores have an obvious influence on the internal stress of the pervious concrete and the pore features can be considered reasonable for the validity of the simulations. In addition, the composite modulus of the aggregate-cement paste can be determined by comparing the simulation and test results. The recommended composite modulus in the pervious concrete simulation model is much lower than that of common impervious concrete.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The optical constants of a liquid hydrocarbon such as liquid n-octane are basic material properties that may be used to evaluate their thermal radiation transfer capabilities. In this study, the ellipsometry method was used to measure the optical constants of liquid n-octane in the midinfrared wavelength range of 2.0–16.0 μm at temperatures of 20, 50, and 80°C. Experimental analyses indicate the significant effect of temperature on the refractive index, although it has little effect on the absorption index. With increasing temperature, the refractive index shows a linear decrease, and reduced density leads to weaker absorption intensities. The radiative properties of n-octane droplets, including the absorption and scattering efficiency factors of single droplets with droplet radii r = 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm and the absorption and scattering coefficients in a droplets-air system of droplet volume fractions fv = 2%, 3%, and 4%, were calculated using Mie theory. The numerical results indicate that, with increasing temperature, the absorption efficiency factor slightly decreases, and the variation trend of the scattering efficiency factor is more complicated. With increasing droplet radius, the absorption efficiency factor increases within the studied wavelength range, except for certain absorption peaks, but the scattering efficiency factor tends to decrease. While the absorption is greater, the scattering is weaker for a given droplet radius. With an increasing volume fraction of n-octane droplets, the absorption and scattering coefficients increase linearly within the studied wavelength range.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Lin Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to investigate the intrinsic relationship between residence choice and urban rail transit, this paper establishes a housing valuation model, explores the interface link between the rail transit and other transport modes by the establishment of a model, and also obtains the family transportation impedance. According to the balanced housing price, the various districts’ hedonic cost, and the generalized transportation impedance, the attractiveness of the various districts with respect to each mobile home is obtained. Satisfaction of any resident is received by establishing a close degree model. Due to the satisfaction and the price, we construct a largest consumer surplus model and then obtain the residence of the greatest consumer surplus for mobile home. Numerical example’s result indicates that all high-income mobile homes will chose the residence for the commute destination district, especially the one in the suburbs. Furthermore, the low-income families chose the residence for the commute destination district, which has the rail transit if the income is allowed, or the nearest district to the destination with rail transportation if not. This illustrates that whether a road having urban rail transit plays a significant impact only on the low-income family residence choice when the commuter routes pass through the road and almost has no influence for other families. Hence, it is shown that the reasonable urban planning is important and that urban rail transit should form a network that will play a key role.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypertension constitute a self-perpetuating vicious circle to exacerbate hypertension and subsequent hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. NADPH oxidase (Nox) 1/4 inhibitor GKT137831 alleviates hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in models of secondary hypertension; however, it remains unclear about its effect on hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in models of essential hypertension. This study is aimed at determining the beneficial role of GKT137831 in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and its mechanisms of action. Treating with GKT137831 prevented cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs. Likewise, decreasing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with GKT137831 reduced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity in the left ventricle of SHRs. Additionally, EGFR inhibition also reduced ROS production in the left ventricle and blunted hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs. Moreover, inhibition of the ROS-EGFR pathway with Nox1/4 inhibitor GKT137831 or selective EGFR inhibitor AG1478 reduced protein and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), as well as the activities of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in the left ventricle of SHRs. In summary, GKT137831 prevents hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs, Nox-deprived ROS regulated EGFR activation through positive feedback in the hypertrophic myocardium, and inhibition of the ROS-EGFR pathway mediates the protective role of GKT137831 in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy via repressing cardiac inflammation and activation of Akt and ERK1/2. This research will provide additional details for GKT137831 to prevent hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Qingxin kaiqiao fang (QKF), a traditional Chinese medicine compound, has been applied to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD) for many years and has exhibited remarkable effects. However, the underlying mechanism is still not explicit. The current study aims to investigate whether QKF exerts an antiapoptotic role through the p38 MAPK pathway in the course of AD. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to study the effective components, possible therapeutic targets, and AD-related pathway of QKF. Further, the AD cell model was established using amyloid-beta (Aβ)25-35 peptide and primary hippocampal neuronal cells extracted from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats. Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) imaging was used to detect the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Western blot (WB) analysis was applied to detect the protein expression levels of p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively. SB203580 and U46619 were used to detect changes in cell morphology, cell viability, and apoptosis upon inhibiting or activating p38 MAPK. Our present work showed that QKF protects hippocampal neuronal morphology, enhances cell viability, and reduces the number of TUNEL-positive cells. In addition, our results showed that QKF increased the expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins and decreased the expression of proapoptotic proteins. QKF at 25 mg·mL−1 best inhibited neuronal apoptosis among the three doses of QKF by suppressing p38 MAPK activity. Collectively, QKF plays an antiapoptotic role via the p38 MAPK pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Dengue is an acute febrile illness caused by positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus. Transmission of virus among the individuals occurred by blood-feeding Aedes mosquitoes. This virus has four serotypes differentiated on the basis of antibody neutralization assay. At present, there is no particular treatment or vaccine candidate available for dengue infection. Approximately 3.9 billion human populations are at risk of dengue virus (DENV) infection. Thus, precise diagnosis of dengue at the early stage is very essential for disease control and effective therapy in order to treat or prevent severe complications. Indeed, the accurate diagnosis of DENV remains a problem because of low detection accuracy along with high testing price. Sensitivity and specificity of available kits vary from test to test, and cross-reactivity with other Flavivirus is a challenging issue for diagnosis. In this study, linear epitopes of envelope (E) and NS1 proteins were identified to diagnose the DENV. Whole protein sequences of E and NS1 of DENV were obtained from UniProtKB database. On the basis of algorithm prediction from DNASTAR, BCEPRED, and IEDB data resources, twelve peptides of E (EP1 to EP12) and eight peptides of NS1 (NS1-1 to NS1-8) were selected, which were common in all serotypes. Sequence homologies of peptides with other Flavivirus were checked by Multiple Sequence Alignment Tool ClustalX2. Peptide sequences were synthesized chemically by solid-phase peptide synthesis technique. Dengue-specific IgM and IgG (secondary response) antibodies in the patient’s antisera were tested with the peptides using ELISA protocol. Peptides EP1, EP2, EP4, EP7, EP10, and EP12 of E protein and NS1-1, NS1-3, NS1-4, NS1-7, and NS1-8 of NS1 protein were considered the best immunoreactive peptides with the sensitivity (73.33-96.66%) and specificity (82.14-100%). Such peptides together can be used to construct the multiple antigen peptides (MAP) or multiplexed microbeads for designing a precise, cost-effective, and easy-to-make peptide-based immunodiagnostic kit for DENV detection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, a new starch has been isolated from acorn (Quercus ilex) fruits. The chemical composition of acorn flour showed its richness in carbohydrates (64.43%), proteins (8%), and fat (10%). The extraction yield of acorn starch was about 34.5%. Thus, the composition of extracted acorn starch and its physical and functional properties were studied. Acorn starch had high purity represented by low proportions of proteins (0.92%) and lipids (0.51%) with a pH of 5.3. The swelling power was 20.76 g/g, while the solubility was about 64.22% at 90°C which suggests that acorn starch has potential for use in food industries. The FT-IR spectra of isolated native starches have shown the main bands characterizing the starch. However, X-ray diffractograms exhibited an A- and B-type diffraction pattern. Furthermore, the effect of acorn starch incorporation at different levels (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) on the quality parameters of a fermented dairy product was investigated at the beginning of storage. The results demonstrated that the most suitable dose of acorn starch to be incorporated in the fermented dairy product was lower than 1%. This low concentration reduced syneresis, improved functional properties, and enhanced the viscosity of the fermented dairy product.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The article describes a rare case of radicular cyst associated with deciduous right upper molars in a 5 y.o. male patient. The cyst developed asymptomatically in the maxillary sinus, thus causing considerable displacement of both premolar germs. Due to the severity of surgery, the patient was treated under general anesthesia in a one-day surgery system with use of the enucleation method. The extent of the lesion results in necessity of removal of the second premolar germ. Early diagnosis of the lesion would have resulted in a more conservative treatment plan. The purpose of this article is to lay emphasis on the pedodontist’s role in early diagnosis of such lesions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have completely changed the treatment of cancer, and they also can cause multiple organ immune-related adverse reactions (irAEs). Among them, rheumatic irAE is less common, mainly including inflammatory arthritis, rheumatic myalgia/giant cell arteritis, inflammatory myopathy, and Sjogren’s syndrome. For oncologists, rheumatism is a relatively new field, and early diagnosis and treatment is very important, and we need to work closely with experienced rheumatologists. In this review, we focused on the incidence, clinical characteristics, and treatment strategies of rheumatic irAE.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Modern spacecraft are often equipped with large-scale, complex, and lightweight solar arrays whose deployment involves a highly dynamic movement. This paper proposed a novel adaptive proportional-derivative typed fuzzy logic control scheme for the attitude stabilization of a flexible spacecraft during the deployment of a composite laminated solar array. First, a constrained rigid-flexible coupling spacecraft model consisting of a rigid main body and a flexible solar array was proposed. The solar array, which is composed of composite laminated shells, was described by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. Then, the detailed derivation of the adaptive fuzzy PD controller for attitude stabilization of the spacecraft was discussed. In addition, the spacecraft dynamic model which integrated the adaptive fuzzy PD controller was derived as a set of differential-algebraic equations. Several simulations were developed to investigate the solar array deployment dynamics and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive fuzzy PD controller. The results suggested that the proposed dynamic model is able to exactly describe the deployment dynamics of the composite laminated solar array. The solar array deployment causes obvious translational and rotational motions of the spacecraft. The proposed adaptive fuzzy PD control scheme has better performance in terms of the control precision and time response in stabilizing spacecraft during the deployment of the composite laminated solar array, comparing with that of the conventional PD controller.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Asthma and diabetes are both diseases that affect a wide range of people worldwide. As a common treatment for diabetes, metformin has also been reported to be effective in improving asthma outcomes. We conducted a combined analysis to examine the efficacy of metformin in reducing asthma exacerbation in patients with concurrent asthma and diabetes. Methods. We searched the PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases for articles published prior to April 2020 to find observational studies of individuals with concurrent asthma and diabetes that compared the risk of asthma exacerbation between metformin users and nonusers. Two researchers separately screened the studies, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. The primary outcome was the adjusted risk of asthma exacerbation. The secondary outcomes were the adjusted risk of asthma-related hospitalization and emergency room visits. Review Manager was used for data analysis and plotting. I2 and χ2 tests were used to estimate heterogeneity. A random effects or fixed effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity. Odds ratios were calculated for dichotomous variables. Results. We included two studies with a total of 25252 patients. The pooled effect size showed that metformin was inversely associated with a risk of asthma exacerbation (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.28–1.48; χ2 = 5.42, P=0.02; I2 = 82%), asthma-related emergency department visits (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.89; χ2 = 0.36, P=0.55; I2 = 0%), and hospitalizations (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.14–1.29; χ2 = 4.01, P=0.05; I2 = 75%). Conclusion. This meta-analysis suggested that metformin decreased the risk of asthma-related emergency room visits for patients with concurrent asthma and diabetes. Metformin reduced the risk of asthma-related hospitalization and exacerbation but was not statistically significant. More randomized trials involving larger samples should be considered, and the mechanisms of these effects need to be fully elucidated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a collective term for a group of inflammatory conditions of uncertain origin, which causes chronic arthritis in one or more joints. The clinical course of JIA is characterised by episodes of increased activity, termed flares. Vaccinations have previously been proposed as a “trigger” for some flares, although evidence supporting this is scant. Objective. To explore whether routine childhood vaccinations are associated with an increased risk of flares of arthritis activity in children with JIA. Methods. Patients aged below 6 years with a diagnosis of JIA were recruited from the Rheumatology Clinical Database at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, from 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2016. Patient immunisation status was cross-checked with the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The self-controlled case series methodology (Rowhani-Rahbar et al., 2012) was applied to determine whether the risk of arthritis flares in the three months following immunisation was greater than the baseline risk for each patient. Results. 138 patients were included in the study. 32 arthritis flares occurred in the 90 days following immunisation. The risk of arthritis flares during the 90 days following immunisation was reduced compared with patients’ baseline risk (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.89, p=0.012)). Conclusion. Routine childhood immunisations were not associated with arthritis flare onset in patients with JIA. The risk of arthritis flares in the 90 days following vaccination was lower than the baseline risk. In the context of COVID19, vaccination will not increase interaction with the healthcare system beyond the immunisation encounter.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Massive ascites as a presentation of endometriosis is a rare clinical entity that is most commonly seen in black nulliparous females. Herein, we describe a case of a 32-year-old multiparous Thai woman who presented with a two-year history of abdominal distension. Computerized tomography of the abdominopelvic region showed an infiltrative enhancing lesion involving the cul-de-sac and perirectal region with massive loculated ascites, suggesting carcinomatosis peritonei. Abdominal paracentesis was performed to yield fluid samples for evaluation, which revealed no malignant cells, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for tuberculosis. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed a large amount of serosanguinous ascites, thickened matted bowel loops, and necrotic debris covering the entire surface of the peritoneum and visceral organs. The surgical procedures included drainage of 6.5 liters of ascites, lysis adhesion, biopsy of the peritoneum, and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Histologic examination revealed benign endometrial glands with stroma at the peritoneum tissue and broad ligament. Other causes of ascites were excluded. The ascites responded to drainage and hormonal suppression. A final diagnosis of endometriosis was made based on these findings. Endometriosis should therefore be considered in differential diagnosis in women of childbearing age who present with ascites.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The convergence of TB and HIV dual epidemics is a major public health challenge in Ghana as well as many developing countries. Treatment outcome monitoring is a vital part of the surveillance needed to successfully eliminate TB. The impact of HIV status and demographic and treatment-related factors on adverse TB treatment outcome has not been studied in the Greater Accra Regional Hospital. This study determined factors associated with TB treatment outcome in patients with TB-HIV coinfection and TB-only infection in the hospital. Method. A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Greater Accra Regional Hospital. We reviewed TB treatment cards of patients who received treatment for tuberculosis in the hospital from 2008 to 2016. Data on treatment outcome and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were extracted on TB-only-infected and TB/HIV-coinfected patients. The chi-squared test and binary and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with adverse treatment outcome. Results. Out of the 758 patient records analyzed, 174 (22.9%) were TB-HIV-coinfected patients. Overall treatment success for all TB patients was 88.1% (668/758). About 11.9% (90/758) of the patients had an adverse treatment outcome, including treatment failure 0.9% (7/758), defaulting 0.9% (7/758), and death 10.0% (76/758). TB-HIV-coinfected patients’ treatment success was 78.1% (136/174). TB-only patients’ treatment success was 91.4% (532/582). Independent predictors of adverse treatment outcome were found to be as follows: being HIV positive (aOR: 3.85, 95% CI: 2.19-6.75; p&lt;0.01); aged 65 and above (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.44-1.54; p=0.01); and previously failed TB treatment (aOR: 5.02, 95% CI: 2.09-28.87; p&lt;0.01). Conclusion. Treatment outcome for TB-HIV-coinfected patients is below the WHO target. HIV status, age, and category of patient of the TB patients were associated with adverse treatment outcome. Strengthening the TB/HIV collaborative efforts by stakeholders is required for good treatment outcomes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Particle size is an important factor affecting the Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical (THM) coupling behavior of graveled rock mass, especially for the shear mechanical properties. In this study, three groups of the particle size range and nine particle grading samples are designed for a large-scale direct shear test. The relationships between shear stress and shear displacement, shear strength, stress ratio, shear strength parameters, and particle breakage of pebble gravel are analyzed. The influence of particle size range and grade on the strength and particle breakage of gravel material is discussed. Results show evident particle breakage in the process of direct shear, and the degree of fragmentation is controlled by the normal load and the particle size distribution of the sample. The shear strength of the sample is no longer applicable to Mohr-Coulomb strength theory because of particle breakage that is more in line with the power function relationship. Shear strength of pebble gravel material has scale effect, and a corresponding relationship model between friction coefficient f of material and characteristic particle size of the sample is proposed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has revolutionized the field of immunooncology. Despite the relative success, the response rate to anti-PD-1 therapy requires further improvements. Our aim was to explore the enhancement of T-cell function by using novel PD-1-blocking proteins and compare with clinically approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We isolated T-cells from the ascites and tumor of 17 patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and analyzed the effects using the mAbs nivolumab and pembrolizumab and two novel engineered ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPin® proteins). PD-1 blockade with either mAb or DARPin® molecule significantly increased the release of IFN-γ, granzyme B, IL-2, and TNF-α, demonstrating successful reinvigoration. The monovalent DARPin® protein was less effective compared to its bivalent equivalent, demonstrating that bivalency brings an additional benefit to PD-1 blockade. Overall, we found a higher fold increase of lymphokine secretion in response to the PD-1 blockade by tumor-derived T-cells; however, the absolute amounts were significantly lower compared to the release from ascites-derived T-cells. Our results demonstrate that PD-1 blockade can only partially reinvigorate functionally suppressed T-cells from EOC patients. This warrants further investigation preferably in combination with other therapeutics. The study provides an early pilot proof-of-concept for the potential use of DARPin® proteins as eligible alternative scaffold proteins to block PD-1.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A spaceborne cryogenic cooler induces undesirable microvibration disturbances during its on-orbit operation, which is one of the main sources that degrades the image quality of submeter-level high-resolution observation satellites. Several types of vibration isolation systems based on passive approaches have been developed for reducing the microvibration of the cooler. A coil-spring-type passive vibration isolation system developed in a previous study has shown excellent performance in both launch vibration and on-orbit microvibration isolation. To improve the capability of the conventional cooler isolator, including the position sensitivity and launch vibration reduction, we propose a new version of a dual coil-spring-type passive vibration isolator system. The effectiveness of the newly proposed design was validated through a microjitter measurement test, position sensitivity test, and qualification-level launch vibration test of the isolator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic peptide known to cause hyperphagia, has been involved in the occurrence and development of obesity. However, differences in the distribution of serum NPY levels in obese phenotypes (including metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) phenotype and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) phenotype) and the association of NPY with MUO phenotype have not been unequivocally established. We therefore determined associations of serum NPY levels with MUO phenotype in obese Chinese adults. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 400 obese adults in Hunan province, who underwent a health examination in the Second Xiangya Hospital, and 164 participants were finally enrolled in the study and divided into MHO and MUO groups. Serum NPY levels were examined; univariate and multivariate analyses as well as smooth curve fitting analyses were conducted to measure the association of NPY serum levels with the MUO phenotype. Results. Serum NPY levels were significantly elevated in the MUO group compared with the MHO group ((667.69±292.90) pg/mL vs. (478.89±145.53) pg/mL, p&lt;0.001). A threshold and nonlinear association between serum NPY levels and MUO was found (p=0.001). When serum NPY levels exceeded the turning point (471.5 pg/mL), each 10 pg/mL increment in the NPY serum level was significantly associated with an 18% increased odds ratio of MUO phenotype (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.29, p=0.0007) after adjusted for confounders. Conclusions. Higher NPY serum levels were positively correlated with MUO phenotype in obese Chinese adults.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The mechanisms that link obesity and cancer development are not well-defined. Investigation of leptin and leptin receptor expressions may help define some of the mechanisms. These proteins are known for associating with the immune response, angiogenesis and, signalling pathways such as JAK2/STAT3, PI3K, and AKT pathways. Tissue proteins can be easily detected with immunohistochemistry (IHC), a technique widely used both in diagnostic and research laboratories. The identification of altered levels of leptin and leptin receptor proteins in tumour tissues may lead to targeted treatment for cancer. Objective. The objective of this study was to use IHC to compare leptin and leptin receptor expressions in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) in non-obese and obese patients to determine the association between these proteins with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of ccRCC. Patients and Methods. The study involved 60 patients who underwent nephrectomy of which 34 were obese, as assessed using body mass index (BMI). Nephrectomy samples provided tissues of ccRCC and adjacent non-cancerous kidney. The intensity and localization of leptin and leptin receptor protein expressions were evaluated using IHC and correlated with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes. Aperio ImageScope morphometry and digital pathology were applied to assess the IHC results. The chi-square test was used to determine if there was any significant association between the proteins and the clinicopathological features. The Kaplan-Meier test was used to determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results. There was neither significant difference in the overall cellular and nuclear expressions of leptin and leptin receptor between non-cancerous kidney and ccRCC tissues nor in non-obese and obese individuals with ccRCC. Conclusion. In this present study, it was revealed that leptin and leptin receptor were not associated with tumour characteristics and progression of ccRCC patients. Interestingly, nuclear expression of leptin was significantly associated with overall survival. However, the significance of these proteins as biomarkers in other RCC histotypes is still unclear.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To evaluate the impact of long-term Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation combined with antiviral therapy with Nucleos (t) ide analogues (NAs) on the incidence of cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods. This retrospective cohort study included 521 patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent a treatment course of ≥3 years from 1998–2019. Of the 521 patients, 261 were defined as TCM users while 260 were TCM nonusers (control group). All the enrolled subjects were followed up until February 2019 to measure the incidence and hazard ratio (HR) of cirrhosis, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the independent factors affecting the occurrence of cirrhosis. Results. The cumulative incidence of TCM users and nonusers was 6.9% and 13.5%, respectively (P=0.013). Results of the Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that TCM users had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cirrhosis than TCM nonusers (P=0.011), and TCM users had a significantly lower liver cirrhosis risk than TCM nonusers (adjusted HR = 0.416, 95% CI, 0.231–0.749). The histological evaluation revealed improved fibrosis in 45.0% of TCM users and 11.1% of TCM nonusers (P=0.033). The analysation of the prescriptions including total 119 single Chinese herbs medicinal demonstrated that “replenish qi and fortify the spleen,” “clear heat and dispel dampness,” and “soothe the liver and regulate qi” are the main treatment methods of TCM for CHB. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that long-term TCM use may attenuate liver cirrhosis risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious condition that results in disability and has a high morbidity rate; its treatment is very difficult. Although troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate (TCH) injections have been extensively used in clinics in China for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral stroke, the potential efficacy of TCH injection in the treatment of SCI has never been revealed. In this study, the effects of administering TCH injections on neurological recovery in post-SCI rats were first tested with regard to the behavior and histology; subsequently, the specific expression profile of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) in their spinal cords were conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The LncRNA-mRNA networks were also elucidated. After SCI, we found that TCH injection with the right dose is effective for the recovery of locomotion function and repairing of the damaged tissue in the spinal cord; TCH injection is also discovered to have a role in the regulation of 443 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed LncRNAs (DELs) that are identified to have multiple functions, including locomotion, blood vessel morphogenesis, thiamine metabolism, Hippo signaling pathway, and axon guidance, by applying the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. In addition, it is revealed that, after SCI, the highly expressed LncRNA AABR07071383.1 in the post-SCI cis/trans-regulates the expression of mRNA Acpp mRNA that encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolic process of thiamine in the abirritation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which implies that TCH injection may be more effective when administered with benfotiamine (a common treatment drug).</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the best representative of the current cutting-edge technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is widely used in various fields such as electric power inspection, agriculture, forestry and plant protection, fire rescue, and film and television shooting. With the rapid development of UAV, the safety work of UAV has become more important. In order to improve the safety of hexarotor UAV during flight, a fault-tolerant control scheme independent of basic control law and control distribution is designed in this paper. Firstly, the linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) was used as the basic control law for attitude control of hexarotor UAV. Secondly, in the case of actuator failure of hexarotor UAV, a fault observer was used to estimate fault information accurately. Then, on this basis, the control distribution matrix was adjusted to reduce the use of the faulty motor, and the purpose of fault-tolerant control was achieved. Finally, simulation experiments and actual flight experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the robustness of the control system and the flight safety of UAV.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The rate of neuronal apoptosis increases after spinal cord injury (SCI). Anastomosing the normal nerve roots above the SCI level to the injured sacral nerve roots can enhance the functional recovery of neurons. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of sacral nerve root transfer after SCI on pontine neuronal survival. Methods. Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: Group A, reconstruction of afferent and efferent nerve pathways of the bladder after SCI; Group B, SCI only; and Group C, control group. We examined pontine neuronal morphology using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining after SCI and nerve transfer. Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression changes in the pontine micturition center were quantified by immunohistochemistry. The number of apoptotic neurons was determined by TUNEL staining. We examined pontine neuronal apoptosis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at different time points. Results. H&amp;E staining demonstrated that the number of neurons had increased in Group A, but more cells in Group B displayed nuclear pyknosis, with the disappearance of the nucleus. Compared with Group B, Group A had significantly higher Bcl-2 expression, significantly lower Bax expression, and a significantly higher Bcl-2/Bax ratio. The number of apoptotic neurons and neuron bodies in Group A was significantly lower than that in Group B, as indicated by TUNEL staining and TEM. Conclusions. These findings demonstrate that lumbosacral nerve transfer can reduce neuronal apoptosis in the pontine micturition center and enhance functional recovery of neurons. This result further suggests that lumbosacral nerve transfer can be used as a new approach for reconstructing bladder function after spinal cord injury.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Pulsatile tinnitus is a relatively common presentation in otolaryngology clinics, most cases of which have a treatable cause. This presentation warrants a thorough workup to identify treatable, and rule out life-threatening, etiologies. We present a case of a patient with pulsatile tinnitus arising from multiple dilated venous channels in the head and neck. Case Presentation. We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female with a two-year history of progressive, bilateral pulsatile tinnitus, which had become debilitating. Computed-tomographic angiography (CTA) studies ruled out an intracranial vascular cause for her symptoms. However, computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple dilated bilateral, low-flow, venous channels throughout the head and neck. The proximity of such dilated venous channels to the temporal bone provides a route for sound to be transmitted to the inner ear. Conclusion. Arterial, venous, and systemic etiologies can cause pulsatile tinnitus. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the head and neck represent less than 1% of cases. In our patient, dilated low-flow venous malformations are the likely source of her symptoms, which is the first reported case in the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Intracellular reactive apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in ultraviolet- (UV-) induced inflammation and aging reaction in human dermal tissues. This study determines the mechanism by which Haematococcus pluvialis extracts (HPE) and purified astaxanthin (HPA) to promote skin regeneration in the injured tissue in vitro and in vivo. The results show that HPE and HPA decrease the DNA damage and promote the secretion of collagen from the human normal fibroblast cell line (Hs68) in a dose-dependent manner. UV irradiation and HPA reduce oxidative stress damage due to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). When skin cells are injured by free radicals, cells undergo a programmed cellular death. Cellular apoptotic death is determined using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining to verify that there is no cell membrane asymmetry and that the nuclear membrane is broken. Inflammatory symptoms and apoptotic injuries to experimental rats in a group that is treated with HPA treated are decreased in a dose-dependent manner after UVB exposure (300 mJ/cm2) for 15 min in vivo, compared to the vehicle control group. These positive results show that HPA repairs UVB-triggered skin tissue injury and aging by conducting electrons out of cells to maintain a low level of oxidative stress so that collagen is synthesized in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Oxidative stress appears to be responsible for the gradual dysfunction that manifests via numerous cellular pathways throughout PD progression. This review will describe the prooxidant effect of excessive consumption of processed food. Processed meat can affect health due to its high sodium content, advanced lipid oxidation end-products, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. During cooking, lipids can react with proteins to form advanced end-products of lipid oxidation. Excessive consumption of different types of carbohydrates is a risk factor for PD. The antioxidant effects of some foods in the regular diet provide an inconclusive interpretation of the environment’s mechanisms with the modulation of oxidation stress-induced PD. Some antioxidant molecules are known whose primary mechanism is the neuroprotective effect. The melatonin mechanism consists of neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing antioxidant enzyme’s expression and activity. N-acetylcysteine protects against the development of PD by restoring levels of brain glutathione. The balanced administration of vitamin B3, ascorbic acid, vitamin D and the intake of caffeine every day seem beneficial for brain health in PD. Excessive chocolate intake could have adverse effects in PD patients. The findings reported to date do not provide clear benefits for a possible efficient therapeutic intervention by consuming the nutrients that are consumed regularly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Liver transplantation induces self-injury and affects remote organs, such as the lung, kidney, and intestine. Postoperative intestinal dysfunction has been associated with prolonged hospitalization and affects a patient’s health and quality of life. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been proven effective in multiple organ protection. However, the potential mechanism underlying the protective effects of EA on intestinal injury after liver transplantation remains unclear. Methods. After establishing an autogenous orthotopic liver transplantation (AOLT) model, we studied the effects of EA pretreatment on intestinal injury after AOLT. We used the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 to explore the underlying mechanism. Histological analysis and apoptosis assays were used to evaluate intestinal injury. Oxidative stress index and inflammatory response were also measured after AOLT. Furthermore, we detected the phosphorylation levels of JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 by Western blot. Results. We found that pretreatment with EA alleviated intestinal injury after AOLT, as shown by HE staining and TUNEL methods. EA pretreatment inhibited the expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT1, and p-STAT3 in the intestines after AOLT. Upon treatment with JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490, intestinal injury was balanced. Conclusion. The data indicated EA pretreatment alleviated intestinal injury after AOLT by inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These results provide basic evidence to support the potential therapeutic efficacy of EA.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hadi Bagheri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Roasting is a key process in production of nuts. Improving the flavor and crispiness of texture in nuts is considered as a purpose of roasting, which increases the overall acceptance of the product. This review aims to introduce the infrared method as a new technique of roasting and evaluate the quality characteristics of some nuts after infrared roasting. Usually, the traditional roasting methods are time-consuming with high energy consumption and low production efficiency. One of the best ways to decrease roasting time and energy consumption is to provide heat by infrared (IR) radiation. However, the low penetration power of infrared radiation is one of the limitations of this method. The combination of infrared with other thermal methods can overcome this limitation. Studies have been done on roasting of nuts and other foods by different IR roasting methods such as IR, IR-hot air, and IR-microwave roasting methods. This paper reviews the effect of different IR roasting methods on the quality characteristics of roasted pistachio, peanut, hazelnut, almond, sunflower, soybean, and other food products. IR heating has been applied successfully to the roasting of some nuts. The use of infrared roasting has several advantages in comparison with traditional convective roasting methods. According to the results of most of these studies, the combination of infrared with other thermal methods to roast nuts has distinctly improved the potential of the technology as compared to the IR roasting alone.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Although the incidence and mortality of complicated skin and soft tissue infections have decreased, this infection is still relatively frequent and can be associated with lethal complications. In this study, the authors present our clinical experience of patients with complicated posterior cervical skin and soft tissue infections (CPCSSTIs) diagnosed and treated in a reconstructive unit in northeastern China. Methods. A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with CPCSSTIs from January 2009 to December 2018 was performed. To make the results objective and convincing, a data analysis was performed relating to demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, predisposing factor, bacterial culture, laboratory and radiographic evaluations, diagnostic clues, management, and complications as well as the clinical course and outcome. Results. During the ten-year period, there were 174 consecutive patients admitted to our reconstructive center with final diagnosis of CPCSSTIs included. All the patients were adults, and the majority were male (67.2%). The patient’s mean age was 51.3 years (range, 15-88 years). There were 114 patients (65.5%) that had associated systemic diseases, with diabetes mellitus (40.2%) as the most common predisposing factor. Common presented clinical symptoms were pain (90.8%), swelling (85.1%), and erythema (77%) of the neck. Surgical treatment was performed in all the patients, and most of them (83.9%) received the first surgery within 24 h. The most commonly isolated pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (30%). Vancomycin (21.3%) was the most commonly used antibiotics, followed by cefepime (18.4%). All the patients survived and were discharged with a mean duration of hospitalization of 28.7 days. Those patients with predisposing factors (31.4±12.35 days) or complications (41.0±12.5 days) tended to have a longer hospital stay. The mean total costs of admission per patient were 47 644 RMB. Conclusion. This study highlights the high cost burden of CPCSSTI patients. Those patients with predisposing factors or complications tended to have a longer hospital stay.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) has been shown to benefit osteoarthritic patients by reducing pain and supporting tissue regeneration through a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-related paracrine mechanism. This observational study of 110 knees assessed patient-centered outcomes of pain, functionality, and quality of life, analyzing their variation at twelve months following one ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection of autologous MFAT for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Method. Inclusion criteria were as follows: VAS &gt;50, and the presence of KOA as diagnosed on X-ray and MRI. Exclusion criteria included the following: recent injury (&lt;3 months) of the symptomatic knee, intra-articular steroid injections performed within the last three months, and hyaluronic acid injections prior to this treatment. Changes in VAS, OKS, and EQ-5D were scored at baseline and twelve months following a single intra-articular injection of autologous MFAT. Score variation was analyzed utilizing a nonparametric paired samples Wilcoxon test. The statistical analysis is reproducible with Open Access statistical software R (version 4.0.0 or higher). The study was carried out with full patient consent, in a private practice setting. Results. Median VAS (pain) improved from 70 (IQR 20) to 30 (IQR 58) (p&lt;0.001); median OKS (function) improved from 25 (IQR 11) to 33.5 (IQR 16) (p&lt;0.001); and median EQ-5D (quality of life) improved from 0.62 (IQR 0.41) to 0.69 (IQR 0.28) (p&lt;0.001). No adverse events were reported during the intraoperative, recovery, or postoperative periods. Conclusions. For patients with all grades of knee osteoarthritis who were treated with intra-articular injections of MFAT, statistically significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life were reported. Although further research is warranted, the results are encouraging and suggest a positive role for intra-articular injection of MFAT as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Increasing evidence has shown competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) play key roles in numerous cancers. Nevertheless, the ceRNA network that can predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still lacking. The aim of the present study was to identify the prognostic value of key ceRNAs in lung tumorigenesis. Differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were identified between LUAD and adjacent normal samples by limma package in R using The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway function enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package in R. Subsequently, the LUAD ceRNA network was established in three steps based on ceRNA hypothesis. Hub RNAs were identified using degree analysis methods based on Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was implemented to calculate the risk score using the candidate ceRNAs and overall survival information. The survival differences between the high-risk and low-risk ceRNA groups were determined by the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test using survival and survminer package in R. A total of 2,989 mRNAs, 185 lncRNAs, and 153 miRNAs were identified. GO and KEGG pathway function enrichment analysis showed that DE mRNAs were mainly associated with “sister chromatid segregation,” “regulation of angiogenesis,” “cell adhesion molecules (CAMs),” “cell cycle,” and “ECM-receptor interaction.” LUAD-related ceRNA network was constructed, which comprised of 54 nodes and 78 edges. Top ten hub RNAs (hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-374b-5p, hsa-miR-340-5p, hsa-miR-377-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-326, SNHG1, RALGPS2, and PITX2) were identified according to their degree. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated that hsa-miR-21-5p and RALGPS2 had a significant prognostic value. Finally, we found that a high risk of three novel ceRNA interactions (SNHG1-hsa-miR-21-5p-RALGPS2, SNHG1-hsa-miR-326-RALGPS2, and SNHG1-hsa-miR-377-3p-RALGPS2) was positively associated with worse prognosis. Three novel ceRNAs (SNHG1-hsa-miR-21-5p-RALGPS2, SNHG1-hsa-miR-326-RALGPS2, and SNHG1-hsa-miR-377-3p-RALGPS2) might be potential biomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of LUAD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs) of genes, which are stable qualitative transcriptional characteristics, can provide abundant information for a disease. Methods based on REO comparisons have been proposed for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the individual level and for detecting disease-associated genes based on one-phenotype disease data by reusing data of normal samples from other sources. Here, we evaluated the effects of common potential confounding factors, including age, cigarette smoking, sex, and race, on the REOs of gene pairs within normal lung tissues transcriptome. Our results showed that age has little effect on REOs within lung tissues. We found that about 0.23% of the significantly stable REOs of gene pairs in nonsmokers’ lung tissues are reversed in smokers’ lung tissues, introduced by 344 DEGs between the two groups of samples (RankCompV2, FDR &lt;0.05), which are enriched in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, glutathione metabolism, and other pathways (hypergeometric test, FDR &lt;0.05). Comparison between the normal lung tissue samples of males and females revealed fewer reversal REOs introduced by 24 DEGs between the sex groups, among which 19 DEGs are located on sex chromosomes and 5 DEGs involving in spermatogenesis and regulation of oocyte are located on autosomes. Between the normal lung tissue samples of white and black people, we identified 22 DEGs (RankCompV2, FDR &lt;0.05) which introduced a few reversal REOs between the two races. In summary, the REO-based study should take into account the confounding factors of cigarette smoking, sex, and race.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes a sliding mode control (SMC) strategy to solve the problem of independent control of temperature and humidity in air conditioners; the complexity increases due to the need to make full use of the wind side for cooling. First, dynamics of indoor temperature and humidity are determined based on mathematical models. Second, in order to reduce the chattering effect of SMC and coordinate indoor conditions to satisfy people’s needs, the independent control of temperature and humidity is realized via a novel fuzzy sliding mode control strategy based on reaching laws. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Swati Jain</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Alkesh Jani</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels are characterized by tolerance of severe hypothermia and hypoperfusion during torpor, followed by periodic warm reperfusion during IBA, conditions which are lethal to nonhibernating mammals. The aim of the present study was to determine whether protection from apoptosis was specific to torpor arousal cycles during hibernation or will also apply to cisplatin treatment on squirrel renal tubular cells (RTECs) that were procured during hibernation. Squirrel and mouse RTECs were treated with cisplatin, a potent inducer of RTEC apoptosis. Squirrel RTECs subjected to cisplatin had significantly less apoptosis, no cleaved caspase-3, and increased XIAP, pAkt, and pBAD versus mouse RTECs. To determine whether XIAP and Akt1 are necessary for RTEC protection against cisplatin induced apoptotic cell death, gene expression of Akt1 or XIAP was silenced in squirrel RTECs. Squirrel RTECs deficient in Akt1 and XIAP had increased apoptosis and cleaved caspase-3 when treated with cisplatin. Our results thus demonstrates that 13-lined ground squirrel RTECs possess intrinsic intracellular mechanisms by which they protect themselves from apoptotic cell death. Cisplatin induced acute kidney injury (AKI) may be avoided in cancer patients by employing mechanisms used by squirrel RTECs to protect against cisplatin induced tubular cell apoptosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) represents the most frequent clinical complaint encountered by dermatologists and is characterized by a progressive miniaturization of the hair follicle. However, the efficacy and safety of current medical treatment remain limited, and more personalized therapeutic approaches for AGA are needed. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) in patients with AGA. Methods. 63 patients with AGA meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this study and treated with BTA injection or BTA injection combined with oral finasteride (FNS). In the scalp, 30 sites were injected with 100 U of BTA in each site and patients received BTA after every 3 months for a total of 4 times. Hair counts, head photographs, evaluation scores, and self-assessment were assessed in patients with AGA. Results. Hair counts in both groups at all time points were significantly higher as compared with those before treatment. After 4 times of treatment, hair counts in the BTA+FNS group were higher than those in the BTA group. Hair growth and density were significantly augmented, and the area of hair loss was attenuated after each treatment as revealed by head photographs. The effective rates of BTA and BTA+FNS groups were 73.3% and 84.8%, respectively, following 4 times treatment. Conclusion. BTA is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AGA without adverse effects, and BTA combined with FNS exhibited a superior therapeutic effect than BTA alone.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After-sales service contract is widely popular in business. Although both the cases of manufacturer offering warranty and retailer offering warranty are common in market, the differences between them have been few studied. In this paper, we build a two-echelon supply chain in which a manufacturer produces limit quality products and sells them to a retailer. To promote sales, the manufacturer or retailer offers a free-replacement warranty to the customers. Customer’s demand is affected by the warranty length. We investigate the game relationships between the supply chain members. We find that the warranty length negatively relates to the product quality in both the manufacturer offering warranty case and the retailer offering warranty case. When retailer’s profit margin is not low, the retailer offers a longer warranty than the manufacturer and vice versa. Profit of the supply chain is also analyzed along with a numerical study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Many studies have shown that NLRC4 inflammasome polymorphisms are associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases, but the associations between NLRC4 polymorphisms and autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) are unclear. Our research was aimed at identifying the correlations between NLRC4 polymorphisms and AITDs. Methods. Hi-SNP high-throughput genotyping technology was used for detecting four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NLRC4 in 1005 AITDs patients (including 629 Graves’ disease and 376 Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) and 781 healthy controls. Results. Compared with healthy controls, the allele frequencies and genotype distribution of rs385076 were statistically related to AITDs (P=0.016 and P=0.048, respectively) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (P=0.022 and P=0.046, respectively). Before adjusting for age and gender, rs385076 and AITDs had a significant association in three models of allele model, dominant model, and homozygous model. After adjusting for age and gender, in the above three models, there is still a clear relationship between them. Before adjusting for age and gender, there were prominent discrepancy between rs385076 and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in the allele model (OR=0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97; P=0.021) and the dominant model (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=0.014), after adjusting for age and gender, rs385076 and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis were significantly related to allele model, dominant model, and homozygous model. However, rs455060, rs212704, and rs675712 were not related to AITDs in our study. Conclusion. NLRC4 rs385076 was found to have a significant association with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis for the first time. It laid a foundation for the disclosure of the pathogenesis of AITDs, and provided a possible treatment prospect for HT.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In response to the unbalanced sample categories and complex sample distribution of the operating data of the pitch system of the wind turbine generator system, this paper proposes a method for fault detection of the pitch system of the wind turbine generator system based on the multiclass optimal margin distribution machine. In this method, the power output of the wind turbine generator system is used as the main status parameter, and the operating data history of the wind turbine generator system in the wind power supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is subject to correlation analysis with the Pearson correlation coefficient, to eliminate the features that have low correlation with the power output status parameter. Secondary analysis is performed to the remaining features, thus reducing the number and complexity of samples. Datasets are divided into the training set for training of the multiclass optimal margin distribution machine fault detection model and test set for testing. Experimental verification was carried out with the operating data of one wind farm in China. Experimental results show that, compared with other support vector machines, the proposed method has higher fault detection accuracy and precision and lower false-negative rate and false-positive rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, an evolutionary game model of the collaboration between the government and network knowledge community investors is constructed to address the problems of insufficient scale development of the network knowledge community and inconsistent internal mechanism. This model assists in determining the most appropriate internal mechanism for the development of the network knowledge community. The evolutionary game model, based on the system dynamic model fitting analysis, showed that the government and investors adopting positive strategy at the same time is for the optimal strategy. Promoting the network knowledge community construction is the key to improve the initial probability of both sides to take the active strategy, reducing the threshold of evolution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria is a global threat. However, an effective treatment regimen is still controversial and inadequate due to the rapid deterioration caused by the bacteria. In immunocompromised and neutropenic patients, MDR-BSI is an emergency, which causes treatment-related mortality. In this study, four agranulocytosis patients with hematologic malignancies after HSCT receiving treatment for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae- (CRE-) BSI were included. Conventional treatment using two to three combined antibiotics was administered in the first and second patients. Combination treatment using four drugs, polymyxin B, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and double-dose carbapenem, was administered in the third and fourth patients. None of the patients receiving conventional treatment survived. Both patients receiving combination treatment using four drugs survived. Therefore, four-drug combination therapy may be needed in CRE-BSI patients who experienced severe agranulocytosis after HSCT. The efficacy of the four-drug combination treatment for CRE-BSI patients as well as the adverse effects need to be further studied.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to characterise Vibrio species of water samples collected from taps, boreholes, and dams in the North West province, South Africa, and assess biocontrol potentials of their bacteriophages. Fifty-seven putative Vibrio isolates were obtained on thiosulfate-citrate-bile-salt-sucrose agar and identified using biochemical tests and species-specific PCRs. Isolates were further characterised based on the presence of virulence factors, susceptibility to eleven antibiotics, and biofilm formation potentials. Twenty-two (38.60%) isolates were confirmed as Vibrio species, comprising V. harveyi (45.5%, n = 10), V. parahaemolyticus (22.7%, n = 5), V. cholerae (13.6%, n = 3), V. mimicus (9.1%, n = 2), and V. vulnificus (9.1%, n = 2). Three of the six virulent genes screened were positively amplified; four V. parahaemolyticus possessed the tdh (18.18%) and trh (18.18%) genes, while the zot gene was harboured by 3 V. cholerae (13.64%) and one V. mimicus (4.55%) isolate. Isolates revealed high levels of resistance to cephalothin (95.45%), ampicillin (77.27%), and streptomycin (40.91%), while lower resistances (4.55%–27.27%) were recorded for other antimicrobials. Sixteen (72.7%) isolates displayed multiple antibiotic-resistant properties. Cluster analysis of antibiotic resistance revealed a closer relationship between Vibrio isolates from different sampling sites. The Vibrio species displayed biofilm formation potentials at 37°C (63.6, n = 14), 35°C (50%, n = 11), and 25°C (36.4%, n = 8). Two phages isolated in this study (vB_VpM_SA3V and vB_VcM_SA3V) were classified as belonging to the family Myoviridae based on electron microscopy. These were able to lyse multidrug-resistant V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae strains. These findings not only indicate the presence of antibiotic-resistant virulent Vibrio species from dam, borehole, and tap water samples that could pose a health risk to humans who either come in contact with or consume water but also present these lytic phages as alternative agents that can be exploited for biological control of these pathogenic strains.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Appropriate water body diversion can improve the water quality of Tai Lake. Excessive diversion of water would, however, dramatically alter the local flow fields, which are not conducive to the growth of aquatic plants and the stability of ecosystems. The current “Diverting Water from the Yangtze River to Tai Lake (DWYRTL)” project uses a single water source, the Wangyu River, for diversion, a model that may significantly affect the nearby flow rate or uniformity of the lake and is not conducive to the long-term stability of the aquatic ecosystem in the Tai Lake district of the eastern part of the lake. In order to simulate the different situations of single- and dual-source water diversions (Wangyu-Xinmeng Rivers) in Tai Lake, we based this study on a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with the Euler method, which can accurately calculate the water exchange rates in the different districts of Tai Lake. The results show that (1) it is recommended that the total annual diversion of water should not exceed 20 × 108 m3; (2) the wind field is the most important factor determining the distribution of spatial water exchange; (3) under wind-free conditions, the flow rate of a single-source diversion of water is approximately 50% higher than that of dual-source diversion; and (4) water diversion under the prevailing conditions of the northwest wind in winter will reduce the semiexchange period of the eastern part of the lake area from 50 to 30 days, significantly changing the nearby district’s uniformity, leading to ecological risks. Therefore, it is recommended that the dual-source water diversion mode be used in winter and windless season, and single-source water diversion mode be used in other seasons.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The size and position of the damping ditch have a direct impact on the blasting vibration. In order to explore the effect of damping ditches of different sizes and positions, we investigated field blasting in the A3 area of the second phase of the Lufeng Nuclear Power Plant project. The simulation software ANSYS/LS-DYNA was used to simulate the vibration propagation of damping ditches with different depths, widths, and positions. Secondly, the vibration data of the corresponding measuring points were collected and the amplitude reduction was analyzed in different situations. An analysis of the numerical simulation results showed that an increase in the damping ditch width increased the vibration amplitude at the top of the building. The depth and position of the damping ditch were the main factors affecting the damping performance. A regression analysis was conducted using the Sadove equation for vibration velocity. It was found that the regression coefficient of the Sadove equation did not meet the required standards when a damping ditch was present. The vibration attenuation equations were fitted for the top and the base of the building. The results of this study provide reference data for the excavation and arrangement of damping ditches in practical applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to further reveal the dynamic failure process of horizontal complex layered rock slope in the coupling action of earthquake and weathering, based on the three-dimensional particle flow software PFC3D, the rock triaxial test was first carried out to obtain the macroscopic rock mechanics parameters. Secondly, PFC3D was used to establish a three-dimensional discrete element model of slope under 4 modes. Finally, the Wenchuan earthquake wave dynamic input is used to simulate the coupling effect of each model slope on earthquake-weathering. Under the progressive failure process, the results show that, during the triaxial test, the mudstone particles and sandstone particles exhibited shear failure and tensile failure, respectively. The seismic failure mode of the horizontal complex layered rock slope model is divided into tensile fracture-horizontal sliding failure (cavity depth 1.5 m and fissure depth 25%), tensile cracking-caving-dumping failure (cavity depth 3 m and fissure depth 37.5%), caving-dumping-rotation failure (cavity depth 4.5 m and fissure depth 50%), and caving-slip-rotation failure (cavity depth 6 m and fissure depth 62.5%), and the maximum vertical displacement of Model 2 can reach 6.2 m, and the maximum positive horizontal displacement is 7.8 m. With the deepening of the weathering degree, the coordination number of the rock block shows the attenuation advance effect and the elevation attenuation effect during the seismic period of 2–15 s. The total energy dissipation of the slope can be divided into two stages: fracture collision and overall collapse. The energy dissipation is more concentrated in the rock fracture collision stage, accounting for 89% to 95% of the total energy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Scientists have explored the human body for hundreds of years, and yet more relationships between the behaviors and health are still to be discovered. With the development of data mining, artificial intelligence technology, and human posture detection, it is much more possible to figure out how behaviors and movements influence people’s health and life and how to adjust the relationship between work and rest, which is needed urgently for modern people against this high-speed lifestyle. Using smart technology and daily behaviors to supervise or predict people’s health is a key part of a smart city. In a smart city, these applications involve large groups and high-frequency use, so the system must have low energy consumption, a portable system, and a low cost for long-term detection. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a posture recognition method based on multisensor and using LoRa technology to build a long-term posture detection system. LoRa WAN technology has the advantages of low cost and long transmission distances. Combining the LoRa transmitting module and sensors, this paper designs wearable clothing to make people comfortable in any given posture. Aiming at LoRa’s low transmitting frequency and small size of data transmission, this paper proposes a multiprocessing method, including data denoising, data enlarging based on sliding windows, feature extraction, and feature selection using Random Forest, to make 4 values retain the most information about 125 data from 9 axes of sensors. The result shows an accuracy of 99.38% of extracted features and 95.06% of selected features with the training of 3239 groups of datasets. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, three testers created 500 groups of datasets and the results showed good performance. Hence, due to the energy sustainability of LoRa and the accuracy of recognition, this proposed posture recognition using multisensor and LoRa can work well when facing long-term detection and LoRa fits smart city well when facing long-distance transmission.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sanmiao pill (SMP), a Chinese traditional formula, had been used to treat gouty arthritis (GA). However, the active compounds and underlying mechanism remained unclear. Hence, network pharmacology and molecular docking were utilized to explore bioactive compounds and potential mechanism of action of SMP in treating GA. In the study, the compounds of SMP, corresponding targets, and GA-related targets were mined from various pharmacological databases. Then, herb-compound-target, compound-target, PPI, and target-pathway networks were constructed. Ultimately, molecular docking was carried out to verify the predicted results. The results indicated that 47 active compounds, 338 targets, and 144 disease targets were collected. Network analysis implied that Phellodendron chinense Schneid. played a vital role in the whole formula. Moreover, 7 compounds (quercetin, kaempferol, wogonin, rutaecarpine, baicalein, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol) and 4 targets (NFKB1, RELA, MAPK1, and TNF) might be the kernel compounds and targets of SMP against GA. According to GOBP and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and target-pathway network, SMP might exert a therapeutic role in GA by regulating numerous biological processes and pathways, including lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of transcription, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showcased that 11 pairs of compound with targets had tight binding strength. Thereinto, 4 compounds of MAPK1 and 5 compounds of NFKB1 possessed a better combination, suggesting that MAPK1 and NFKB1 might be considered as therapeutic targets in treatment of GA. This study verified that SMP had synergistic effect on GA by multicomponents, multitargets, and multipathways.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lignocellulosic biomass is a vital resource for providing clean future energy with a sustainable environment. Besides lignocellulosic residues, nonlignocellulosic residues such as sewage sludge from industrial and municipal wastes are gained much attention due to its large quantities and ability to produce cheap and clean energy to potentially replace fossil fuels. These cheap and abundantly resources can reduce global warming owing to their less polluting nature. The low-quality biomass and high ash content of sewage sludge-based thermal conversion processes face several disadvantages towards its commercialization. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize these residues in combination with coal for improvement in energy conversion processes. As per author information, no concrete study is available to discuss the synergy and decomposition mechanism of residues blending. The objective of this study is to present the state-of-the-art review based on the thermal coconversion of biomass/sewage sludge, coal/biomass, and coal/sewage sludge blends through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to explore the synergistic effects of the composition, thermal conversion, and blending for bioenergy production. This paper will also contribute to detailing the operating conditions (heating rate, temperature, and residence time) of copyrolysis and cocombustion processes, properties, and chemical composition that may affect these processes and will provide a basis to improve the yield of biofuels from biomass/sewage sludge, coal/sewage sludge, and coal/biomass blends in thermal coconversion through thermogravimetric technique. Furthermore, the influencing factors and the possible decomposition mechanism are elaborated and discussed in detail. This study will provide recent development and future prospects for cothermal conversion of biomass, sewage, coal, and their blends.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Using a self-designed hydraulic impact drilling test-bed and rock core drill, six groups of cylindrical granite specimens (93 mm dia. × 200 mm) containing central axial holes formed either by impact or nonimpact drilling methods were tested in uniaxial compression to failure on an Instron 1346 universal testing machine to investigate their mechanics and damage properties. The longitudinal acoustic wave velocities were measured before testing. The rock specimens were grouped according to the method of drilling the central hole (impact load exerted by different impact power and different frequencies for an approximately identical impact power, or nonimpact drilling). In this study, a statistical constitutive damage model based on Weibull distribution was used to calculate the degree of rock damage after drilling center holes. The experimental curves were measured to analyze the damage evolution process and the radius of rock damage. These indicate that rock damage increased with the increase of impact power and decreased with increasing impact frequency at constant impact power. This was also verified by the measured longitudinal wave velocity in all rock specimens. These results have significance for guiding the design of composite rock drilling tools that are dedicated to improving rock-breaking efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Occupational and environmental exposure to several pollutant factors such as petroleum products containing benzene has toxic effects on different body systems. The hematopoietic system and immune system are among the affected systems. This study aims to investigate the effect of benzene exposure on some blood parameters of workers at several fuel stations in Basra city, as well as to reveal if the continuous exposure may induce an inflammatory response, which is reflected by changes in some hematological and inflammatory markers. Methods. The study included two groups of males. The first group consists of 72 exposed workers at petrol stations in different locations in the Basra city. The other group is the control group, which consists of 75 nonexposed subjects (students and faculty members of the college). Different hematological parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, MCV, MCHC, and MCH) have been evaluated. Serum concentrations of IL-6 and hs-CRP were estimated in all workers and nonexposed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. Data showed significant hematological changes in the exposed workers, and that anemia was a common disorder among them. Furthermore, there was a significant decline in WBC and different types of WBC including lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils in the exposed workers. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum levels of interleukin-6 and hs-CRP were significantly higher in exposed workers than in nonexposed. A significant correlation was identified among blood parameters, while a strong inverse correlation was identified between both MCHC and ESR. The most significant inverse correlation was found between RBC and IL-6 and MCH with hs-CRP. In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between monocytes and IL-6. Conclusion. The changes in all hematology and inflammatory parameters refer to damage in the hematopoietic system due to continuous exposure to vapors of petrol products, which also result in a significant increase in interleukin-6.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) represents rare tooth anomalies that affect the quality and/or quantity of the enamel. Clinical phenotypes display a wide spectrum, ranging from mild color changes to severe structural alterations with daily pain. However, all affect the quality of life because of mechanical, psychological, esthetic, and/or social repercussions. Several gene mutations have been linked to AI as a nonsyndromic (isolated) phenotype or a wider syndrome. This case report aimed to present a family with dental structure anomalies followed up in the dental department of the Louis Mourier Hospital (APHP, France) for their extremely poor dental condition. The proband and his mother were clinically diagnosed with AI, and genetic analysis revealed an already described variant in DLX3. Then, the family was further examined for tricho-dento-osseous syndrome. This report illustrates the challenge of diagnosing dental structure anomalies, specifically AI, in adults and highlights the need for an accurate and accessible molecular diagnosis for those anomalies to discriminate between isolated and syndromic pathologies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome, the development of new therapeutic strategies is urgently required. One promising approach is to focus on the predisease state (so-called Mibyou in traditional Japanese medicine) before metabolic syndrome as a preemptive medical target. We recently succeeded in detecting a predisease state before metabolic syndrome using a mathematical theory called the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. The detected predisease state was characterized by 147 DNB genes among a total of 24,217 genes in TSOD (Tsumura-Suzuki Obese Diabetes) mice, a well-accepted model of metabolic syndrome, at 5 weeks of age. The timing of the predisease state was much earlier than the onset of metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice reported to be at approximately 8–12 weeks of age. In the present study, we investigated whether the predisease state in TSOD mice can be inhibited by the oral administration of a Kampo formula, bofutsushosan (BTS), which is usually used to treat obese patients with metabolic syndrome in Japan, from 3 to 7 weeks of age. We found the comprehensive suppression of the early warning signals of the DNB genes by BTS at 5 weeks of age and later. Specifically, the standard deviations of 134 genes among the 147 DNB genes decreased at 5 weeks of age as compared to the nontreatment control group, and 80 of them showed more than 50% reduction. In addition, at 7 weeks of age, the body weight and blood glucose level were significantly lower in the BTS-treated group than in the nontreatment control group. The results of our study suggest a novel mechanism of BTS; it suppressed fluctuations of the DNB genes at the predisease state before metabolic syndrome and thus prevented the subsequent transition to metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the preventive and preemptive effects of a Kampo formula on Mibyou before metabolic syndrome for the first time based on scientific evaluation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Detecting exploits is crucial since the effect of undetected ones can be devastating. Identifying their presence on the network allows us to respond and block their malicious payload before they cause damage to the system. Inspecting the payload of network traffic may offer better performance in detecting exploits as they tend to hide their presence and behave similarly to legitimate traffic. Previous works on deep packet inspection for detecting malicious traffic regularly read the full length of application layer messages. As the length varies, longer messages will take more time to analyse, during which time the attack creates a disruptive impact on the system. Hence, we propose a novel early exploit detection mechanism that scans network traffic, reading only 35.21% of application layer messages to predict malicious traffic while retaining a 97.57% detection rate and a 1.93% false positive rate. Our recurrent neural network- (RNN-) based model is the first work to our knowledge that provides early prediction of malicious application layer messages, thus detecting a potential attack earlier than other state-of-the-art approaches and enabling a form of early warning system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Predicting air quality is a complex task due to the dynamic nature, volatility, and high variability in time and space of pollutants and particulates. At the same time, being able to model, predict, and monitor air quality is becoming more and more relevant, especially in urban areas, due to the observed critical impact of air pollution on citizens’ health and the environment. In this paper, we employ a popular machine learning method, support vector regression (SVR), to forecast pollutant and particulate levels and to predict the air quality index (AQI). Among the various tested alternatives, radial basis function (RBF) was the type of kernel that allowed SVR to obtain the most accurate predictions. Using the whole set of available variables revealed a more successful strategy than selecting features using principal component analysis. The presented results demonstrate that SVR with RBF kernel allows us to accurately predict hourly pollutant concentrations, like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, and particulate matter 2.5, as well as the hourly AQI for the state of California. Classification into six AQI categories defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency was performed with an accuracy of 94.1% on unseen validation data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a new commensurate fractional-order chaotic oscillator is presented. The mathematical model with a weak feedback term, which is named hypogenetic flow, is proposed based on the Liu system. And with changing the parameters of the system, the hidden attractor can have no equilibrium points or line equilibrium. What is more interesting is that under the occasion that no equilibrium point can be obtained, the phase trajectory can converge to a minimal field under the lead of some initial conditions, similar to the fixed point. We call it the virtual equilibrium point. On the other hand, when the value of parameters can produce an infinite number of equilibrium points, the line equilibrium points are nonhyperbolic. Moreover than that, there are coexistence attractors, which can present hyperchaos, chaos, period, and virtual equilibrium point. The dynamic characteristics of the system are analyzed, and the parameter estimation is also studied. Then, an electronic circuit implementation of the system is built, which shows the feasibility of the system. At last, for the fractional system with hidden attractors, the finite-time synchronization control of the system is carried out based on the finite-time stability theory of the fractional system. And the effectiveness of the controller is verified by numerical simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present article aims to investigate the behaviour of Maxwell–Sutterby fluid past an inclined stretching sheet accompanied with variable thermal conductivity, exponential heat source/sink, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), and activation energy. By utilizing the compatible similarity transformations, the nondimensionless PDEs are converted into dimensionless ODEs and further these ODEs are tackled with the help of the bvp4c numerical technique. To check the legitimacy of upcoming results and reliability of the applied bvp4c numerical scheme, a comparison with existing literature and nonlinear shooting method is made. The numerical outcomes delivered here show that the temperature profile escalates due to an augmentation in the heat sink parameter and moreover mass fraction field escalates on account of an improvement in the activation energy parameter.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shizhen Bai</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The selection of agricultural product supplier is an important link to optimize the supply chain management of agricultural products. Due to the uncertainty factors and the lack of decision-makers’ cognition, the selection of agricultural products suppliers has become a very complex and difficult work. Therefore, in order to effectively deal with these problems, this study proposes an agricultural product supplier selection algorithm based on the Pythagorean fuzzy power Bonferroni mean operator under Pythagorean fuzzy environment. In this method, first, the power operator and Bonferroni mean operator are combined and embedded in the Pythagorean fuzzy sets to build a Pythagorean fuzzy power Bonferroni mean operator. Then, a multiattribute decision-making method based on the operator proposed in this paper is proposed. Finally, an analysis of examples of agricultural product supplier selection is given to verify the rationality and effectiveness of this method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to establish the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures, Lb. plantarum MNC 21, L. lactis MNC 24, and W. confusa MNC 20, isolated from a traditionally fermented sorghum-millet beverage from Uganda. The cultures were examined for tolerance to acid and bile salts, bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, antibiotic susceptibility, biogenic amine production, mucin degradation, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, adherence to the ileum, coaggregation, and antimicrobial properties against selected pathogenic species. Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012, a known probiotic, was the reference. The isolates were tolerant to acid (pH = 3) and bile (1%). W. confusa MNC 20 and Lb. plantarum MNC 21 exhibited medium BSH activity (11–15 mm diameter of hydrolysis zone) while L. lactis and Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012 exhibited low BSH activity (&lt;10 mm diameter of hydrolysis zone). All isolates lacked mucolytic activity. Lb. plantarum MNC 21 and W. confusa MNC 20 produced agmatine. The candidate and reference microorganisms were resistant to 10 of 21 and 5 of 21 antibiotics, respectively. The isolates exhibited hydrophobic, auto-aggregation and coaggregation properties. These three properties were exhibited more (p&lt;0.05) by the reference than the potential probiotics. The ability of the potential probiotics to attach onto the goat ileum (7.3–8.0 log cfu/cm2) was comparable to that of Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012 (7.6 log cfu/cm2). The four LAB inhibited E. coli, S. aureus, and S. enterica to the same extent (p&lt;0.05). The findings indicated potential probiotic activity of the starter cultures. However, further in vivo examination of these isolates is required to confirm their probiotic capabilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inhibition of either P2Y12 receptor or the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain- (NOD-) like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome provides cardioprotective effects. Here, we investigate whether direct NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition exerts additive effects on myocardial protection induced by the P2Y12 receptor antagonist Ticagrelor. Ticagrelor (150 mg/kg) was orally administered to rats for three consecutive days. Then, isolated hearts underwent an ischemia/reperfusion (30 min ischemia/60 min reperfusion; IR) protocol. The selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor INF (50 μM) was infused before the IR protocol to the hearts from untreated animals or pretreated with Ticagrelor. In parallel experiments, the hearts isolated from untreated animals were perfused with Ticagrelor (3.70 μM) before ischemia and subjected to IR. The hearts of animals pretreated with Ticagrelor showed a significantly reduced infarct size (IS, 49±3% of area at risk, AAR) when compared to control IR group (69±2% of AAR). Similarly, ex vivo administration of INF before the IR injury resulted in significant IS reduction (38±3% of AAR). Myocardial IR induced the NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation, which was attenuated by either INF pretreatment ex vivo, or by repeated oral treatment with Ticagrelor. The beneficial effects induced by either treatment were associated with the protective Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway activation and redox defence upregulation. In contrast, no protective effects nor NLRP3/RISK modulation were recorded when Ticagrelor was administered before ischemia in isolated heart, indicating that Ticagrelor direct target is not in the myocardium. Our results confirm that Ticagrelor conditioning effects are likely mediated through platelets, but are not additives to the ones achieved by directly inhibiting NLRP3.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction of herbal ingredients contained in Triphala recipe (Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellirica, and Phyllanthus emblica in equal proportion) using simplex lattice design. This work focused on chemical analysis of four phenolic compounds including gallic acid, corilagin, chebulagic acid, and chebulinic acid by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of the extraction technique (decoction vs. infusion) and gamma irradiation was also examined. The combination index was used as a tool for determination of interaction of the ingredients contained in the herbal recipe. Results showed that the extraction technique and gamma irradiation slightly altered the content of some phenolic compounds as well as the combination index. The positive interaction seems to be found at the equal proportion of the three plants. This work scientifically supported the suitable formula of the Triphala recipe in the traditional use.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During integrated nutrient management involving poultry manure (PM) and urea fertilizer (UF) for maize (Zea mays L.), it is necessary to investigate the best time to apply UF that will optimize soil chemical properties, growth, and yield of maize. Hence, studies were carried out to investigate the effect of different rates of PM and single and split applications (SA) of UF on soil chemical properties, growth, and yield of maize. The treatment involved three levels of PM (0.0, 4.0, and 8.0 t·ha−1) and four sets of periods of UF: (i) 0 kg N ha-1 (control), (ii) 120 kg N ha-1 applied at planting (AP), (iii) two SA of 120 kg N ha−1 (90 kg N ha-1 applied AP + 30 kg N ha-1 at thirty days after planting (DAP)), and (iv) three SA of 120 kg N ha-1 (60 kg N ha-1 applied AP + 30 kg N ha-1 thirty DAP + 30 kg N ha-1 at tasseling). The 12 treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times. PM and UF alone and integrating UF with PM improved soil chemical properties, growth, and yield of maize compared with the control. SA of UF three times (60 + 30 + 30) had the most improved soil chemical properties, growth, and yield of maize. Results also showed that maize yielded higher under UF integrated with PM compared with their sole forms. Application of 60 + 30+30 with 8 t ha−1PM (60 + 30+30 + 8 t ha−1PM) or with 4 t ha−1PM treatments showed the highest growth and yield of maize, but due to the bulkiness, handling challenges, and cost of PM, 60 + 30+30 + 4 t ha−1PM is recommended. Therefore, for better growth and yield of maize, after the initial application of PM, UF application should be split-applied in accordance with plant growth and the pattern of uptake to avoid losses by leaching and therefore ensured that N level in the soil is high at the critical stage of N demand.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve (NRLN) is a rare anatomical variation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) that may hinder the identification and preservation of this nerve during surgery and is associated with increased iatrogenic risks. Zuckerkandl’s tubercle (ZT) is considered a useful reference for locating the RLN during thyroid surgery. We report the case of an asymptomatic patient with a 23 mm uninodular goitre suspicious for cancer. Ultrasound examination showed a hypoechoic nodule with regular contours and microcalcifications. The patient had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels, and aspiration biopsy was suspicious for follicular cancer. She was treated with total thyroidectomy after the intraoperative examination confirmed the presence of a papillary thyroid carcinoma. The standard approach to the RLN below the inferior thyroid artery was used on both sides. The nerve displayed anatomical variation in the nonrecurrent form (NRLN) on the right side and was associated with another variation that was not found in the consulted literature. It was completely surrounded by thyroid tissue in the region of ZT, and the surgeon was forced to remove it from within the thyroid tissue. This combination of anatomical variations seems to be quite rare. Knowledge of the anatomy of the RLN and its variations, as well as its identification and careful dissection, is essential to avoid injury to the nerve during surgical procedures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Underweight is defined as being below the healthy weight range. Underweight in reproductive age group women not only affects women but also increases the risk of an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and child mortality. Various factors are linked with underweight among women. However, studies on the prevalence of underweight and its associated factors among women are limited in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of underweight and its associated factors among reproductive age group women in Ethiopia. Methods. For this study, data were drawn from the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey (EDHS). From the total, 15,683 women participants of the 2016 EDHS; a subsample of 2,848 participants aged 15–49 years who had a complete response to all variables of interest were selected and utilized for analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software program. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to assess the frequency distribution of underweight and is presented with different sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression models were applied for analysis. A two-sided p value of less than 0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association between the independent variables and underweight among women. Results. The prevalence of underweight among reproductive age group women in Ethiopia was 17.6%. The majority, 78.3% of underweight women, were rural dwellers. The odds of being underweight was higher among the young aged women, among those residing in rural areas, in those with higher educational status, and in those who have one or more children. On the other hand, the odds of underweight among respondents living in Benishangul, SNNPR, and Addis Ababa were less compared to those living in Dire Dawa. Similarly, the odds of underweight among participants with a higher level of husband or partner educational status and among those who chew Khat were less compared to their counterparts. Conclusion. Underweight among reproductive age group women in Ethiopia is still a major public health problem, particularly among rural dwellers. Underweight was significantly associated with different sociodemographic variables. Hence, context-based awareness creation programs need to be designed on the prevention methods of underweight in Ethiopia, giving especial emphasis to those residing in rural areas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Spexin (SPX, NPQ), a novel endogenous neuropeptide, was firstly identified by bioinformatics. Spexin gene and protein widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, such as the hypothalamus and digestive tract. The role of spexin in appetite regulation in mammalian is still unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism and effect of peripheral spexin on food intake in mice. During the light period, an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of spexin (10 nmol/mouse) significantly inhibited cumulative food intake at 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment in fasted mice. During the dark period, spexin (1 and 10 nmol/mouse, i.p.) significantly suppressed cumulative food intake at 4 and 6 h after treatment in freely feeding mice. The GALR3 antagonist SNAP37889, not GALR2 antagonist, significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect on cumulative food intake (0–6 h) induced by spexin. Spexin significantly reduced the mRNA level of Npy mRNA, not Agrp, Pomc, Cart, Crh, Orexin, or Mch, in the hypothalamus. Spexin (10 nmol/mouse, i.p.) increased the number of c-Fos positive neurons in hypothalamic AHA and SCN, but not in ARC, DMN, LHA, PVN, SON, or VMH. The hypothalamic p-CaMK2 protein expression was upregulated by spexin. This study indicated that acute peripheral injection of spexin inhibited mouse food intake. The anorectic effect may be mediated by GALR3, and inhibiting neuropeptide Y (NPY) via p-CaMK2 and c-Fos in the hypothalamus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present paper studies the application schemes of aerodynamic coefficient identification based on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm from free flight data. Two identification schemes utilizing the DE algorithm are proposed, including the whole discrete point (WDP) scheme and the differential interval linear (DIL) scheme. Several comparative tests are conducted to study the performances of the two schemes by using the noisy simulated flight data and the measured radar data. The results show satisfactory performance in estimating the aerodynamic coefficients for the two schemes. The WDP scheme provides more accurate and robust coefficients estimates in exchange of more than two times greater computational effort compared with the DIL scheme.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aerospace industry needs to be provided with system solutions to technologically challenging and mission-critical problems. Based on the industrial control point of view, development engineers must take costs and existing standards into account in order to effectively design, implement, and deploy control systems with reasonable costs. The customization and reusability are important factors associated with the production of new applications in order to reduce their costs, resources, and development time. In this work, the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)/Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach combined with the real-time Unified Modeling Language (UML)/Systems Modeling Language (SysML), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm, and hybrid automata is specialized to obtain a hybrid control model in order to conveniently deploy controllers of Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Q-UAVs). This hybrid control model also provides a real-time capsule pattern, which allows the designed elements to be customizable and reusable in new applications of various multirotor UAVs of the Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) type. The Q-UAV dynamics and control architecture are combined with the MDA/MBSE specialization as follows: the Computation Independent Model (CIM) is defined by specifying the use-case model together with the UKF algorithm and hybrid automata to intensively gather the control requirements. The Platform Independent Model (PIM) is then designed by specializing the real-time UML/SysML’s features to obtain the main control capsules, ports, and protocols, together with their dynamic evolution. The detailed PIM is subsequently transformed into the PSM by open-source platforms to rapidly implement and deploy the Q-UAV controller. The paper ends with trial flights and deployment results that show good feasibility to be used for a trajectory-tracking controller of a low-cost Q-UAV. In this case study, the Q-UAV controller is implemented with the simulation model in the OpenModelica tool. The obtained simulation results then allow the main control elements and their properties to be defined, as well as building the implementation libraries in the Arduino environment based on C++ language to quickly perform the realization model in the ATMEGA32-U2 and STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontrollers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fatigue life prediction is an important part of the reliability and durability analysis of automobile components. Based on Wang and Brown’s framework, multiaxial random fatigue damage was adopted to predict the fatigue life of half-shaft. The stress analysis of half-shaft was resolved analytically to determine the local stress tensor in the potential area of fracture. The maximum shear strain fatigue damage parameter and the normal stress fatigue damage parameter were evaluated to predict the fatigue life of half-shaft. The results show that the prediction method is reliable and meets the service life and safety requirements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Microglial inflammation plays an important part in the progression of multiple neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, depression, and traumatic encephalopathy. Here, we aimed to explore the role of pterostilbene (PTE) in the microglial inflammatory response and subsequent damage of cocultured neural cells and partially explain the underlying mechanisms. In the coculture system of lipopolysaccharide-activated BV-2 microglia and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, PTE (only given to BV-2) exhibited protection on SH-SY5Y cells, evidenced by improved SH-SY5Y morphology and viability and LDH release. It also attenuated SH-SY5Y apoptosis and oxidative stress, evidenced by TUNEL and DCFH-DA staining, as well as MDA, SOD, and GSH levels. Moreover, PTE upregulated SIRT-1 expression and suppressed acetylation of NF-κB p65 subunit in BV-2 microglia, thus decreasing the inflammatory factors, including TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, the effects above were reversed by SIRT-1 inhibitor EX527. These results suggest that PTE reduces the microglia-mediated inflammatory response and alleviates subsequent neuronal apoptosis and oxidative injury via increasing SIRT-1 expression and inhibiting the NF-κB signalling pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The asymmetric capacitor’s lift force formula can be obtained on the basis of literature review, which can almost cover all practical forms of asymmetric capacity forms. But there are still some problems we should solve. The first and foremost one is whether the formulas are correct and can they be verified in engineering practices? On the contrary, the parameter q in the formulas is normally unknown in the beginning of calculations, how can we get or reckon up it so as to use the formulas smoothly? In this paper, we set out to solve these questions.</dc:description>

A Prospective Randomised Controlled Study in a Tertiary Center</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Müge Keskin</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ruşen Aytaç</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment for couples with subfertility. Clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, and letrozole are used for ovulation induction in IUI cycles. It has been well documented that luteal support with exogenous progesterone after in vitro fertilization is associated with higher pregnancy and live birth rates. Yet, luteal phase support in IUI cycles has become a debatable issue. The aim of this prospective controlled study was to assess the effect of luteal phase vaginal progesterone supplementation on β-hCG positivity and clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IUI. This prospective controlled randomised study was conducted at a tertiary infertility center. 87 patients with unexplained infertility or male subfertility who were treated with IUI using gonadotropins were enrolled. Patients in the study group (n = 44) received luteal phase vaginal progesterone supplementation. Patients in the control group (n = 43) did not receive any luteal phase support. There was no statistical difference between two groups in terms of β-hCG positivity and clinical pregnancy rates. Our findings do not show any beneficial effect of luteal phase support in IUI cycles stimulated with gonadotropins. Although luteal phase support in IUI cycles stimulated with gonadotropins is widely adopted, there is a lack of robust evidence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cemented paste backfill (CPB) can effectively eliminate the risk of dam break in goaf and tailings pond which used tailings waste. Deep cone thickener (DCT) is an efficient machine for the system of paste preparation, and the concentration of slurry at the bottom is high and distributed unevenly, which will cause too much partial resistance and failure of thickener. Focusing on the above problems, fluidization design was conducted by using the fluidization theory. The delivery law of flocs was analyzed, and the isobaric surface was obtained. The equation of pressure and critical velocity of the ideal fluidized bed was acquired by analyzing the relationship between pressure and critical velocity. Based on the characteristics of tailings and distribution of the bonding zone, the arrangement, number, and working mode of spray nozzles were reformed. It is verified that the failure time of thickener decreased from 14 hours to 1 hour and the range of concentration increased from 74%∼78% to 78%∼80%, which improved the stability and reliability of DCT. The depth thickening mechanism is obtained, and the thickening method has been improved which provides a theoretical basis for the effective preparation of paste.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Quite a number of shallow buried coal seams (SBCS) are distributed in China. The overburden is easily damaged due to the mining of SBCS, resulting in water resources loss and surface damage. Taking 12403 working face of Wulanmulun coal mine in Shendong mining area as an example, this paper analyzed the overburden migration and failure characteristics after mining SBCS with thick loose layer based on actual measurement data and simulation results. The results show that the subsidence of strata in caving zone has no skewness feature along strike direction, while the subsidence of strata in fracture zone and bending subsidence zone shows skewness subsidence phenomenon. An interface exists in the overburden, and the movements of upper and lower strata at the interface have different characteristics. The cracks penetrating the whole strata exist in bedrock, not in aeolian sand. The height of water flowing fracture zone is 35.74 m–62.89 m according to the loss of fluid in the borehole and consistent with the results of numerical simulation and similar simulation. This study can provide a reference for the prediction of the height of water flowing fracture zone and the overburden migration in mining SBCS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study aims to investigate the effects and mechanisms of sarsasapogenin resistance to precocious puberty. Female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into a normal (N) group, model (M) group, leuprolide (L) group, and sarsasapogenin (Sar) group. Rats at 5 days of age were given a single subcutaneous injection of 300 micrograms of danazol to establish the precocious puberty model. After 10 days of modeling, drug intervention was started. The development of the uterus and ovary was observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The levels of the serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E2) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Also, the expressions of the hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), Kiss-1, G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54), and pituitary gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) were detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that compared with the model group, sarsasapogenin could significantly delay the opening time of vaginal, decreased uterine and ovarian coefficients, and reduced uterine wall thickness. Moreover, it can significantly downregulate the levels of serum hormones and reduce the expression of GnRH, GnRH-R, and kiss-1. In summary, our results indicate that sarsasapogenin can regulate the HPG axis through the kiss-1/GPR54 system for therapeutic precocious puberty.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength or sarcopenia is attributed to the high level of oxidative stress and inadequate nutritional intake. The imbalance in oxidative status with increased production of free radicals results in damage to the DNA which leads to cell dysfunction. This study aimed to determine the effect of Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) on muscle performance and bone integrity in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. SD rats aged three (young), nine (adult), and twenty-one (old) months old were treated with either distilled water or ginger extract at a concentration of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) daily for 3 months via oral gavage. Muscle performance was assessed at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment by measuring muscle strength, muscle function, and bone integrity while DNA damage was determined by comet assay. Muscle cell histology was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Young and adult ginger-treated rats showed a significant improvement in muscle strength after 3 months of supplementation. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were increased while fat free mass (FMM) was decreased after 3 months of ginger supplementation in young rats but not changed in adult and old ginger supplemented groups. Interestingly, supplementation of ginger for 3 months to the old rats decreased the level of damaged DNA. Histological findings showed reduction in the size of muscle fibre and fascicles with heterogenous morphology of the muscle fibres indicating sarcopenia was evident in old rats. Treatment with ginger extract improved the histological changes even though there was evidence of cellular infiltration (mild inflammation) and dilated blood vessels. In conclusion, Z. officinale Roscoe prevents DNA damage and improves muscle performance and bone integrity in SD rats indicating its potential in alleviating oxidative stress in ageing and thus delaying sarcopenia progression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Vaginal or genitourinary infections are a major cause of morbidity, sterility, and increase in the vulnerability to cancers and HIV/AIDS infection. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vaginal infections of C. albicans, G. vaginalis, and T. vaginalis among women in the locality of Dschang, West Region of Cameroon. Method. A prospective study was carried out in the District Hospital of Dschang. After obtaining informed consent, one thousand and one (1001) samples of vaginal swabs were collected. Biological diagnosis was carried out on fresh samples, Gram stained, and then cultivated in Sabouraud agar in a Petri dish, in order to isolate and identify the various infectious agents. Results. Five hundred and twenty-five (525) women were diagnosed positive, hosting at least one of these microorganisms, making an overall prevalence of 52.44%. Two hundred and fifty-six (256) women (25.57%) were infected with C. albicans, and 171 (17.08%) with G. vaginalis. Ninety-five (9.49%) were infected with both C. albicans and G. vaginalis, 2 (0.20%) with C. albicans and T. vaginalis, and 1 (0.1%) with G. vaginalis and T. vaginalis. Conclusion. Drastic measures should be taken in order to improve life styles to regress the frequency of these infections. Results obtained in this study, will help to educate and shed more light on the prevalence of vaginal infections in the West Region of Cameroon.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the present study, the synthesis of three 1,8-naphthalimide-acridinyl hybrids (2a, 2b, and 5b) using N-amido-1,8-naphthalimides (1 and 4) and acridinyl isothiocyanates is reported. The newly synthesized hybrids were evaluated for their anticancer activity in six human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MT-4, HepG2, HeLa, SK-OV-3, and MCF-7). Their inhibition activity against DNA-topoisomerase I (Topo I) and Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was also studied. The results indicate that 2b displayed good cytotoxicity for MT-4, HepG2, HeLa, and SK-OV-3 with the IC50 values of 14.66 ± 0.31, 27.32 ± 2.67, 17.51 ± 0.34, and 32.26 ± 1.74 μM, respectively. All compounds, especially 2b, exhibited obvious bands corresponding to DNA fragments at 0.5 mM concentration, further confirming the pharmacological mechanism related to the Topo I inhibitory activities. In addition, compound 2a exhibited higher inhibition activity against AChE than 2b and 5b, with IC50 values of 0.32 ± 0.04 mM, and the acridinyl ring may contribute to the activity of 2a.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As a social problem involving a wide range of objects, targeted poverty alleviation governance needs to clearly define stakeholders and identify their behaviour choices, so as to seek a multiagent collaborative governance strategy, and strive to jointly promote the realization of a targeted poverty alleviation goals in an atmosphere to win-win cooperation and benefit sharing. By constructing a three-subject evolutionary game model of local government, social organization, and poverty group in the process of targeted poverty alleviation, this paper discusses the influence of their behavioural decisions on multisubject collaborative governance of targeted poverty alleviation and selects samples to carry out simulation experiments on the model. The results show that, first, superior government support has little effect on the evolution of tripartite competition, and the conclusion is inconsistent with the general cognition. However, the enhancement of support from local governments and social organizations can effectively promote the transformation of the willingness of the poor groups to cooperate. Second, a modest increase in the punishment of social organizations and poor groups can have a binding effect on the behavioural strategy choices of both sides and ultimately promote the process of targeted poverty alleviation. Third, the increase in the benefits of social organizations and poor groups can significantly improve the willingness of both sides to cooperate, so the “endogenous driving force” of the poor groups should be enhanced to achieve the Pareto optimal state of targeted poverty alleviation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper studied the impact dynamic modeling of the planar constrained metamorphic mechanism (PCMM) during configuration transformation. Based on the dynamic theory of the multi-rigid-body system and the coefficient of restitution equation, a new method for dynamic modeling of PCMM considering impact motions generated by configuration transformation is presented, which can be treated as a theoretical foundation for performance design and dynamic control. Firstly, the topology theory based on the impact motion can be classified as the stable impact motion and the mobile impact motion, which is the prerequisite for dynamic modeling and simulation. Secondly, the stable and mobile impact dynamic models for PCMM are established according to the dynamic theory of the multi-rigid-body system. Then, using these models, the corresponding impulse solving models are deduced combining with the coefficient of restitution equation. Finally, the examples of the stable impact motion and the mobile impact motion are respectively given, and the configuration-complete dynamic simulations are carried out. By comparing with the dynamic models without considering the impact motion, the dynamic characteristics of PCMM are analyzed. The theory and method proposed in this paper can be also applied in general planar robotic systems to deal with the problem of internal collision dynamics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a new transmission mechanism with multistage face gears as the core components for realizing variable speeds with differential meshing. To improve face gear transmission smoothness, suppress meshing resonance, reduce noise, and optimize power transmission performance during the gear shifting process, load distribution between meshing teeth during the transmission process and impact loads during various shifting stages must be determined. Herein, we present a gear impact model considering double crown gear meshing configuration, contact deformation, variable working conditions, and jump impact at meshing points. A single-stage face gear pair is considered as object that the impact characteristics are comparatively studied under four conditions: with/without load and constant/variable speed. The results were used to analyze transient characteristics of the crown gear under contact deformation or frequent shifting impact. Based on this, the impact characteristics of multistage face gear pairs between ratio switching were extendedly investigated under four input conditions: constant/variable torque or constant/variable speed. The results were used to determine the meshing force and impact force fluctuation characteristics of multistage face gear pairs while adapting to various loads and continuous acceleration/deceleration. The proposed model can be beneficial to evaluate the feasibility of multistage gear structures with crown configuration and to obtain boundary conditions for transmission systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We consider the problem of remote estimation with time delay and multiplicative noise for multichannel systems. First, we apply the reorganized innovation analysis approach to construct the original delay system into a new delay-free system. Secondly, the delay-free system will be reconstructed by the quadratic filtering method to obtain an augmented system. Then, Kalman filtering theory and projection formula are used to solve two Riccati equations and one Lyapunov equation for the augmented system, and the quadratic filter for the measurement delay system on the packet loss network can be obtained. Finally, we use a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Foot-and-mouth disease virus remains one of the most important livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and several Southeast Asian countries. Vaccination of livestock has been recognized as an important tool for the control of foot-and-mouth disease virus. However, this intervention strategy has some limitations. Generally, vaccine production is a complex multistep process which involves development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, and through this extensive process, some challenges such as poor vaccine storage often arise. More often, these challenges alter the validity of the vaccination. Foot-and-mouth disease virus epidemic dynamics have been extensively explored, but understanding the role of vaccination validity on virus endemicity is lacking. We present a time-delayed foot-and-mouth disease model that incorporates relevant biological and ecological factors, vaccination effects, and disease carriers. We determined the basic reproduction number and demonstrated that it is an important metric for persistence and extinction of the disease in the community. Numerical illustrations were utilised to support some of the analytical results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gardner’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the APC gene with 20–30% of cases presenting de novo. This entity is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis, with a prevalence of 3/100,000 habitants. It may present as early as 2 months of age with a variety of both colonic and extracolonic symptoms. We report a case of a 21-year-old man, without any known family history, presenting with microcytic hypochromic anemia and constitutional symptoms for two months. Ultimately, after the etiological study, Gardner syndrome diagnosis was established as an index primary familiar case. Gardner syndrome is a clinical challenge which requires a prompt suspicion in order to reach its diagnosis. Given the malignant evolution of adenomas in 100% of untreated patients, early identification of extraintestinal manifestations (identifiable prior to colonic symptoms) is of the essence. A consequent endoscopic study to confirm gastrointestinal involvement is essential for a more favorable prognosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>5-Hydroxymethylfurfural as a versatile organic compound is considered as a promising biomass-derived product via hydrolysis followed by dehydration of lignocellulosic biomass using solid catalysts. In this study, lignocellulosic materials (corncob) were utilized to synthesize 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via solid acid catalytic conversion. The precursor of the catalyst material was chemically impregnated with ZnCl2 prior to carbonization. The solid catalyst was prepared with three different acid concentrations of 98%, 96%, and 94% of sulfuric acid. The prepared catalyst was characterized by acid density elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, and SEM. The maximum result of the total acid density and amount of SO3H group was recorded as 3.5 mmol/g and 0.61 mmol/g, respectively, with high sulfur content of 1.87%. The result from FTIR spectra of BC-SO3H−1 confirms the incorporation of -SO3H groups into the carbon material. BC-SO3H−1 was selected based on the acid density and elemental analysis of the catalyst. The activity of the selected catalyst (BC-SO3H−1) was studied on the transformation of corncob to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using biphasic solvent (water: ethyl acetate) and NaCl in the reaction medium. The intermediate result in the hydrolysis\dehydration reaction was analyzed using FTIR and the functional groups observed confirm the occurrence of 5-HMF in the intermediate reaction result.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Improving the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen is currently a hot topic in research. TiO2 nanosheets are a good carrier of photocatalytic materials and have become attractive materials in the new century because of their high active surface exposure characteristics and special morphology. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of conventional chemical and physical methods that are used for preparing TiO2 nanosheets, an optimized scheme for the preparation of TiO2 nanosheets via hydrothermal calcination was proposed. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-visible diffuse reflection absorption spectra (DRS) were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the TiO2 nanosheets, and differences in the photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production activity of the different calcination temperatures were compared. The suitable calcination temperature of the TiO2 nanosheets was 400°C, and the hydrogen production rate was 270 μmol/h, which indicated that the sheet structure was beneficial for improving the photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production performance of the material. It is hoped that this work will support the regulation of the surface morphology and surface modification of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Osteoporosis (OP) is a well-established age-related disease, pathologically characterized by bone microarchitectural deterioration, increased fragility, and low BMD. Primary osteoporosis (POP) is the most common type of OP. Methods. Publications pertaining to the effectiveness of kinesitherapy on BMD in POP from PubMed, SCI, Cochrane Library, Embase, VIP, CNKI, and Wanfang Database were retrieved from their inception to October 2019. Results. A total of 21 studies with 1840 participants were included. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that kinesitherapy plus antiosteoporosis medications had a positive effect on lumbar spine BMD when the duration of intervention was 6 months (MD = 0.11 g/cm2; 95% CI: 0.06–0.15; P&lt;0.0001) or &gt;6 months (MD = 0.04 g/cm2; 95% CI: 0.02–0.06; P&lt;0.0001) compared with antiosteoporosis medications alone. Additional kinesitherapy plus antiosteoporosis medications were associated with improved femoral neck BMD compared with antiosteoporosis medications alone (MD = 0.09 g/cm2; 95% CI: 0.03–0.16; P=0.004). Conclusions. Kinesitherapy plus antiosteoporosis medications significantly improved lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in the current low-quality evidence. Additional high-quality evidence is required to confirm the effect of kinesitherapy on BMD in patients with POP.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to simplify the ratio decision process of cemented backfill in underground mines and achieve fine decision of filling ratio, the research on the energy matching between surrounding rock and cemented backfill in underground mines was conducted in this study. Based on the cubic function strength model of cemented backfill, the peak specific energy equation of backfill was improved by inversion analysis of the data of filling ratio experiment, and the functional relationship between the peak specific energy and the filling ratio was obtained by regression analysis. Then, based on the energy balance principle between the deformation energy released by the excavation of the underground rock mass and the peak specific energy of the cemented backfill, considering the physical and mechanical parameters of the surrounding rock of the goaf, including bulk density, elastic modulus, and burial depth, a ratio decision model of cemented backfill is established. The application results suggested that the calculation result of the model is reliable, and it can realize the rapid and accurate decision of the ratio of cement backfill in underground mines.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is widely acknowledged that cancer cell energy metabolism relies mainly on anaerobic glycolysis; this phenomenon is described as the Warburg effect. However, whether the Warburg effect is caused by genetic dysregulation in cancer or is the cause of cancer remains unknown. The exact reasons and physiology of this abnormal metabolism are unclear; therefore, many researchers have attempted to reduce malignant cell growth in tumors in preclinical and clinical studies. Anticancer strategies based on the Warburg effect have involved the use of drug compounds and dietary changes. We recently reviewed applications of the Warburg effect to understand the benefits of this unusual cancer-related metabolism. In the current article, we summarize diet strategies for cancer treatment based on the Warburg effect.</dc:description>

A total of 106 participants underwent binocular vision assessment by evaluating horizontal heterophoria, horizontal and vertical fusional vergence ranges, and vergence facility. Posturography was measured using the FreeMED baropodometric platform. Among the variables that the software calculates are foot surface, foot load, and foot pressure. Our results showed that in the participants with positive fusional vergence (PFV) (near) blur and recovery values outside the norm, there are statistically significant differences between the total foot area (p&lt;0.05), forefoot area (p&lt;0.05), forefoot load (p&lt;0.05), and rearfoot load (p&lt;0.05), in all of the cases of left foot vs. right foot. In the group of subjects who did not meet Sheard’s criterion (distance), that is, those with unstable binocular vision, there was a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.01) between maximum left and right foot pressure. In conclusion, our results establish a relationship between nonstrabismic binocular dysfunctions and some baropodometric parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The point-based surface registration method involves the manual selection process of paired matching points on the data of computed tomography and optical scan. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of selection error and distribution of fiducial points on the accuracy of image matching between 3-dimensional (3D) images in dental planning software programs. Computed tomography and optical scan images of a partial edentulous dental arch were obtained. Image registration of the optical scan image to computed tomography was performed using the point-based surface registration method in planning software programs under different conditions of 3 fiducial points: point selection error (0, 1, or 2 mm), point distribution (unilateral, bilateral), and planning software (Implant Studio, Blue Bio Plan) (n=5 per condition, N=60). The accuracy of image registration at each condition was evaluated by measuring linear discrepancies between matched images at X, Y, and Z axes. Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, and 3-way analysis of variance were used to statistically analyse the measurement data (α=0.05). No statistically significant difference was exhibited between the 0 and 1 mm point mismatch conditions in either unilateral or bilateral point distributions. The discrepancy values in the 2 mm mismatch condition were significantly different from the other mismatch conditions, especially in the unilateral point distribution (P&lt;0.05). Strong interactions among point selection error, distribution, and software programs on the image registration were found (P&lt;0.001). Minor matching point selection error did not influence the accuracy of point-based automatic image registration in the software programs. When the fiducial points are distributed unilaterally with large point selection error, the image matching accuracy could be decreased.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Drivers’ decisions to either slow and stop or go at the onset of yellow signal impact on intersection safety. This novel study contributes to the new classification scheme for drivers. Two driving style indexes (i.e., the driving reliability index and dangerous driving index) are adopted, along with other known factors to analyze stop/go decision-making. Initially, the driving reliability index is extracted using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dangerous driving index is calculated based on statistics extracted from dangerous driving records. A latent class logit model is then proposed to explore the factors which influence drivers’ decisions. Drivers are classified for analytical purposes into “low-risk” and “high-risk” categories according to driving styles and age. Results indicate that those considering “low-risk” tend to stop, while drivers considering “high-risk” are inclined to pass intersections. Furthermore, distractions from cell phones have different influences on each group of drivers. These findings help to determine driver preferences and may be used to formulate strategies to reduce unsafe driving occurring at signalized intersections.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of comorbid diabetes on short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with stage I/II colon cancer after open colectomy. Methods. The data were extracted from the National Inpatient Sample database (2005-2010). Short-term surgical outcomes included in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and hospital length of stay. Results. A total of 49,064 stage I/II colon cancer patients undergoing open surgery were included, with a mean age of 70.35 years. Of them, 21.94% had comorbid diabetes. Multivariable analyses revealed that comorbid diabetes was significantly associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality and postoperative complications. Compared to patients without diabetes, patients with uncomplicated diabetes had lower percentages of in-hospital mortality and postoperative complications, but patients with complicated diabetes had a higher percentage of postoperative complications. In addition, patients with diabetes only, but not patients with diabetes and hypertension only, had a lower percentage of in-hospital mortality than patients without any comorbidity. Conclusion. The present results suggested the protective effects of uncomplicated diabetes on short-term surgical outcomes in stage I/II colon cancer patients after open colectomy. Further studies are warranted to confirm these unexpected findings and investigate the possible underlying mechanisms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Acute pancreatic injury can be related to both parenchymal (responsible for exocrine functions) and islet (mainly β-cells, responsible for endocrine functions) damage. During embryonic development, both the salivary glands and the pancreas originate from the foregut, which explains many of the observed histological and functional similarities between these two organs. The relationship between several diseases of the pancreas and salivary glands, resulting from morphological and functional similarities, is well established. Sphingolipids constitute a class of biologically active molecules involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including acute pancreatitis (AP) and diabetes mellitus. However, the effect of AP on sphingolipid metabolism in the salivary glands remains uncertain. In the presented study, we examined the effect of AP and type 1 diabetes mellitus on sphingolipid metabolism in the salivary glands of rats. We demonstrated that acute pancreatic injury, related to both exocrine and endocrine functions, affects the metabolism of sphingolipids in the parotid, but not submandibular, salivary glands.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the primary stability of two implants with the same macro- and micromorphology but different thread design and analyze their clinical outcomes over a one-year period. Materials and Methods. 14 patients needing a partial rehabilitation with a delayed loading approach (DEL group: 9 patients) or a full-arch rehabilitation treated with immediately loaded fixed prostheses supported by 4 implants following the Columbus Bridge Protocol (CBP) (IL group: 5 patients) were included. In each patient, at least one SY (implant with standard threads) and one SL implant (implant with an augmented depth of the threads) were randomly inserted. Primary outcome measures were the number of threads exposed at a torque of 30 Ncm and 50 Ncm and final insertion torque. Secondary outcome measures were implant and prosthetic failure, peri-implant bone resorption, and periodontal parameters: bleeding on probing (BoP), plaque index (PI), and probing depth (PD) evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months of healing. Results. Nineteen SY and 19 SL implants were inserted in 14 patients. Twenty implants (10 SL and 10 SY) were inserted in the IL group, while 18 (9 SL and 9 SY) were inserted in the DEL group and followed-up for 12 months. No patients dropped out. No implants and prostheses failed. No biological complications were identified. No significant differences were found between SY and SL implants comparing the number of exposed threads when inserting the implant with a torque insertion of 30 N (T student test p=.142 and U test p=.164). At 50 N, no threads were visible in either groups. Final torque insertion values were higher for SL (mean: 48.42 Ncm) compared to SY implants (mean: 43.42 Ncm) without a statistically significant difference. All the implants showed good clinical outcomes at the 1-year-in-function visit. Conclusions. After 12 months of function, both implant types provided good clinical outcomes without statistically significant differences between the two groups. A difference in insertion torque (even if not statistically significant) was found with higher insertion torque values for SL implants with a larger thread depth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is closely related to the incidence and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD), and the mechanisms linking OSA and CAD are multifactorial. C1q/TNF-related protein-9 (CTRP9) is a novel adipokine that protects the heart against ischemic injury and ameliorates cardiac remodeling. We aimed to ascertain the clinical relevance of CTRP9 with OSA prevalence in patients with CAD. Methods. From August 2016 to March 2019, consecutive eligible patients with CAD (n=154; angina pectoris, n=88; acute myocardial infarction [AMI], n=66) underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 events·h−1. Plasma CTRP9 concentrations were measured by ELISA method. Results. Moderate/severe OSA was present in 89 patients (57.8%). CTRP9 levels were significantly decreased in the moderate/severe OSA group than in the no/mild OSA group (4.7 [4.1-5.2] ng/mL vs. 4.9 [4.4-6.0] ng/mL, P=0.003). The difference between groups was only observed in patients with AMI (3.0 [2.3-4.9] vs. 4.5 [3.2-7.9], P=0.009). Correlation analysis showed that CTRP9 levels were negatively correlated with AHI (r=−0.238, P=0.003) and oxygen desaturation index (r=−0.234, P=0.004) and positively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r=0.251, P=0.004) in all subjects. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (OR 3.099, 95% CI 1.029-9.330, P=0.044), BMI (OR 1.148, 95% CI 1.040-1.268, P=0.006), and CTRP9 levels (OR 0.726, 95% CI 0.592-0.890, P=0.002) were independently associated with the prevalence of moderate/severe OSA. Conclusions. Plasma CTRP9 levels were independently related to the prevalence of moderate/severe OSA in patients with CAD, suggesting that CTRP9 might play a role in the pathogenesis of CAD exacerbated by OSA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There remain few data about the role of homeostatic compaction in hepatic polarization. A previous study has found that mechanical compaction can accelerate hepatocyte polarization; however, the cellular mechanism underlying the effect is mostly unclear. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) is crucial for hepatic polarization in liver morphogenesis. Therefore, we sought to identify any possible involvement of HNF4α in the process of hepatocyte polarization accelerated by mechanical compaction. We first verified in the nonhepatic cell model HEK-293T, and the hepatic cell model primary hepatocytes that the mechanical compaction on cell aggregates simulated by using transient centrifugation can directly activate the expression of HNF4α promoters. Moreover, data using primary hepatocytes showed that the HNF4α expression is positively associated with the levels of compaction force: 2.1-folds higher at the mRNA level and 2.1-folds higher at the protein level for 500 g vs. 0 g. Furthermore, activated HNF4α expression is associated with the enhanced biliary canalicular formation and the increased production of albumin and urea. Pretreatment with Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of F-actin, and SHE78-7, an inhibitor of E-cadherin, which both interrupt the pathway of mechanical transduction, partially but significantly reduced the HNF4α expression and production of albumin and urea. In conclusion, HNF4α can be actively involved in the hepatic polarization in the context of environmental mechanical compaction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Water–sand inrush is one of the most serious disasters for mining in China. The evaluation of the occurrence and development of a high-concentration water and sand mixed fluid is an important issue for mining in China. In this study, contraposing to the 3 phases of water–sand inrush, three kinds of experiments are designed for the investigation of initiation, development, and occurrence of the disaster. A new sand–water transport testing system is setup to perform the tests. The results show that there are two key points in the disaster: (1) sand particle incipient motion and (2) porous skeleton structural instability. The incipient motion of sand grains is accompanied with the phenomena of volumetric dilatation and granular fluidization. The critical velocity of the incipient motion of the water–sand mixed fluid is significantly affected by the particle size and external stress. The interaction between water and sand grains is the key factor affecting the motion characteristics of water–sand mixture. When the hydraulic conditions exceed the threshold, the water and sand grains are mutually promoted, and the aquifer skeleton becomes unstable. Furthermore, during the water–sand inrush, the curves of volumetric flow rates of sand and water, respectively, for different samples manifest as two distinct waveforms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Giant Cell Tumour of Bone (GCTB) is a rare bone tumour. Locally aggressive and recurrent, it might evolve into pulmonary metastases. Our present work is aimed at investigating the involvement of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) family and its downstream effectors in the development and recurrence of GCTB. For this purpose, we used a cohort of 32 GCTB patients and we evaluated the clinicohistological features and the expression of RANKL, EGFR, and HER2. The mutation status of KRAS, PI3KCA, and PTEN gene as potential oncogene involved in GCTB was also evaluated. We found a significant correlation between advanced histological stages, overexpression of EGFR/HER2, and tumour recurrence. Moreover, two mutations were found in the PIK3CA gene: a missense mutation, 1634A&gt;C, detected for the first time in GCTB patients, without influencing the stability of the protein, and a frameshift mutation, c.1658_1659delGTinsC, causing the loss of the protein kinase domain. Altogether, these results suggest that overexpression of HER2/EGFR, Campanacci, and histological stages could be used as a novel prognostic marker for GCTB recurrence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of studies have confirmed that DNA methylation disorder (5mC/5hmC) is closely related to the occurrence and development of some diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study aims at discovering natural compounds that could adjust and control 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels and improve Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuronal status. Cordycepin and cordycepic acid were selected as research materials, with resveratrol as positive control. The results of Dot Blot indicated that cordycepin, cordycepic acid, and resveratrol significantly increased the expression level of 5hmC. Combined with qPCR results, it was revealed that cordycepin increased the expression of ten-eleven translocation (TETs) mRNA compared with the abovementioned cordycepic acid and resveratrol. Besides, cordycepin dramatically reduced the transcription level of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), suggesting that cordycepin might hinder the formation of NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) and the accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain by reducing the expression of ApoE, resulting in affecting the progression of AD. Meanwhile, the immunofluorescence (IF) staining results demonstrated that the percentage of differentiation of SHSY-5Y cells reasonably increased after the treatment of cordycepin and cordycepic acid. Simultaneously, the length of axons and the number of dendritic branches in mouse primary neurons were substantially increased by cordycepin. The screening results illustrated that cordycepin had a positive influence on the level of 5hmC and the morphology of neurons, and most of the effects were better compared to the positive control (resveratrol). It indicated that cordycepin delayed the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. However, the specific mechanism of action still needs to be further investigated. Our research provided a foundation for further discussion about the influence of cordycepin on AD and a new idea for the pathological study of related diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper investigates the problem of designing angle constraint guidance law against unknown maneuvering targets based on discrete-time sliding mode control theory. Invoking the fact that the future course of action of the target, an independent entity, cannot be predicted beforehand due to its complexity and unpredictability, a model-assisted discrete-time disturbance observer in cooperation with a singularity-free strategy is proposed first to estimate the target maneuver. Based on the reconstructed signal and a fast convergence time-varying sliding surface, a new chattering-mitigated super-twisting-like discrete-time impact angle constraint guidance law is then synthesized. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system trajectory can be forced to enter into a small region around the sliding surface. Simulations and comparisons with classical discrete-time sliding mode guidance law validate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The increasing mortality and morbidity of malaria in Africa coupled with the recent reports of antimalarial drug resistance reinforces the need for novel antimalarial agents from natural plant products with folkloric use for the disease. Murraya exotica (L.) (Rutaceae) is widely used as an ornamental plant used indigenously to treat fever, cough, and infectious wounds and eliminate pain from injury and trauma. This study was conducted to evaluate extracts of the leaves of Murraya exotica (L.) (Rutaceae) for its safety and antipyretic and antimalarial activity in rodent models. Method. In this study, the Peters 4-day suppressive and curative test in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice was used to demonstrate the antiplasmodial activity of the methanolic leaf extract of Murraya exotica (L.) (MEE). The study also evaluated the subacute toxicity study and the antipyretic activity of MEE on baker’s yeast-induced hyperthermia in rodent models. Results. Murraya exotica (L.) extract demonstrated curative antimalarial activity, with a percentage suppression of 45.84, 64.32±0.33, 56.74±2.16, and 64.61±0.67 at doses of 50, 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg, respectively. In the Peters 4-day suppressive test, MEE at dose 600 mg/kg had the highest chemosuppression (76.02±1.38%) compared with artesunate (2 mg/kg, p.o.) (82.56±0.97%). Subacute oral toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats documented no deaths, with no significant changes in clinical signs, organ weights, and hematological and biochemical parameters. The LD50 of MEE was estimated to be above 1000 mg/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats. All doses of MEE and paracetamol reduced pyrexia in 1 h and 2 h after their administration. The percentage reduction of rectal temperature (TR) for the positive control (paracetamol, 150 mg/kg, p.o.) was 44.36% while the Murraya exotica extract at doses 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 600 mg/kg recorded 67.74%, 40.78%, 66.42%, and 59.42%, respectively. Murraya exotica at dose 100 mg/kg exhibited significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) in baker’s yeast-induced pyrexia. Conclusions. The findings in this study show the antipyretic, curative, and suppressive antiplasmodial activity as well as the safety of the methanolic leaf extract of Murraya exotica (L.) supporting its traditional use for malaria and fever.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In view of the shortcomings in the risk assessment of deep-buried tunnels, a dynamic risk assessment method based on a Bayesian network is proposed. According to case statistics, a total of 12 specific risk rating factors are obtained and divided into three types: objective factors, subjective factors, and monitoring factors. The grading criteria of the risk rating factors are determined, and a dynamic risk rating system is established. A Bayesian network based on this system is constructed by expert knowledge and historical data. The nodes in the Bayesian network are in one-to-one correspondence with the three types of influencing factors, and the probability distribution is determined. Posterior probabilistic and sensitivity analyses are carried out, and the results show that the main influencing factors obtained by the two methods are basically the same. The constructed dynamic risk assessment model is most affected by the objective factor rating and monitoring factor rating, followed by the subjective factor rating. The dynamic risk rating is mainly affected by the surrounding rock level among the objective factors, construction management among the subjective factors, and arch crown convergence and side wall displacement among the monitoring factors. The dynamic risk assessment method based on the Bayesian network is applied to the No. 3 inclined shaft of the Humaling tunnel. According to the adjustment of the monitoring data and geological conditions, the dynamic risk rating probability of level I greatly decreased from 81.7% to 33.8%, the probability of level II significantly increased from 12.3% to 34.0%, and the probability of level III increased from 5.95% to 32.2%, which indicates that the risk level has risen sharply. The results show that this method can effectively predict the risk level during tunnel construction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The photovoltaic DC microgrid has strong nonlinearity and time variation. Therefore, traditional dual closed-loop control strategy of voltage and current based on PI controller cannot effectively restrain the fluctuation and impact of DC bus voltage when the dynamic response of the system is improved. Under this situation, in this paper, the fuzzy-PI dual-mode controller is designed to upgrade the traditional dual closed-loop control, taking voltage outer ring into consideration, which is adopted to achieve good transient performance while the bus voltage deviation is large. While the bus voltage deviation is small, the PI controller is utilized for good steady-state performance. Hence, simulation and experimental results show that the fuzzy-PI dual-mode controller has the same advantages with both fuzzy control and PI control; in other words, it has the features of speedy response, low overshoot, good robustness, and strong anti-interference under different working conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A bounded Hilbert space operator T is hyponormal if T∗T−TT∗ is a positive operator. We consider the hyponormality of Toeplitz operators on a weighted Bergman space. We find a necessary condition for hyponormality in the case of a symbol of the form f+g¯ where f and g are bounded analytic functions on the unit disk. We then find sufficient conditions when f is a monomial.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The liquid phase maldistribution factor has been investigated in trickle bed reactor, and the results are compared with the previous measurement data from literature by using the Electrical Resistance Tomography. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental results to some degree. The flow rates and particle sizes have been simulated with the method of multiphase flow. There are two different particles with average diameters of 3.4 mm and 5.3 mm. The flow rate has been studied ranging from 100 ml/min to 1100 ml/min. It has been found that the changes of the particles and liquid flow rates have a significant impact on the distribution of the liquid volume fraction. The internal liquid holdup is more serious, and the wall-flow phenomenon is more obvious in a bigger flow rate. The prediction of the liquid volume fraction distribution is a key research technique. Regression predictions have also been researched on the section near outlet, which can predict the internal flow state of the trickle bed under the condition of high temperature and high pressure. The average liquid volume fraction is linear with flow rates. The maldistribution factor is the index correlation with the flow rates. The results and main conclusions can be used to predict the distributions and get the properties in a trickle bed reactor.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. There is a limited diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, the noninvasive assessments are worth exploring. We determined the associations of phase angles (PhAs) obtained from bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) with the risk of NAFLD in an overweight population. Methods. A study involving 953 overweight participants was conducted in Wuhan city, China. The associations between PhAs (right arm, left arm, body trunk, right leg, left leg, and whole body) and the risk of NAFLD were conducted using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The associations of PhAs with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), a noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis and fibrosis, were also evaluated by both linear and logistic regression analyses. Results. The PhA values of the whole body, trunk, and legs were significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) in the NAFLD group than the non-NAFLD group. After adjustment for BMI, gender, education, income/year, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, passive smoking, and drinking, significant associations of PhA values of the right leg, left leg, and whole body with the risk of NAFLD were observed. In addition, the PhA of the right leg, left leg, and whole body were significantly related to the CAP values. Further stratified analyses indicated that these associations were significant in the participants with BMI &lt;30, but not in the participants with BMI ≥30. Conclusions. PhAs might be effective indicators in the management of NAFLD among overweight people.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. It has been associated with an important morbimortality due to its complications and sometimes as a result of adverse events related to treatment. Insulin pump therapy (IPT) is one of the options used to control this disease and reduces one of the most frequent complication associated with treatment: hypoglycemia, which has also a great impact on life quality and clinical status of patients. Materials and Methods. A descriptive and retrospective study was performed including patients treated and followed by the department of endocrinology from a high-complexity university hospital in Cali, Colombia, between 2012 and 2017. Patients were on IPT and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): MiniMed Paradigm® Veo™ Insulin Pump (Medtronic®) and MiniMed 640G Insulin Pump-Enlite™ Sensor (Medtronic®). Presentation of hypoglycemia and variables associated with its development were evaluated. Results. 51 patients were included. The main indication for IPT initiation was the report of hypoglycemic episodes and inappropriate metabolic control. Initiation of IPT was related with a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and also a decrease in severe hypoglycemic events and hospitalization due to hypoglycemia. The risk factors linked with clinically significant hypoglycemia were male gender, and standard deviation of glucose measures calculated by CGM. A diminished glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was correlated with higher risk of severe hypoglycemia. Conclusion. IPT with CGM is a useful strategy in the management of patients with DM; it is associated with a reduction of adverse hypoglycemic events and hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Load is one of the main causes of structural failure, and the correlation among loads would affect the evaluation results of structural performance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of the correlation among multiple loads on the structural reliability. In this paper, the nonparametric kernel density estimation (NKDE) method is used to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of related loads. In addition, the mixed copula (M-Copula) model is proposed, which combines Gumbel copula, Frank copula, Clayton copula, and weight coefficient, and the model parameters are fitted by MATLAB software to get the correlation of related loads. The reliability based on the related load combination is calculated according to the constructed model. After analyzing three numerical cases, the results show that the probability characteristics of NKDE estimation are very close to the actual conditions, and the reliability calculated by the M-Copula model is larger than those calculated by JCSS, Turkstra, and Gong methods. Using the M-Copula model for load correlation would avoid underestimating the reliability of the structure, which is conducive to structural economic development.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shiying Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The construction of vertex-disjoint paths (disjoint paths) is an important research topic in various kinds of interconnection networks, which can improve the transmission rate and reliability. The k-ary n-cube is a family of popular networks. In this paper, we determine that there are m2≤m≤n disjoint paths in 3-ary n-cube covering Qn3−F from S to T (many-to-many) with F≤2n−2m and from s to T (one-to-many) with F≤2n−m−1 where s is in a fault-free cycle of length three.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper introduces ClothFace, a shirtsleeve-integrated human-technology interface platform, which comprises two wrist antennas and three radio frequency identification (RFID) integrated circuits (ICs), each with a unique ID. The platform prototype, which is created on a shirtsleeve by cutting the antennas and antenna-IC interconnections from copper tape, can be used for push button and swipe controlling. Each IC can be activated, i.e., electrically connected to the two antennas, by touching the IC. These ICs can act as wireless input buttons to the technology around us. Due to the used passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) RFID technology, there is no need for clothing-integrated energy sources, but the interface platform gets all the needed energy from an external RFID reader. The platform prototype was found to be readable with an external RFID reader from all directions at distances of 70–80 cm. Further, seven people giving altogether 1400 inputs tested the prototype sleeves on a table and on body. In these first tests, 96–100% (table) and 92–100% (on-body) success rates were achieved in a gamelike testing setup. Further, the platform was proved to be readable with an off-the-shelf handheld RFID reader from a distance of 40 cm. Based on these initial results, this implementation holds the potential to be used as a touch interface blended into daily clothing, as well as a modular touch-based interaction platform that can be integrated into the surfaces of electronic devices, such as home appliances.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, we investigated the sliding mode control (SMC) technology for the spacecraft rendezvous maneuver under unknown system parameters and external disturbance. With no knowledge of the mass and inertial matrix of the pursuer spacecraft, an adaptive SMC approach was devised using the hyperbolic tangent function to realize the control objective of reducing the chattering problem. In addition, the finite-time stability of the relative dynamics and the boundedness of the signals in the closed-loop system were derived under proposed method. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method were verified through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Sahar Mohammadzadeh Osalu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hamzeh Shakib</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this research, the probabilistic seismic performance of asymmetric reinforced concrete wall-frame buildings with different strength distributions incorporating foundation flexibility effects is examined. By using probability-based performance evaluation approach, it is possible to provide a more accurate prediction of the different strength distribution effect on the seismic performance of asymmetric buildings and find the most efficient strength distribution for meeting each performance level. These efficient distributions can be adopted in the performance-based design of asymmetric buildings. For this purpose, first, the regression analysis and the concepts of efficiency and sufficiency were used to determine an optimal intensity measure (IM) for incremental dynamic analysis and evaluating the seismic response of the considered building models. Then, the proper magnitude of interstory drift capacity for this type of buildings in each limit state was estimated using the damage index concept. Finally, the effects of different strength distributions and the flexibility of foundation were studied on the seismic performance of the asymmetric buildings by investigating the mean annual frequencies of exceeding structural performance levels and confidence levels to satisfy performance objectives. It is concluded that irregular distributions of stiffness and strength in the plan of a building highly affect the seismic performance of buildings. Also, the results show that the optimum strength distribution is a function of the objective performance level and these optimum strength distributions are the same for both fixed- and flexible-base conditions. Meanwhile, the flexible effect of foundation increases the mean annual frequencies of exceedance within the range of 10% to 45% and significantly decreases the confidence levels in most cases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Patients after a high-velocity motor vehicle collision with rapid deceleration are at a significant risk of blunt aortic injury, a life-threatening condition that usually occurs in the aortic isthmus. Aortic transection is the second leading cause of death behind head injury for individuals aged 4 to 34. During the last two decades, there has been a shift from open towards the endovascular repair. Significant progress has been made recently in terms of the design of both the stent graft and the delivery system. We herein present the case of a female patient under dual antiplatelet therapy for coronary artery disease, with type IV blunt aortic injury (rupture) that was successfully repaired with Conformable Thoracic Endograft with Active Control System. This new device provides an intermediate deployment step at 50% and optional angulation control of the proximal part of the stent graft. These improvements are beneficial providing accurate device placement and maximum seal length in anatomies where the distal, as well as a proximal landing zone, is critical.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to protect user privacy or guarantee free access to the Internet, the network covert channel has become a hot research topic. It refers to an information channel in which the messages are covertly transmitted under the network environment. In recent years, many new construction schemes of network covert channels are proposed. But at the same time, network covert channel has also received the attention of censors, leading to many attacks. The network covert channel refers to an information channel in which the messages are covertly transmitted under the network environment. Many users exploit the network covert channel to protect privacy or guarantee free access to the Internet. Previous construction schemes of the network covert channel are based on information steganography, which can be divided into CTCs and CSCs. In recent years, there are some covert channels constructed by changing the transmission network architecture. On the other side, some research work promises that the characteristics of emerging network may better fit the construction of the network covert channel. In addition, the covert channel can also be constructed by changing the transmission network architecture. The proxy and anonymity communication technology implement this construction scheme. In this paper, we divide the key technologies for constructing network covert channels into two aspects: communication content level (based on information steganography) and transmission network level (based on proxy and anonymity communication technology). We give an comprehensively summary about covert channels at each level. We also introduce work for the three new types of network covert channels (covert channels based on streaming media, covert channels based on blockchain, and covert channels based on IPv6). In addition, we present the attacks against the network covert channel, including elimination, limitation, and detection. Finally, the challenge and future research trend in this field are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Since there is no consistent evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment, this review aims to summarize and critically evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews (SRs). Methods. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM), and Wanfang databases from the date of establishment to April 2019. Two authors independently selected the articles, collected the data, and assessed the identified and included SRs with the revised measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (AMSTAR 2) and preferred reporting items for SRs and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The quality of outcomes was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results. Eleven SRs were included in this overview. The items of AMSTAR 2 in most SRs were poorly reported; only 3 SRs were rated as low quality by AMSTAR 2, and the remaining were rated as very low quality. A total of 8 SRs obtained a decent rating by PRISMA. With the GRADE tool, we have not found high-quality evidence that acupuncture is effective for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), so there is no certain conclusion on the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for MCI. Conclusion. The methodological and reporting quality of SRs on acupuncture for MCI is substandard, and the quality of evidence is poor. In future research, more efforts are needed to improve the quality of SRs in this field.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shahriar Afandizadeh</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shahab Hassanpour</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As roadway and development factors are identified as the most effective factors contributing to road traffic accidents, investigating these factors could lead to reducing the accident frequency rate. However, previous works focused on investigating the effect of roadway factors on the accident frequency rate using statistical analysis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of roadway and development factors on the accident frequency rate using ANOVA and Chi-square tests on a rural road. Secondly, it aimed to develop a rural road safety risk index based on K-means clustering and Gaussian models. The findings indicated that the operating speed and the differences between posted speed limits and the operating speed are the pivotal influencing factors on the accident frequency rate. Moreover, clustering analysis of the roadway and development factors on the two-lane, two-way road of Borujerd-Khorramabad indicated six clusters which were identified as highly, relatively highly, moderately, relatively lowly, lowly risky, and not risky (safe) clusters. Regarding clusters, the accident frequency rate increased by decreasing the difference between the posted speed limits and the operating speed from the safe cluster. In addition, the risky index model based on the Gaussian model showed that the average reducing factor of accident frequency rate reached 0.99 by increasing per km/hr in the difference between the posted speed limits and the operating speed among low risky and safe clusters, while it was equal to 1.17 in risky and unsafe clusters. The comparison of the clusters revealed that accident occurrence probability in risky clusters was more than the ones in low risky or safe clusters. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values of the safety risk index were observed in the sixth and the third clusters, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inflammatory bowel disease, a gut disease that is prevalent worldwide, is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, such as colitis, and disorder of the gut microbiome. Glycine (Gly) is the simplest amino acid and functions as an anti-inflammatory immune-nutrient and intestinal microbiota regulator. This study aimed at investigating the effect of Gly on colitis induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 5% acetic acid (AA). Bodyweight and survival rates were monitored, and colonic length and weight, serum amino acid concentrations, intestinal inflammation-related gene expression, and colonic microbiota abundances were analyzed. The results showed that Gly dietary supplementation had no effect on the survival rate or the ratio of colonic length to weight. However, Gly supplementation reversed the AA-induced increase in serum concentrations of amino acids such as glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Furthermore, Gly inhibited colonic gene expression of interleukin- (IL-) 1β and promoted IL-10 expression in colitis mice. Gly supplementation also reversed the AA-induced reduction in the abundance of bacteria such as Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiales. This change in the intestinal microbiota was possibly attributable to the changes in colonic IL-10 expression and serum concentrations of valine and leucine. In sum, Gly supplementation regulated the serum concentrations of amino acids, the levels of colonic immune-associated gene expression, and the intestinal microbiota in a mouse model of colitis. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of Gly in regulating metabolism, intestinal immunity, and the gut microbiota in animals afflicted with colitis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Given the growing evidence of a link between gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis and multiple sclerosis (MS), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aimed at rebuilding GM, has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach to MS treatment. To evaluate the viability of FMT for MS treatment and its impact on MS pathology, we tested FMT in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We provide evidence that FMT can rectify altered GM to some extent with a therapeutic effect on EAE. We also found that FMT led to reduced activation of microglia and astrocytes and conferred protection on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), myelin, and axons in EAE. Taken together, our data suggest that FMT, as a GM-based therapy, has the potential to be an effective treatment for MS.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ali Akbar Oroojan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Glucose homeostasis is required for control of insulin secretion. Phenolic compounds improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Eugenol is a phenolic compound that may increase GSIS. So, it was decided to investigate the effect of eugenol on the insulin secretion and content of pancreatic islets from the male mice. In this experimental study, 3-month-old NMRI mice (20–25 g) were prepared. The pancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated using the collagenase digestion method and divided into 12 groups: glucose 2.8, 5.6, and 16.7 mM, glucose 2.8 mM + eugenol 50, 100, and 200 µM, glucose 5.6 mM + eugenol 50, 100, and 200 µM, and glucose 16.7 mM + eugenol 50, 100, and 200 µM. The islet’s insulin secretion and content were measured after 1 hour and 24 hours incubation at 37°C, respectively, by the ELISA assays method and related commercial kit. Present results showed that all doses of eugenol increased islet’s insulin secretion and content in the medium containing glucose concentrations 2.8, 5.6, and 16.7 mM (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, eugenol as a phenolic compound increased insulin secretion and content of pancreatic islets. The moderate dose of this compound enhanced insulin secretion during hypo- and hyperglycemic conditions, as well as a high dose of eugenol, increased insulin content. Finally, present research suggested that the administration of eugenol 100 µM was suitable for the early stage of T2DM as well as eugenol 200 µM for the advanced stage of this disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Asphalt pavement subjected to heavy traffic load and harsh environmental conditions can easily build up damage and shorten the service life. In this paper, different dosages of basalt fiber (BF) were introduced into crumb rubber (CR) modified asphalt binder, and a series of laboratory tests were carried out to evaluate the properties and performances. A dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) was employed to evaluate viscosity and rheological properties. Bending beam rheometer (BBR) test and direct tensile test (DTT) were conducted to test the low temperature property. Cone penetration was designed to test shear strength. Results show that the optimum content of BF is 0.3% by the weight of asphalt binder based on the overall performance evaluation. Viscosity, complex modulus, fatigue property, rutting resistance, and shear strength are improved by introducing BF into asphalt binder. Stiffness and elasticity are also increased. BBR indicates that ductility at low temperature is reduced a little by the presence of BF, but DTT shows that both tensile strength and elongation are improved by BF. Considering that DTT is more performance related, DTT is preferred over BBR to evaluate cracking potentials at low temperatures of asphalt binder modified with CR and BF. Finally, it is revealed through microscale scanning that three mechanisms, absorption of asphalt binder, 3-dimensional fiber network, and bridging effects, contribute to the performance improvement of asphalt binder modified with CR and BF.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Beishan granite is a potential host rock for a high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository in China. Understanding the hydromechanical (HM) behavior and permeability evolution of Beishan granite is important for the HLW repository safety. Therefore, the granite of Beishan in Gansu province was studied. HM coupled tests are carried out on Beishan granite under different pore pressures. The results show that the initial pressure difference has little influence on permeability measurement before dilatancy starts. However, after onset of dilatancy, the permeability increases with the increasing initial pressure difference. The initial permeability of Beishan granite is about 10−18 m2 under a confining pressure of 20 MPa. In the initial loading phase, the permeability shows a relatively large reduction. Then, the permeability almost keeps constant until dilatancy starts. From dilatancy point to peak stress, permeability increases linearly with volumetric strain. The proposed permeability evolution rule is implemented into a numerical code to perform HM coupled simulations. The simulation results show that the damaged zone first appears at the model boundary and then extends to the inside, forming high volumetric strain areas. And it provides seepage channels for fluid flow. The macroscopic fracture patterns indicate that pore pressure accelerates rock degradation during HM coupling. The obtained results help to understand the damage mechanisms of granite caused by pore pressures and are of great importance for the safety of a HLW repository.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on the seismic isolation design concept of functional separation, a seismic isolation system with bearings and braces combination for railway bridge was proposed. The sliding bearings afford the vertical loads, and the self-centering energy dissipation brace (SCED) and buckling restrained brace (BRB) control the horizontal displacement of the beam, so the functional separation was achieved under the combined action. Taking a long-span railway continuous beam-arch bridge as an example, the corresponding analysis model was established to study lateral seismic response and the girder’s displacement pattern of the continuous beam-arch bridge under the earthquake excitations. The seismic response of bridges with different seismic isolation schemes was studied. The result showed that the presence of arch rib in a continuous beam-arch bridge amplifies the transverse displacement response of the girder compared with that in a continuous beam bridge of equal mass. The seismic isolation system with sliding bearings and energy dissipation braces can control the relative displacement between the pier and beam greatly, and the SCED can reduce or even eliminate the residual displacement between pier and beam. Furthermore, under the strong ground motions, the combined use of SCED and BRB can achieve the seismic isolation to the maximum extent when the self-centering force ratio ζ, the ratio of self-centering force to superstructure weight, is 0.074.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Bandar Almaslukh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Optical burst switching (OBS) networks are frequently compromised by attackers who can flood the networks with burst header packets (BHPs), causing a denial of service (DoS) attack, also known as a BHP flooding attack. Nowadays, a set of machine learning (ML) methods have been embedded into OBS core switches to detect these BHP flooding attacks. However, due to the redundant features of BHP data and the limited capability of OBS core switches, the existing technology still requires major improvements to work effectively and efficiently. In this paper, an efficient and effective ML-based security approach is proposed for detecting BHP flooding attacks. The proposed approach consists of a feature selection phase and a classification phase. The feature selection phase uses the information gain (IG) method to select the most important features, enhancing the efficiency of detection. For the classification phase, a decision tree (DT) classifier is used to build the model based on the selected features of BHPs, reducing the overfitting problem and improving the accuracy of detection. A set of experiments are conducted on a public dataset of OBS networks using 10-fold cross-validation and holdout techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved the highest possible classification accuracy of 100% by using only three features.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Heavy rainfall events, typically associated with tropical cyclones (TCs), provoke intense flooding, consequently causing severe losses to life and property. Therefore, the amount and distribution of rain associated with TCs must be forecasted precisely within a reasonable time to guarantee the protection of lives and goods. In this study, the skill of the Numerical Tool for Hurricane Forecast (NTHF) for determining rainfall pattern, average rainfall, rainfall volume, and extreme amounts of rain observed during TCs is evaluated against Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data. A sample comprising nine systems formed in the North Atlantic basin from 2016 to 2018 is used, where the analysis begins 24 h before landfall. Several statistical indices characterising the abilities of the NTHF and climatology and persistence model for rainfalls (R-CLIPER) for forecasting rain as measured by the TRMM are calculated at 24, 48, and 72 h forecasts for each TC and averaged. The model under consideration presents better forecasting skills than the R-CLIPER for all the attributes evaluated and demonstrates similar performances compared with models reported in the literature. The proposed model predicts the average rainfall well and presents a good description of the rain pattern. However, its forecast of extreme rain is only applicable for 24 h.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. This study constructed a model for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer by comparing the serum peptides profiles of patients with advanced gastric cancer and healthy people. And that model may be the potential to be applied for the efficacy evaluation and recurrence monitoring in gastric cancer. Methods. Serums of 30 healthy people and 30 advanced gastric cancer patients were matched by age and gender were collected. The serum peptide spectrum was obtained by MB-WCX concentration and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Based on the analysis of the efficiency of differential peptides in the diagnosis of gastric cancer, we first established a model for the diagnosis of gastric cancer based on differential peptides and then carried out external verification. The diagnostic reliability of this model was further tested by compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Results. In this present study, we found the expression of two peptide peaks with a molecular weight of 2863 Da and 2953 Da were significantly increased in gastric cancer serum, while the expression of two peptide peaks with a molecular weight of 1945 Da and 2082 Da were significantly decreased. Depending on the characteristics of peptide expression, we constructed a diagnostic model, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the model established by 2953 Da/1945 Da, and found this model is significantly higher than CEA and CA19-9. Conclusion. There were some differences in serum peptides profiles between patients with advanced gastric cancer and healthy people. The serum peptide diagnostic models based on 2953 Da and 1945 Da have high diagnostic efficiency for advanced gastric cancer. Our result indicated that this model was well worth further validation for clinical diagnosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is well known that the interbank market is able to effectively provide financial liquidity for the entire banking system and maintain the stability of the financial market. In this paper, we develop an innovative complex network approach to simulate an interbank network with systemic risk contagion that takes into account the balance sheet of each bank, from which we can identify if the financial institutions have sufficient capital reserves to prevent risk contagion. Cascading defaults are also generated in the simulation according to different crisis-triggering (targeted defaults) methods. We also use machine learning techniques to identify the synthetic features of the network. Our analysis shows that the topological factors and market factors in the interbank network have significant impacts on the risk spreading. Overall, this paper provides a scientific method for policy-makers to select the optimal management policy for handling systemic risk.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Video surveillance is an effective way to record current events. In view of the difficulty of efficient transmission of massive surveillance video and the risk of leakage in the transmission process, a new data encryption and fast transmission algorithm is proposed in this paper. From the perspective of events, the constraints of time and space dimension is broken. First, a background and moving object extraction model is built based on video composition. Then, a strong correlation data encryption and fast transmission model is constructed to achieve efficient data compression. Finally, a data mapping mechanism is established to realize the decoding of surveillance video. Our experimental results show that the compression ratio of the proposed algorithm is more than 60% under the premise of image confidentiality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The propagation of rumor has become a common phenomenon in social networks. Studying the dynamic propagation of rumor can help locate the key points to control rumor propagation. To further research the internal motivation of state transition, a corrector-ignorant-spreader-weakener (C-SIW) model is proposed in this paper. When the individual changes state to transmit rumor, the neighbor may have a significant impact on rumor propagation. Considering the point, this paper constructs a function to describe the propagation rate, which relates to the state of neighbors and the reputation of the spreader. In addition, perception from life also can cause individual state changes. Based on the above fact, the links from the spreader and the weakener to the corrector are added to describe the perception mechanism. Then, combining the derived average field equations, the steady state of the model is analyzed and verified in experimental simulation. Moreover, the experimental results on different networks show that the perception mechanism reduces the rumor influence. Besides, the variable propagation rate can position the fast-growing stage of rumor propagation more accurately and facilitate the control of rumor propagation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study aimed to investigate the effects of the coadministration of budesonide (Bud) and the extracts of Epimedii Folium and Ligustri Lucidi Fructus (EEL) on regulating apoptosis and autophagy in asthmatic rats. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into five groups (8 rats in each group): normal control (control), asthma model (asthma), Bud (1 mg Bud suspension in 50 ml sterile physiological saline for 30 min), EEL (100 mg/kg EEL), and group of coadministration of Bud and EEL (Bud&amp;EEL, 100 mg/kg EEL plus Bud by nebulized inhalation for 30 min). Rats were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin for 7 weeks and treated with corresponding drug for 4 weeks. We anesthetized all rats with 25% ethyl carbamate (4 ml/kg) and took lung tissues and BALF after final ovalbumin challenge to observe the lung histopathology and morphometry; apoptosis in BALF and lung tissue; protein expressions of Ki-67, α-SMA, cleaved Caspase-3, p-mTOR, and LC3; and protein and mRNA expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, P53, mTOR, and Beclin-1. Results showed that Bud&amp;EEL could alleviate airway remodeling, inhibit cell proliferation and autophagy in lung tissue, and promote apoptosis in BALF and lung tissue in ovalbumin-induced asthma rats through downregulating the protein expressions of α-SMA and Ki-67, the protein ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and Bcl-2/Bax, and the protein and mRNA expressions of Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, while upregulating the protein expressions of cleaved Caspase-3 and p-mTOR, and the protein and mRNA expressions of Bax, Caspase-3, P53, and mTOR. Bud&amp;EEL had better effects than single-use Bud on improving airway remodeling, promoting apoptosis, and regulating the expressions of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins. This study suggested that the effects of coadministration of EEL and Bud on regulating apoptosis and autophagy were better than those of single-use Bud treatment, and that might be the mechanism of attenuating airway remodeling, providing an alternative therapy for asthma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of trichomoniasis. The genetic characterisation of T. vaginalis isolates reveals significant genetic diversity in this organism. Data on the prevalence of different genotypes of T. vaginalis in South African populations is lacking. This study investigated the diversity of T. vaginalis in a pregnant population in South Africa. Methods. In this study, 362 pregnant women from the King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban, South Africa, provided vaginal swabs to be tested for the presence of T. vaginalis. T. vaginalis was detected using the TaqMan assay using commercially available primers and probes specific for this protozoan (Pr04646256_s1). The actin gene from T. vaginalis was amplified with gene-specific primers. The actin amplicons were digested with HindII, MseI, and RsaI, and the banding patterns were compared across the three digests for assignment of genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA. Results. The prevalence of T. vaginalis in the study population was 12.9% (47/362). Genotype G was the most frequent genotype in our study population. Genotypes H and I were detected in one sample each. According to the multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis, a level of diversity was observed across and within genotypes. Four different single-nucleotide changes in the actin gene were detected. Sample TV358 (H genotype) contained a single amino acid substitution from glutamine to lysine. Sample TV184 (G genotype) contained a single amino acid substitution from glutamic acid to arginine. Sample TV357 (G genotype) contained two amino acid substitutions, arginine to leucine and glycine to aspartic acid. Conclusion. Three different genotypes were observed in the pregnant population. Diversity was observed across and within genotypes. The observed diversity can be challenging for future vaccine design and development of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To investigate whether icariin (ICA), a well-known medicine extracted from the stem and leaf of Epimedium brevicornum Maxim, had analgesic effect on lower back pain (LBP) in rats. Methods. In a puncture-induced LBP rat model, the severity of LBP was quantified using the paw/foot withdrawal threshold method after intragastric administration of ICA at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/d or 100 mg/kg/d. The pain-related peptides of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were also measured in intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue using RT-PCR after ICA treatment. In addition, the expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) in IVD was quantified using RT-PCR and ELISA examination. Results. ICA treatment resulted in a significant amelioration of mechanical allodynia in a dose-response manner, and the analgesic effect could last for two weeks even during the washout period. More importantly, the mechanism of analgesic pharmacological effect in ICA was to suppress the upregulated CINC-1, the homolog of IL-8 in rats, which is a crucial proalgesic factor contributing to LBP, in IVDs. Conclusion. ICA is a novel herbal extract to relieve LBP, and it may be a promising alternative pain killer in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jun Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Da-Yong Luo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Stochastic neural network has the characteristics of good global convergence and fast gradient-based learning ability. It can be applied to multidimensional nonlinear systems, but its generalization ability is poor. In this paper, combined with rule base, through the PCA method, an improved multimodal variable-structure random-vector neural network algorithm (MM-P-VSRVNN) is proposed for coagulant dosing, which is a key production process in water purification process. Ensuring for qualified water, how to control coagulation dosage effectively, obtain valid production cost, and increase more profits is a focus in the water treatment plan. Different with the normal neural network mode, PCA is used to optimize hidden-layer nodes and update the neural network structure at every computation. This method rectifies coagulant dosage effectively while keeping valid coagulation performance. By the way, the MM-P-VSRVNN algorithm can decrease computation time and avoid overfitting learning ability. Finally, the method is proved feasible through the experiment and analyzed by the simulation result.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xiaoling Liang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Duansong Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper presents the platoon formation control design for unmanned surface vehicles with input and output constraints. First, Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is employed to ensure the desired line-of-sight (LOS) range. The LOS range should be maintained within the predefined regions between each marine vehicle and its predecessor while the connected platoons track the trajectory. Next, to handle the model uncertainties and unknown external disturbance, we propose an adaptive neural network controller that approximates the unknown nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Nussbaum function is applied to compensate for input saturations. In addition, formation errors can be guaranteed by stability analysis. The distance between two consecutive agents does not violate collision avoidance and connectivity in the presence of input saturation. Finally, the feasibility of the theoretical results is illustrated through the simulation results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Large-scale engineering projects make tremendous contributions to China’s social and economic development; meanwhile, due to the diversity of stakeholders, the dispersion of time and space, and the complexity of information dissemination, large-scale engineering projects are easy to cause conflicts among stakeholders that affect social stability. The previous studies on stakeholder conflicts of large-scale engineering projects mainly focused on the game model among stakeholders, without considering the influence of stakeholders’ interaction complex networks formed by social relations on the conflict amplification. For the two main stakeholders of the government and the resident that play a key role in China’s large-scale engineering projects, this paper constructs an evolutionary game model of the main stakeholder conflict amplification and analyzes the evolutionary results of the conflict between the government and the resident in different situations. The small-world network is chosen as the complex network type of the simulation study since it is very similar with the topology of the realistic social network. Based on the NetLogo simulation platform, the stakeholder conflict amplification process of large-scale engineering projects on the small-world network is analyzed, and relevant management measures are proposed to defuse the stakeholder conflict of large-scale engineering projects. By using the evolutionary game model on complex networks, this paper studies the stakeholder conflict on the small-world network, providing reference for stakeholder conflict management of large-scale engineering projects in China.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lung cancer has the highest mortality of any cancer worldwide, and cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer treatment. Unfortunately, cisplatin resistance is a common cause of therapeutic failure. The ability to overcome chemoresistance is crucial to the effective treatment of lung cancer. Recently, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a type of polyphenol extracted from tea, has been shown to suppress the rapid proliferation of cancer cells, including lung cancer. We tested whether nanoparticles (NPs) carrying a dual drug load, cisplatin and EGCG, could overcome chemoresistance to cisplatin, by working together to kill lung cancer cells. Self-assembling gelatin/EGCG nanoparticles (GE) were synthesized, and cisplatin was then incorporated, to construct a dual drug nanomedicine (EGCG/cisplatin-loaded gelatin nanoparticle, named as GE-Pt NP). The particle size and zeta potential were examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The morphological structure of GE-Pt NPs was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro testing was performed using a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549). A cytotoxicity examination was performed, using a WST-8 cell proliferation assay. Intracellular cisplatin content was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In conclusion, we successfully prepared GE-Pt NPs, as spherical structures, approximately 75 nm in diameter, with a positive charge (+19.83±0.25 mV). The encapsulation rate of cisplatin in GE-Pt was about 63.7%, and the EGCG loading rate was around 89%. A relatively low concentration of GE-Pt NPs (EGCG 5 μg/mL : cisplatin 2 μg/mL) exhibited significant cytotoxicity, compared to cisplatin alone. The GE-Pt NPs are freely taken up by cells via endocytosis, raising the intracellular cisplatin concentration to a therapeutic level. We consider that combination therapy of cisplatin and EGCG in nanoparticles (GE-Pt NPs) may help overcome cisplatin resistance and could effectively be used in the treatment of lung cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Taibai Xu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yaoming Li</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The threshing and cleaning device in the grain combine harvester is located in the same airtight space, and the air flow field in it should also be studied and tested as a whole system. In order to study the distribution of air flow field and the influence of working parameters on the air flow field in the internal space of threshing and cleaning system, the method of predicting harvest performance indexes (grain loss rate and grain impurity rate) by air flow field analysis was explored. First of all, taking the longitudinal grain combine harvester of our research group as the test object and taking the rotating speed of centrifugal fan, the angle of fan plate, the opening of chaffer, and the rotating speed of threshing cylinder as the research factors, the internal space flow channel model of threshing and cleaning system under different working conditions was established and CFD software was used to simulate and analyze the air flow field. At the same time, the hot wire anemometer is used to measure and verify the distribution of air flow field in the threshing and cleaning system under various working conditions. Then, the harvest performance index of the threshing and cleaning system under the rated feeding rate is tested under the corresponding working conditions to find the relationship between the distribution of air flow field and harvest performance, put forward the corresponding analysis and prediction methods, and establish the mathematical relationship model between the simulated air flow field and harvest performance index. The results of simulation and experiment show that the average air velocity can more accurately reflect the cleaning performance. The mathematical function of the relation curve is Y = 11.71X − 4.76, and the prediction error is within 9.4%. The air velocity in the middle area of the vibrating screen is approximately in proportion to the cleaning performance, which provides the theoretical and experimental basis for the design of the threshing and cleaning device and the adjustment of the working parameters in the field harvest. In addition, it can save the design time and cost and reduce the seasonal impact of field experiment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. This preliminary study is aimed at enriching and isolating peritoneal metastatic cancer stem cells (pMCSCs) of gastric cancer and assessing their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and invasiveness. Methods. Cancer stem cells of human gastric cancer (CSC-hGC) were previously isolated and transfected with green fluorescent protein and luciferase genes to validate the mouse model of peritoneal metastasis established via transplantation. The first and second generations ([G1] and [G2], respectively) of pMCSCs were isolated from intraperitoneally transplanted CSC-hGC (pMCSC-tGC) by spherical culture. CSC and EMT-related markers and regulators in the two generations of intraperitoneally transplanted tumors were examined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and quantitative PCR. Cell mobility was examined by a transwell assay. Results. The nude mouse model of intraperitoneally transplanted CSC-hGC was successful in establishing sequential formation of peritoneal tumors and enrichment of pMCSCs. CD44 and CD54 were consistently expressed in the two generations of transplanted tumors. In vitro cell (migration) assays and immunocytofluorescence assays showed that in pMCSC-tGC[G2], E-cad, Survivin, and Vimentin expression was stable; α-SMA expression was decreased; and OVOL2, GRHL2, and ZEB1 expression was increased. PCR analysis indicated that in pMCSC-tGC[G2], the mRNA expression of E-cad, α-SMA, MMP9, MMP2, and Vimentin was downregulated, while that of ZEB1, OVOL2, and GRHL2 was upregulated. In vivo tumor (homing) assays and immunohistochemical assays demonstrated that in pMCSC-tGC[G2], E-cad and Snail were upregulated, while α-SMA was downregulated. The numbers of migrated and invaded pMCSC-tGC[G1] and pMCSC-tGC[G2] were significantly higher than those of CSC-hGC in migration and invasion assays. Conclusions. pMCSCs might be a specific subpopulation that can be sequentially enriched by intraperitoneal transplantation. pMCSCs exhibited a tendency towards partial mesenchymal-epithelial transition, enhancing their invasiveness during homing and the formation of peritoneal tumors. However, these preliminary findings require validation in further experiments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Application of a horizontal section top-coal caving in a steeply inclined thick coal seam not only effectively resolves the problem of the large dip angle of the coal seam and slipping and dumping of mining equipment but also significantly reduces the tunnel drivage ratio and improves the extraction yield. In addition, it allows for a safe and efficient mining from a steeply inclined thick coal seam. In this paper, the roof fracture pattern of a steeply inclined thick coal seam has been studied by a similar simulation experiment. The results of the simulation are consistent with those of the numerical calculations, thus verifying the accuracy of the simulation. The experimental simulation results show that the roof can form a step-like toppling failure pattern after drawing the coal, and it is difficult to release a triangular coal mass near the floor, which is the main concentration area of coal loss. The numerical simulation results show that, with the excavation of the coal seam, the rock mass around the goaf produces plastic failure, and the damage is mainly concentrated in the roof area. The upper part of the goaf mainly shows a tensile failure, while the other areas mainly show yield failure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the increasing connectivity of modern vehicles, protecting systems from attacks on cyber is becoming crucial and urgent. Meanwhile, a vehicle should guarantee a safe and comfortable trip for users. Therefore, how to design a cybersecurity-critical system in vehicles with safety and user experience (UX) considerations is increasingly essential. However, most co-design methods focus on safety engineering with attack concerns and do not discuss conflicts and integration, and few contain the UX aspect. Besides, most existing approaches are abstract at a high level without practical guidelines. This paper presents a literature review of existing safety and security design approaches and proposes a systematic approach for cybersecurity design of in-vehicle network systems based on the guideline in SAE J3061. The trade-off analysis is performed by using association keys and the proposed affecting map. The design process of an example Diagnostic on Internet Protocol (DoIP) system is reported to show how the approach works. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed one considers safety, cybersecurity, and UX simultaneously, solves conflicts qualitatively or quantitatively, and obtains trade-off design requirements. This approach is applicable to the cybersecurity-driven design of in-vehicle network systems in the early stage with safety and UX considerations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Inflammation and the nutritional status of patients with GC are important factors affecting the therapeutic effect and prognosis. Inflammatory and nutrition-related markers have been shown to be prognostic factors for patients with GC. However, few studies have investigated the relationship of the prealbumin-to-globulin ratio (PGR) with the prognosis of GC patients. The objective of the present study was to examine whether pretreatment PGR is related to the prognosis and chemotherapy outcomes of in-patients with advanced GC undergoing first-line chemotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 281 patients with unresectable GC from January 2013 to January 2018. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the cut-off values for the PGR. The relationship between the PGR and chemotherapy effectiveness was evaluated using the chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier’s method was used to plot progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves, using multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify promising predictors of mortality. The cut-off value for the PGR was 7.21. The high-PGR (≥7.21) group had a higher disease control rate than that of the low-PGR group (93.66% vs. 78.42%, p&lt;0.001). Kaplan-Meier’s analysis showed significantly higher median PFS (189 vs. 125 days, p&lt;0.001) and OS (350 vs. 288 days, p&lt;0.001) in the high-PGR group. The multivariate analyses revealed that a high PGR is an independent protective factor in patients with advanced GC, both in terms of PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.672; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.527–0.857; p&lt;0.001) and OS (HR: 0.675; 95% CI: 0.530–0.861; p=0.002). In conclusion, the prechemotherapy PGR can accurately predict the chemotherapy outcome, PFS, and OS of patients with advanced GC. Therefore, medical practitioners can utilize the PGR as a novel dependable prognostic tool to weigh the prognosis of patients with GC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Titanium dioxide (TD) and graphene oxide (GO) were synthesized by sol-gel and improved Hummers method, respectively. This study shows the results of the incorporation through four different conditions (sol-gel, sol-gel and ultrasonic, annealed, and UV radiation, C1 to C4, respectively). It was observed that a homogeneous incorporation of TD on sheets of GO was obtained satisfactorily. The composites of TiO2/GO were characterized using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The photocatalytic activity of the composites was determined from the degradation of the dye azo tartrazine using UV and solar radiation. The best incorporation of TD nanoparticles on GO was obtained with condition C3 (thermal incorporation method) at a temperature of 65°C. This shows a uniformity in the size and shape of the TD as well as an excellent adherence to the sheet of GO. This addition is accomplished by ionic bonding in the presence of electrostatic Coulomb forces. The C3 composite degraded the tartrazine dye using UV radiation and sunlight. With the latter, the degradation time was three times faster than using UV light.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>James S. Chacha</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Henry S. Laswai</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background. Wild vegetables serve an important purpose in the health and diet of many people residing in the rural areas. Various traditional practices associated with their processing and consumption are uncommon and unknown to the present generation, resulting to their underutilization. Methods. Qualitative data were obtained through focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (KIIs), and participant observation. Using a checklist and questionnaire, a total of 120 individuals from 120 randomly selected households in Kilimanjaro and Morogoro regions were interviewed. Results. Underutilised indigenous vegetables from Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions were investigated. Out of 40 vegetables, four underutilised vegetables (UVs), Sunga (Launea cornuta), Kikundembala (Vigna vexillata), Mokiki (Momordica foetida), and Inyiri (Basella alba), were identified, collected, and studied. Over 75% of respondents preferred UVs to exotic species, the likes of cabbage, amaranth, eggplant, pumpkin leaves, and spinach. It was further noted that with the existing myths and fads associated with consumption of UVs, as well as the widespread use of the exotic vegetable species among the modern generation, UVs’ future demand is diminishing. Conclusion. There are many varieties of UVs in Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions. However, the UVs are currently showing decreasing demand due to various reasons including difficulties in preparation, low palatability, and negative image to consumers; introduction of exotic species of vegetables was found to further suppress the use of UVs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the risk assessment of water inrush in karst tunnel, it is most important to provide an available theoretical model for qualifying the epistemic uncertainties due to a lack of knowledge and information. Firstly, a mechanical model dependent on geology is introduced associating with four parameters, i.e., the elastic modulus E, the Poisson ratio μ, the water differential pressure q, and the tunnel radius a. Then, a mathematical model representing epistemic uncertainty is represented with probability theory and possibility theory. The methodology was computerized to calculate the distribution of the margin and uncertainty and then to determine the ratio of “margin/uncertainty.” Analyses involving possibility theory and possibility theory are illustrated with the same engineering example used in the presentation indicated above to illustrate the use of probability to represent aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in QMU analyses. The comparison between the uses of possibility theory and probability theory for the representation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty indicates that the possibility is not only has a better mathematical structure than probability theory but also has some challenges.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Nian-Chun Deng</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Peng-Fei Tang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>To increase the accuracy of the core-drilling method in measuring the in situ stresses within concrete beams, this paper developed a special core-drilling machine system, studied the surface stress release rule of concrete beams through finite element simulations, and then carried out verification tests. The effects of the borehole diameter, drilling depth, strain sensor size, and borehole position on the measurement accuracy were studied. The results showed that borehole diameters of 100 mm, 75 mm, and 50 mm can achieve stress release and that the smaller the borehole diameter was, the easier it was to release the stress. When using the smallest borehole, the stress concentration range around the borehole was narrow, and there was little damage to the original structure. The strain gauge size influenced the actual measurement results. An excessively large strain gauge will be disturbed by drilling because of the limited size of the borehole. An excessively small strain gauge will be easily influenced by the inhomogeneity and randomness of the concrete materials, resulting in large measurement error. The difference between the measured concrete stress and the theoretical value was less than 10%, and the average error was only 6.03%, indicating the feasibility of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally from its epicenter in Hubei, China, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The most popular search engine worldwide is Google, and since March 2020, COVID-19 has been a global trending search term. Misinformation related to COVID-19 from these searches is a problem, and hence, it is of high importance to assess the quality of health information over the internet related to COVID-19. The objective of our study is to examine the quality of COVID-19 related health information over the internet using the DISCERN tool. Methods. The keywords included in assessment of COVID-19 related information using Google’s search engine were “Coronavirus,” “Coronavirus causes,” “Coronavirus diagnosis,” “Coronavirus prevention,” and “Coronavirus management”. The first 20 websites from each search term were gathered to generate a list of 100 URLs. Duplicate sites were excluded from this search, allowing analysis of unique sites only. Additional exclusion criteria included scientific journals, nonoperational links, nonfunctional websites (where the page was not loading, was not found, or was inactive), and websites in languages other than English. This resulted in a unique list of 48 websites. Four independent raters evaluated the websites using a 16-item DISCERN tool to assess the quality of novel coronavirus related information available on the internet. The interrater reliability agreement was calculated using the intracluster correlation coefficient. Results. Results showed variation in how the raters assigned scores to different website categories. The .com websites received the lowest scores. Results showed that .edu and .org website category sites were excellent in communicating coronavirus related health information; however, they received lower scores for treatment effect and treatment choices. Conclusion. This study highlights the gaps in the quality of information that is available on the websites related to COVID-19 and study emphasizes the need for verified websites that provide evidence-based health information related to the novel coronavirus pandemic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Road networks are one of the vital components of a transportation system that influence the traffic capacity and disaster losses after the earthquakes. The road network reliability is crucial for the postearthquake emergency decision-making. In this study, a method is proposed to assess the seismic damage of road networks considering individual road damage state and reliability of road networks in emergency conditions. First, we assess the importance of the factors that affect seismic road damage using the AdaBoost algorithm. In addition, artificial neural networks are used to evaluate the damage state of an individual road based on the factors that are selected with higher importance. Then, the improved estimation for the reliability of road networks is adopted to assess the damage of road networks. Last, the method is demonstrated using the road networks in Karamay, China.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>R. M. Yuvaraj</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Land surface temperature (LST) is a key factor in numerous areas such as climate change, land use/land cover in the urban areas, and heat balance and is also a significant participant in the creation of climate models. Landsat data has given numerous possibilities to understand the land processes by means of remote sensing. The present study has been performed to identify the LST of the study region using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images for two time periods in order to compare the data. The study also attempted to identify and predict the role and importance of NDVI, NDBI, and the slope of the region on LST. The study concludes that the maximum and minimum temperatures of 40.44 C and 20.78 C were recorded during the November month whereas the maximum and minimum LST for month March has increased to 42.44 C and 24.57 C respectively. The result indicates that LST is inversely proportional to NDVI (−6.369) and slope (−0.077) whereas LST is directly proportional to NDBI (+14.74). Multiple linear regression model has been applied to calculate the extents of NDVI, NDBI, and slope on the LST. It concludes that the increase in vegetation and slope would result in slight decrease in temperature whereas the increase in built-up will result in a huge increase in temperature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In December 2019, cases of pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, China, which were caused by the highly contagious coronavirus. This study is aimed at comparing the confusion regarding the selection of effective diagnostic methods to make a mutual comparison among existing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and at determining the most effective one. Based on available published evidence and clinical practice, diagnostic tests of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, namely, fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (fuzzy PROMETHEE) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS). Computerized tomography of chest (chest CT), the detection of viral nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction, cell culture, CoV-19 antigen detection, CoV-19 antibody IgM, CoV-19 antibody IgG, and chest X-ray were evaluated by linguistic fuzzy scale to compare among the diagnostic tests. This scale consists of selected parameters that possessed different weights which were determined by the experts’ opinions of the field. The results of our study with both proposed MCDM methods indicated that the most effective diagnosis method of COVID-19 was chest CT. It is interesting to note that the methods that are consistently used in the diagnosis of viral diseases were ranked in second place for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, each country should use appropriate diagnostic solutions according to its own resources. Our findings also show which diagnostic systems can be used in combination.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic recurrent inflammation of the colon, and clinical outcome of UC is still unsatisfied. Pingkui enema, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, has been safely applied for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery in clinic for many years. However, its mechanism is still elusive. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of Pingkui enema on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and possible mechanism in rats. Methods. UC was induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS in male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were treated with different dosages of Pingkui enema (low, medium, and high) or sulfasalazine for ten days. Survival rate was calculated. A clinical disease activity score was evaluated. Histological colitis severity was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Content of Bifidobacterium in intestinal tissue was analyzed by RT-PCR. Concentration of IL-8, IL-13, TNF-α, D-lactic acid (D-LA), and diamine oxidase (DAO) in serum and contents of adhesin and receptor of Bifidobacterium adhesion in rat intestinal mucus were measured by ELISA. Results. The results showed that Pingkui enema treatment with high dosage markedly improved the survival rate compared with untreated and sulfasalazine treated groups. All dosages of Pingkui enema reduced pathological score. High dosage of Pingkui enema and sulfasalazine treatments significantly reduced the serum concentration of IL-8, TNF-α, D-LA, and DAO and markedly increased the serum concentration of IL-13. In addition, high-dose Pingkui enema and sulfasalazine treatments increased gut content of Bifidobacterium, gut mucus expressions of adhesin, and adhesin receptor of Bifidobacterium. Conclusions. Pingkui enema has therapeutic effect on TNBS-induced UC, and possible mechanism may be via regulation of gut probiotics (Bifidobacterium) and inflammatory factors and protection of intestinal mucosal barrier.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Context. Geographic atrophy (GA) is usually measured manually using fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images, lacking a reliable, automatic method to do so. Aims. To determine the accuracy and repeatability of new software to automatically quantify GA areas associated to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Settings and Design. Tertiary referral hospital in Spain. Cross-sectional and noninterventional. Methods and Material. Forty-six eyes from 33 AMD patients with GA, without previous choroidal neovascularization, were scanned using a SS-OCT (Topcon Corporation, Japan), including three consecutive 7 × 7 mm OCT scans. Three independent masked observers manually measured the GA area using FAF images. These measures were compared to the three automatic determinations of the GA. Lesions were classified according to their morphology and number as regular/irregular and single/multiple. Statistical Analysis Used. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated to study the agreement between the three physicians in manual measurements. ICC through a two-way mixed effects model was used for the software measures, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to analyse the agreement between the physicians and the software. Results. The mean age was 76.3 ± 11.7 years. Eighteen cases showed regular lesions, and 30 showed single lesions. The CCC between manual and automatic measures was 0.95 for the whole sample. The CCC for the area according to the lesion type was 0.92 and 0.97; it was 0.99 for single lesions and 0.89 for multiple lesions. The ICC between the three physicians was 0.94 for the whole sample and 0.88 in multiple lesions. The ICC between the three automatic measures for the area was 0.98 for the whole sample, regular or irregular lesions, and single or multiple lesions. Conclusions. The accuracy of this new software is substantial for the area with a high degree of repeatability agreement, being very precise in single lesions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sign language is an important communication tool between the deaf and the external world. As the number of the Chinese deaf accounts for 15% of the world, it is highly urgent to develop a Chinese sign language recognition (CSLR) system. Recently, a novel phonology- and radical-coded CSL, taking advantages of a limited and constant number of coded gestures, has been preliminarily verified to be feasible for practical CSLR systems. The keynote of this version of CSL is that the same coded gesture performed in different orientations has different meanings. In this paper, we mainly propose a novel two-stage feature representation method to effectively characterize the CSL gestures. First, an orientation-sensitive feature is extracted regarding the distances between the palm center and the key points of the hand contour. Second, the extracted features are transformed by a dynamic time warping- (DTW-) based feature mapping approach for better representation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction and mapping approaches. The averaged classification accuracy of all the 39 types of CSL gestures acquired from 11 subjects exceeds 93% for all the adopted classifiers, achieving significant improvement compared to the scheme without DTW-distance-mapping.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of reviewing scout CT images, obtained for routine oncologic surveillance, for the early identification of pathologic bony lesions. A retrospective review was conducted on patients who previously underwent surgical treatment by two orthopedic oncology surgeons at a tertiary care institution from 2009–2019 for pathologic lesions or fractures of the humerus or femur. Radiographic records were reviewed to identify patients in this cohort who had available scout views from CT imaging prior to official diagnosis of the bony lesion or fracture. CT scout images were assessed by two independent reviewers to identify any pathologic lesions, and radiographic reports were reviewed to identify if the lesions were noted by radiology at the time of the initial scan interpretation. One hundred and forty-four patients were identified, and thirty-nine had an available scout CT image prior to official diagnosis of the lesion. Twenty-five patients (64.1%) had lesions identified by authors on scout CT versus only 9 (23.1%) who had lesions that were documented in the initial CT radiologic report. There was a total of 29 lesions identified by the study authors on scout CT, and 19 (65.5%) were not reported in the initial radiographic interpretation with an average interval between observation by authors and official diagnosis of 202 days. Of the impending fractures, three patients (16.7%) went on to complete fracture prior to referral to orthopedics with an average interval between these missed lesions on scout CT and their presentation with fracture of 68 days. This study advocates for the careful review of all scout CT imaging as an essential part of the work up for metastatic disease and encourages all practitioners to utilize this screening tool for the identification of pathologic bony lesions which may help expedite early treatment to reduce patient morbidity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The purpose of this study was to study the imaging features of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the aphakia with visual axis opacification (VAO) after congenital cataract surgery. Methods. From May 2015 to May 2018, aphakia patients with VAO who underwent congenital cataract surgery were examined by high-resolution bag/balloon UBM technique, and the results of UBM imaging were analyzed. According to UBM imaging features, different types of VAO were classified. Results. A total of 38 children (55 eyes) with VAO were included. 17 patients were bilateral, and 21 patients were unilateral. Patients with VAO were classified into 3 groups according to the UBM imaging features: membranous fibrosis VOA (17 cases, 28 eyes), cortical regeneration VOA (15 cases, 20 eyes), and mixed VOA (6 cases, 7 eyes). The patients in the membranous fibrosis group underwent Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, those in the cortical regeneration group underwent anterior vitrectomy, and those in the mixed type group underwent anterior vitrectomy with RF capsulotomy tip. After surgery, VAO were removed in all patients. During the follow-up period, in the membranous fibrotic VAO group, iris adhesion and pupillary occlusion were found in 2 eyes, and anterior vitrectomy combined with separation of iris adhesion was performed. In cortical regenerative and mixed type VAO groups, anterior vitrectomy was performed without opacity in the axial region. The total recurrence rate of VAO was 3.46%. Conclusion. After congenital cataract surgery, the UBM imaging features of aphakia with VAO are helpful to evaluate the condition of VAO before reoperation so as to choose the optimal surgical method to achieve better therapeutic effect.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Identifying flow patterns from massive trajectories of car tourists is considered a promising way to improve the management of tourism traffic. Previous researches have mainly focused on tourist movements at the macro-scale, such as inbound, domestic, and urban tourism using flow maps. Compared with modeling the flow patterns of tourists at the macro-scale, modeling tourist flow at the microscale is more complicated. This paper takes Dapeng Island located in Shenzhen as the study area and uses the car recognition devices to collect traffic flow. Firstly, car tourists are separated from the mixed traffic flow after analyzing the spatial-temporal characteristics of tourists and residents. Next, daily graphs of tourist movements between road segments and tourist attractions are constructed. Finally, a frequent subgraph mining algorithm is used to extract the flow patterns of car tourists. The experimental results show that (1) car tourists have obvious preferences in the selection of trip time and tourist attractions; (2) the intercity tourists tend to take multidestination trips rather than a single destination trip in the same type of attractions; (3) car tourists are inclined to park their cars in an easy-to-access place, even if the attractions visited are changed. The main contribution of this paper is to present a new method for discovering the flow patterns of car tourists hidden in massive amounts of license plate data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The cervical thymic cyst (CTC) is a rare, benign neck mass that most commonly presents in the pediatric population. These entities can occur anywhere along the normal path of descent of the thymus from the mandible to the sternal notch, and extension into the mediastinum has been observed. The presentation of these masses is often characterized by a painless, enlarging neck mass in a child during the first decade of life. Although most patients are asymptomatic, abutment of the cyst against local structures has led to a variety of presentations including respiratory distress. These rare lesions are noted to have a male predominance and most commonly present on the left side of the neck. We present the rare case of a 19-year-old male who presented with a left-sided painless, cystic neck mass. He underwent a computed tomography scan of the neck which showed a large cystic mass in the left neck deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Preoperatively, the diagnosis of an infected third branchial cyst was favored. The lesion was completely excised in the operating room. Final pathology was consistent with a CTC. The CTC is an uncommon benign process that often presents as an asymptomatic cystic neck mass. Knowledge of the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and treatment of these rare lesions is essential for the Otolaryngologist.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Mohammad Shorif Uddin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Digital image watermarking is an attractive research area since it protects the multimedia data from unauthorized access. For designing an efficient and robust digital image watermarking system, the trade-off among imperceptibility, robustness, capacity, and security must be maintained. Various studies regarding this concern have been performed to ensure these requirements by hybridizing different domains, such as spatial and transform domains. In this paper, we have presented an analytical study of the existing hybrid digital image watermarking methods. At first, we have given a standard framework for designing a hybrid method that ensures the basic design requirements of watermarking for various applications. After a brief literature review, we compared and analyzed the complexity of several existing hybrid methods in a tabular form. The limitations and applications of these methods are also highlighted. Finally, we summarized the challenges of the existing methods and concluded the study by giving future research directions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Aim. Half-elemental diet (ED) (900 kcal/day of ED) has clinical efficacy to treat Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the underlying mechanisms of how the ED exerts its efficacy remain unclear. Alterations of the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, have been reported to play a role in CD pathogenesis. Many variables including diet affect the gut microbiota. We hypothesized that half-ED has the potential to change the gut microbiota composition and functions leading to anti-inflammatory actions. Given that inflammation can be a confounding factor affecting the intestinal microbiota, we aimed to test our hypothesis among healthy individuals in this pilot study. Methods. This prospective study included four healthy volunteers. The subjects continued their dietary habits for 2 weeks after the registration of the study and then started half-ED replacing 900 kcal of the regular diet with ED (time point 1, T1). The subjects continued half-ED for 2 weeks (T2). After the withdrawal of ED, subjects resumed their original dietary habits for 2 weeks (T3). Fecal samples were collected from all subjects at all time points, T1-3. Fecal DNA and metabolites were extracted from the samples. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomic analysis to examine the bacterial compositions and intestinal metabolites. Results. There were differences in the gut bacterial compositions and metabolites at each time point as well as overtime changing patterns between subjects. Several bacteria and metabolites including short-chain fatty acids and bile acids altered significantly across the subjects. The bacterial membership and intestinal metabolites at T3 were different from T1 in all subjects. Conclusions. Half-ED shifts the gut bacterial compositions and metabolites. The changes varied with each individual, while some microbes and metabolites change commonly across individuals. The impact of half-ED may persist even after the withdrawal. This trial is registered with UMIN ID: 000031920.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The cellular automata algorithm is one of the most important developments recently and is becoming an area of great potential in scheduling problems. There has been an increase in the quality and quantity of publications related to this topic. To formally illustrate the research status of the cellular automata algorithm at the global level, bibliometric analysis was used based on the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and 3086 documents were retrieved from different countries and regions. Institutions, journals, authors, research areas, author keywords, and highly cited articles are discussed in detail. The results show that the USA and China are the dominant countries in this field. The USA is the most active country cooperating with other 47 countries or regions, especially with China. The Journal of Cellular Automata is the most productive journal in this field, and the Democritus University of Thrace is the most productive institution also with the highest h-index. “Computer Science” is the most investigated area, with 544 documents involved. In addition, the major topics focused by author keywords are “genetic algorithm,” “swarm intelligence,” and “evolutionary computation.” In addition, the cellular automata algorithm is viewed as a new and effective method to solve the scheduling problems in manufacturing system; meanwhile, historical developments of the application of cellular automata in scheduling are displayed and analyzed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the memory limitation and lack of computing power of consumer level computers, there is a need for suitable methods to achieve 3D surface reconstruction of large-scale point cloud data. A method based on the idea of divide and conquer approaches is proposed. Firstly, the kd-tree index was created for the point cloud data. Then, the Delaunay triangulation algorithm of multicore parallel computing was used to construct the point cloud data in the leaf nodes. Finally, the complete 3D mesh model was realized by constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization based on piecewise linear system and graph cut. The proposed method performed surface reconstruction on the point cloud in the multicore parallel computing architecture, in which memory release and reallocation were implemented to reduce the memory occupation and improve the running efficiency while ensuring the quality of the triangular mesh. The proposed algorithm was compared with two classical surface reconstruction algorithms using multigroup point cloud data, and the applicability experiment of the algorithm was carried out; the results verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed approach.</dc:description>

<dc:description>By considering the feature of vehicle driving on the event management unit of the freeway corridor, according to the system target, a method to divide the management unit of the road network was put forward. The relative safety braking deceleration was taken as the evaluation index of single-vehicle driving risk. The reliability graph relationship and structure-function between the management unit and subunit were analyzed. Then, dynamic safety reliability and real-time safety reliability were determined on the basis of driving risk. In addition, the queuing and dissipating characteristics of the management unit under traffic incidents were analyzed based on the wave theory. The incident duration and dissipation time were also calculated. At the same time, the travel time prediction model of the incident management unit was set up when the real-time safety reliability was taken as a road resistance function. Finally, an improved travel time prediction model established in this paper is of great significance to improve traffic safety and efficiency, and the research results will provide an important theoretical foundation in the freeway corridor route decision.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in canine medicine has been replaced by the evaluation of a few sensitive markers of the acute-phase proteins. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ESR using a point-of-care (MINIPET, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.A.) device (ESR-MP) and to compare the results with the gold standard Westergren method (ESR-W) in dogs. One hundred and nineteen K3-EDTA blood samples for complete blood count were randomly selected and assayed for ESR. The reference interval (RI) was established using the percentile method. The coefficient of variation (CV) in intra-assay and interassay precision of ESR-MP was calculated. The analytical sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated. Agreement between ESR-MP and ESR-W was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient (r), Cohen concordance test (K), Passing-Bablok regression, and Bland–Altman plots. Ten canine samples (8.4%) were ruled out because of flag-error by the MINIPET instrument (4.2%) or because they showed the diphasic pattern in ESR-W (4.2%). The canine RI of ESR-MP was 0–10 mm/h. Precision was excellent in intra-assay (CV = 0.02) and interassay (CV = 0.32). The analytical characteristics of ESR-MP in nonanemic samples were as follows: Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.95, PPV = 0.82, and NPV = 0.95. The accuracy of ESR-MP was better than ESR-W in nonanemic samples (r = 0.87; K = 0.77) and lower in anemic subjects (Hct &lt;37%) (r = 0.76; K = 0.69). The Passing-Bablok regression showed the presence of systematic error and the absence of proportional error only in nonanemic blood samples. The Bland–Altman plots gave negative average values due to the difference in RIs and an agreement in both ESRs. The ESR-MP results can be obtained with the same K3-EDTA tubes used for the blood count, in shortcut time, and at reduced costs using the MINIPET device. These investigations highlight that ESR-MP could be useful in canine clinical settings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Brucellosis is one of the major infectious diseases in China. In this study, we consider an SI model of animal brucellosis with transport. The basic reproduction number ℛ0 is obtained, and the stable state of the equilibria is analyzed. Numerical simulation shows that different initial values have a great influence on results of the model. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of ℛ0 with respect to different parameters is analyzed. The results reveal that the transport has dual effects. Specifically, transport can lead to increase in the number of infected animals; besides, transport can also reduce the number of infected animals in a certain range. The analysis shows that the number of infected animals can be controlled if animals are transported reasonably.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a design for the multivariable control of a cooling system in a PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell stack. This system is complex and challenging enough: interactions between variables, highly nonlinear dynamic behavior, etc. This design is carried out using a multiobjective optimization methodology. There are few previous works that address this problem using multiobjective techniques. Also, this work has, as a novelty, the consideration of, in addition to the optimal controllers, the nearly optimal controllers nondominated in their neighborhood (potentially useful alternatives). In the multiobjective optimization problem approach, the designer must make decisions that include design objectives; parameters of the controllers to be estimated; and the conditions and characteristics of the simulation of the system. However, to simplify the optimization and decision stages, the designer does not include all the desired scenarios in the multiobjective problem definition. Nevertheless, these aspects can be analyzed in the decision stage only for the controllers obtained with a much less computational cost. At this stage, the potentially useful alternatives can play an important role. These controllers have significantly different parameters and therefore allow the designer to make a final decision with additional valuable information. Nearly optimal controllers can obtain an improvement in some aspects not included in the multiobjective optimization problem. For example, in this paper, various aspects are analyzed regarding potentially useful solutions, such as (1) the influence of certain parameters of the simulator; (2) the sample time of the controller; (3) the effect of stack degradation; and (4) the robustness. Therefore, this paper highlights the relevance of this in-depth analysis using the methodology proposed in the design of the multivariable control of the cooling system of a PEM fuel cell. This analysis can modify the final choice of the designer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Social networks provide a convenient place for people to interact; members in social networks may create new connections or break existing connections, driving the evolution of complex network structure. Dynamics in social networks, such as opinion formation and spreading dynamics, may result in complex collective phenomena. This paper conducts a survey on 495 students from six schools in Shaanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces and discusses the impact of self-presentation on adolescent network altruistic behaviors, the intermediary role of social ability cognition, and the moderating role of privacy awareness. The results show the following: (1) Self-presentation in social networks can positively predict adolescent network altruistic behaviors. The positive prediction effect of network sharing is the largest, and the positive prediction effect of network support is the least. (2) Social ability cognition plays an intermediary role between self-presentation and adolescent network altruistic behaviors. (3) The moderating effect of privacy awareness is not significant.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Evolutionary algorithms based on hypervolume have demonstrated good performance for solving many-objective optimization problems. However, hypervolume needs prohibitively expensive computational effort. This paper proposes a simplified hypervolume calculation method which can be used to roughly evaluate the convergence and diversity of solutions. The main idea is to use the nearest neighbors of a particular solution to calculate the volume as the solution’s hypervolume value. Moreover, this paper improves the selection operator and the update strategy of external population according to the simplified hypervolume. Then, the proposed algorithm (SHEA) is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms on fifteen test functions of CEC2018 MaOP competition, and the experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Differential gene analyses on gastric cancer usually focus on expression change of single genes between tumor and adjacent normal tissues. However, besides changes on single genes, there are also coexpression and expression network module changes during the development of gastric cancer. In this study, we proposed a pipeline to investigate various levels of changes between gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues, which were used to repurpose potential drugs for treating gastric cancer. Specifically, we performed a series of analyses on 242 gastric cancer samples (33-normal, 209-cancer) downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), including data quality control, differential gene analysis, gene coexpression network analysis, module function enrichment analysis, differential coexpression analysis, differential pathway analysis, and screening of potential therapeutic drugs. In the end, we discovered some genes and pathways that are significantly different between cancer and adjacent normal tissues (such as the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling pathway) and screened perturbed genes by 2703 drugs that have a high overlap with the identified differentially expressed genes. Our pipeline might be useful for understanding cancer pathogenesis as well as gastric cancer treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a set of stability charts for the stability assessment of rock slopes that satisfy the Hoek–Brown (HB) criterion under various seismic loading conditions. The nonlinear Hoek–Brown strength reduction technique is used to conduct pseudostatic stability analysis of rock slopes subjected to horizontal seismic excitation. Based on an extensive parametric study, first, a set of stability charts with a slope angle of β = 45° under static and pseudostatic conditions are proposed by using ABAQUS 6.10 software. Second, the slope angle weighting factor (fβ) and the seismic weighting factor (fkh) are adopted to characterize the influence of slope angle (β) and horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient (kh) on the rock slope stability. Finally, the reliability of the proposed charts was validated by three typical examples and two case studies, and the results show that the values of the factor of safety (FOS) obtained from the proposed charts are consistent with the values from other methods. The proposed charts provide an efficient and convenient way to determine the FOS of rock slopes directly from the rock mass properties (γ and σci), the HB parameters (mi and GSI), the slope geometry (H and β), and the horizontal seismic coefficients (kh).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gear whine noise has attracted increasing attention from researchers in both the academe and the industry over the past two decades. The wide range of research topics demonstrates that there is a huge technical challenge in understanding the source-path-receiver mechanisms deeply and predicting the gear whine noise precisely. Thoroughly understanding the sources of gear whine noise is the first step to solving this issue. In this paper, the authors summarize a certain number of published articles regarding the sources of gear whine noise. The excitations of gear whine noise are classified into three groups: transmission error along the line of action direction, frictional excitations along the off-line of action direction, and shuttling excitation along the axial direction. The mechanisms, characteristics, predicting approaches, measuring methods, and decreasing strategies for these excitations are summarized. Current research characteristics and future research recommendations are presented at the end.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Precision medicine for breast cancer relies on biomarkers to select therapies. However, the reliability of biomarkers drawn from gene expression arrays has been questioned and calls for reassessment, in particular for large datasets. We revisit widely used data-normalization procedures and evaluate differences in outcome in order to pinpoint the most reliable reprocessing methods biomarkers can be based upon. We generated a database of 3753 breast cancer patients out of 38 studies by downloading and curating patient samples from NCBI-GEO. As gene-expression biomarkers, we select the assessment of receptor status and breast cancer subtype classification. Each normalization procedure is applied separately, and biomarkers are then evaluated for each patient. Differences between normalization pipelines are quantified as percentages of patients having outcomes different for each pipeline. Some normalization procedures lead to quite consistent biomarkers, differing only in 1-2% of patients. Other normalization procedures—some of them have been used in many clinical studies—end up with distrusting discrepancies (10% and more). A good deal of doubt regarding the reliability of microarrays may root in the haphazard application of inadequate preprocessing pipelines. Several modes of batch corrections are evaluated regarding a possible improvement of receptor prediction from gene expression versus the golden standard of immunohistochemistry. Finally, we nominate those normalization methods yielding consistent and trustable results. Adequate bioinformatics data preprocessing is key and crucial for any subsequent statistics to arrive at trustable results. We conclude with a suggestion for future bioinformatics development to further increase the reliability of cancer biomarkers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aphasia is a highly disabling acquired language disorder generally caused by a left-lateralized brain damage. Even if traditional therapies have been shown to induce an adequate clinical improvement, a large percentage of patients are left with some degree of language impairments. Therefore, new approaches to common speech therapies are urgently needed in order to maximize the recovery from aphasia. The recent application of virtual reality (VR) to aphasia rehabilitation has already evidenced its usefulness in promoting a more pragmatically oriented treatment than conventional therapies (CT). In the present study, thirty-six chronic persons with aphasia (PWA) were randomly assigned to two groups. The VR group underwent conversational therapy during VR everyday life setting observation, while the control group was trained in a conventional setting without VR support. All patients were extensively tested through a neuropsychological battery which included not only measures for language skills and communication efficacy but also self-esteem and quality of life questionnairies. All patients were trained through a conversational approach by a speech therapist twice a week for six months (total 48 sessions). After the treatment, no significant differences among groups were found in the different measures. However, the amount of improvement in the different areas was distributed over far more cognitive and psychological aspects in the VR group than in the control group. Indeed, the within-group comparisons showed a significant enhancement in different language tasks (i.e., oral comprehension, repetition, and written language) only in the VR group. Significant gains, after the treatment, were also found, in the VR group, in different psychological dimensions (i.e., self-esteem and emotional and mood state). Given the importance of these aspects for aphasia recovery, we believe that our results add to previous evidence which points to the ecological validity and feasibility of VR treatment for language recovery and psychosocial well-being.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Peanut paste produced in multipurpose mills is very often the site of choice for fungal contaminants that pose a major risk to consumers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of fungal contamination of peanut paste produced according to different moulding processes during storage. Thirty samples of peanut paste were produced from 60 kg of peanut pods according to three types of moulding (domestic moulding, artisanal moulding, and hygienic moulding) and then preserved for three months. These thirty samples were subjected to microbiological analysis using the conventional mould count method. The moisture content of the various peanut pastes was determined according to the AOAC method. Fungi were identified by using taxonomic schemes based on microscopic observation and culture appearance. Mould loads ranged from 0 to 6.4.102 cfu/g; 91 to 9.6.102 cfu/g; and 0 to 4.6.102 cfu/g, respectively, for domestic, artisanal, and hygienic mouldings during conservation. Moisture content increases during the conservation of peanut paste. It increases from 1.23 to 3.17% for domestic moulding, 1.30 to 3.20% for artisanal moulding, and 1.30 to 2.94% for hygienic moulding. Four fungal genera, namely, Aspergillus, Mucor, Absidia, and Penicillium and three species of Aspergillus including A. flavus, A. fumigatus and A. niger have been identified. The peanut paste produced from domestic and hygienic moulding is less contaminated during storage than that obtained in the artisanal way.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The crystal oscillator is a widely used electronic component in a circuit, whose accuracy is strongly affected by the external mechanical environment. To depict the failure mechanism of the crystal oscillator, the damage boundary of this component under the shock environment is studied experimentally in this paper. Through subjecting “step-up” loads on different groups of crystal oscillators, two failure modes (frequency jumping and structural fracture) are monitored and validated. Experimental results prove that “frequency jumping” failure mode is governed by the value of the acceleration shock response spectrum (ASRS) in a certain frequency range, while the failure mode “structural fracture” is governed by the peak value of the ASRS. Through analyzing the shock response spectrum, damage boundaries are given for these two failure modes, which can provide a reference for component design and failure assessment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. This study was aimed at investigating the roles of plasma miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Methods. Plasma samples were isolated from 40 patients with PC and 40 healthy individuals, respectively. The expression of miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 was detected by qRT-PCR. The level of carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) was measured by an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic value of miR-181b, miR-196a, miR-210, CA199, and their combinations in PC. Results. The expression of plasma miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 was significantly upregulated in PC patients. The plasma level of CA199 was also significantly increased in PC patients. The expression of miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 was closely associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and vascular invasion but not correlated with age, gender, and tumor size. miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 have lower AUC than CA199 in the diagnosis of PC. miR-181b+miR-210 and miR-196a+miR-210 also have lower AUC than CA199. It is worth noting that miR-181b+miR-196a+miR-210 has a higher AUC than CA199 in the diagnosis of PC. Conclusion. The combination of plasma miR-181b, miR-196a, and miR-210 had a good diagnostic value for PC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Single-incision percutaneous closure (SIPC) of pediatric inguinal hernia under laparoscopic guidance is a well-developed feasible technique; however, suture knotting remains a major challenge during this technique. Most laparoscopic surgeons prefer extracorporeal subcutaneous suture knotting, which may be associated with consequent formation of stitch sinus and increased recurrence rate. On the other hand, intracorporeal suture knotting necessitates the availability of special devices or homemade instruments with a long learning curve. Therefore, the present study innovates new and simple modification allowing intracorporeal suture knotting during SIPC of pediatric inguinal hernia that does not require any special operating devices or homemade instruments. Patients and Methods. Four-hundred children suffering from inguinal hernia of congenital type, submitted to SIPC using Epidural needle (EN), under laparoscopic guidance with intracorporeal suture knotting. Results. Children ages were 6 months to 10 years (the range). There were 300 boys and 100 girls, and two-hundred children suffered from left side hernia, 150 with right-side hernia, and 50 children with both left- and right-side hernia. 10 ± 2.2 minutes was the recorded operation time in one side hernia repair, while 14 ± 4.3 minutes was recorded for both side repair. Postoperative results reported recurrent hernia in one child and postoperative hydrocele in 3 children which resolved spontaneously after 3 weeks of follow-up. Conclusion. Intracorporeal suture knotting during SIPC of pediatric inguinal hernia allows for the transformation of a formally extraperitoneal procedure to an intraperitoneal procedure. This new modification for intracorporeal suture knotting does not require any special operating devices or homemade instruments. It seems to be an attractive way during SIPC of pediatric inguinal hernia when intracorporeal suture knotting is considered.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. HIV is a chronic life-threatening illness and, like other similar chronic and stigmatizing illnesses, can be stressful to manage. Depression is a common mental health problem that deteriorates the quality of life of people with HIV/AIDS and found to be a strong predictor for noncompliance to antiretroviral therapy treatment. Therefore, epidemiological evidence on the factors associated with depression among patients with HIV/AIDS can contribute towards effective and efficient preventive health care strategies for this population. Objectives. To assess the prevalence and factors associated with depression among HIV/AIDS-infected patients attending ART clinic at Jimma University Medical Center, Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia, in 2018. Methods. This study followed an institution-based cross-sectional quantitative study design. A simple random sampling method yielded 303 participants who were interviewed from April to May 2018, using a pretested questionnaire, followed by their card review. The SPSS version 23 was used for bivariate analysis which was used to find out the significance of association. Variables that showed association in bivariate analysis at p value &lt; 0.25 were entered to multivariable logistic regressions to control for confounders, and the significance of association was determined by 95% confidence interval and p value &lt; 0.05. Results. The point prevalence of depression was 94 (31%). Variables like sex (AOR=0.510 (95%CI=0.264‐0.986)), marital status (AOR=3.610 (95%CI=1.649‐7.901)), opportunistic infection (AOR=3.122 (95%CI=1.700‐5.733)), and medication adherence (AOR=0.470 (95%CI=0.266‐0.831)) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusion and Recommendation. From the findings of this study, it is possible to conclude that depression was highly prevalent among people living with HIV/ADS. Sex, marital status, opportunistic infection, and medication adherence were found to be associated with depression and need attention from the health professional working in the ART clinic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this paper is to study and investigate the optimal control strategy of a discrete mathematical model of drug consumption. The population that we are going to study is divided into six compartments: potential drug users, light drug users, heavy drug users, heavy drug users-dealers and providers, temporary quitters of drug consumption, and permanent quitters of drug consumption. Our objective is to find the best strategy to reduce the number of light drug users, heavy drug users, heavy drug users-dealers and providers, and temporary quitters of drug consumption. We use four control strategies which are awareness programs through media and education, preventing contact through security campaigns, treatment, and psychological support along with follow-up. Pontryagin’s maximum principle in discrete time is used to characterize the optimal controls. The numerical simulation is carried out using MATLAB. Consequently, the obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the optimization strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Secondary metabolites and their biological activity have pharmacological relevance in the prevention and therapeutic management of disease, including the facilitation of normal physiological processes through biochemical mechanisms. In this study, phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activity were evaluated quantitatively on the acetone, ethanol, and aqueous extracts of the flesh, and peel, as well as the boiled peel extract compartments of Musa sinensis L. and Musa paradisiaca L. fruits. Total phenol, proanthocyanidin, and flavonoid contents were estimated and measured spectrophotometrically. The free radical scavenging antioxidant capacity of the extracts was tested on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ethanol), ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay models. Correlation between phytoconstituents and antioxidant activity was analysed using Pearson’s coefficient. The results showed varying amounts of phytochemicals in the solvent extracts of the flesh and peel, including the boiled peel extract of M. sinensis and M. paradisiaca. All acetone extracts of M. sinensis flesh, M. paradisiaca flesh, and M. paradisiaca peel had the highest phytochemical contents, with the exception of the ethanol extract of M. sinensis peel which had the highest phenol content; just as on the overall scale, the peel compartments had generally higher phytochemical profiles than the soft flesh in both fruits. The boiled peel extracts of M. sinensis and M. paradisiaca had the highest ABTS (0.03 mg/mL) and DPPH (0.03 mg/mL) activity. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) was the highest in the ethanol extracts of M. sinensis flesh and peel, and M. paradisiaca flesh, while it was the highest in the acetone extract of M. paradisiaca at the peak concentration used (0.1 mg/mL). There was a significant negative correlation between the total phenol and flavonoid contents of M. sinensis flesh with its DPPH radical scavenging activity and proanthocyanidin content of M. paradisiaca flesh with its DPPH radical scavenging activity. The correlation outcomes indicate that none of the phytochemical constituents solely affected antioxidant activity; instead, a combination of the polyphenolic constituents contributed to antioxidant activity. This study shows the therapeutic potentials of the flesh and, importantly, the peel of M. sinensis and M. paradisiaca fruits on the basis of the polyphenolic constitution against free radicals and oxidative stress.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of morbidity and disability worldwide. However, the pathogenesis of OA is unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize the pathogenesis and implicated genes of OA. The gene expression profiles of GSE82107 and GSE55235 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Altogether, 173 differentially expressed genes including 68 upregulated genes and 105 downregulated genes in patients with OA were selected based on the criteria of ∣log fold‐change∣&gt;1 and an adjusted p value &lt; 0.05. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that FN1, COL1A1, IGF1, SPP1, TIMP1, BGN, COL5A1, MMP13, CLU, and SDC1 are the top ten genes most closely related to OA. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression levels of COL1A1, COL5A1, TIMP1, MMP13, and SDC1 were significantly increased in OA. This study provides clues for the molecular mechanism and specific biomarkers of OA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pseudohypertriglyceridemia is an overestimation of serum triglyceride levels that may incorrectly lead to a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia. Glycerol kinase deficiency is a condition in which glycerol cannot be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, resulting in elevated levels of serum glycerol. Laboratory assays that measure triglycerides indirectly may be affected by elevated glyerol levels and incorrectly report serum tryglyceride levels. We present a case of a novel missense mutation in the GK gene leading to isolated glycerol kinase deficiency and pseudohypertriglyceridemia in a male infant of a mother with gestational diabetes. This paper reviews glycerol kinase deficiency, describes the challenges in diagnosing pseudohypertriglyceridemia, and provides suggestions on improving diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a potential maternal-fetal interaction between gestational diabetes and glycerol kinase deficiency is discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. To investigate the serum changes of oxidative stress markers and the relationship between these factors and visual field (VF) progression in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). Methods. A case-control and a prospective cohort study. A total of 94 patients with PACG and 89 normal controls were enrolled. Furthermore, 94 PACG subjects were followed up for at least two years (once every six months). All participants were evaluated for serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant status (TAS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and detailed eye and systematic examination. Binary logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed. Results. The serum levels of SOD and TAS in the PACG group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Meanwhile, PACG subjects had significantly higher levels of MDA and H2O2 than the normal control subjects (p&lt;0.001). Serum levels of TAS (OR=0.773, 95%CI=0.349−0.714, p&lt;0.001), SOD (OR=0.975, 95%CI=0.955−0.995, p&lt;0.001), MDA (OR=1.155, 95%CI=1.080−1.235, p&lt;0.001), and H2O2 (OR=1.216, 95%CI=1.142−1.295, p&lt;0.001) were independent risk/protective factors for PACG. TAS levels (HR=0.041, 95%CI=0.008–0.218, p&lt;0.001), SOD levels (HR=0.983, 95%CI=0.971–0.994, p=0.003), and MDA levels (HR=1.010, 95%CI=1.001–1.018, p=0.015) at baseline were associated with visual field progression. Kaplan–Meier curves reveal that patients with TAS&lt;0.95/SOD&lt;143/MDA&gt;12 had a significantly higher percentage of PACG progression (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions. Decreased levels of TAS and SOD as well as increased levels of MDA at baseline were associated with VF progression in patients with PACG. These findings suggest that oxidative stress was involved in the onset and development of PACG.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) treatment results in a substantial reduction of low-density lipoprotein- (LDL-) cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) concentrations, which consequently decreases the rate of cardiovascular events. The additional benefit of LA may be associated with its impact on the composition and quality of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, inflammation, and oxidative stress condition. To verify the effects of LA procedure, the current study is aimed at analyzing the effect of a single apheresis procedure with direct hemadsorption (DALI) and cascade filtration (MONET) on oxidative stress markers and HDL-related parameters. The study included eleven patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipoproteinemia(a) treated with regular LA (DALI or MONET). We investigated the pre- and postapheresis concentration of the lipid-related oxidative stress markers 8-isoPGF2, oxLDL, TBARS, and PON-1. We also tracked potential changes in the main HDL apolipoproteins (ApoA-I, ApoA-II) and cholesterol contained in HDL subfractions. A single session of LA with DALI or MONET techniques resulted in a similar reduction of lipid-related oxidative stress markers. Concentrations of 8-isoPGF2 and TBARS were reduced by ~60% and ~30%, respectively. LA resulted in a 67% decrease in oxLDL levels along with a ~19% reduction in the oxLDL/ApoB ratio. Concentrations of HDL cholesterol, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, and PON-1 activity were also reduced by LA sessions, with more noticeable effects seen in the MONET technique. The quantitative proportions between HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol did not change significantly by both methods. In conclusion, LA treatment with MONET or DALI system has a small nonselective effect on lowering HDL particles without any changes in the protein composition of these particles. Significant reduction in the level of oxidative stress parameters and less oxidation of LDL particles may provide an additional benefit of LA therapy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Good quality water is odourless, colourless, and free from faecal pollution, and a satisfactory safe supply must be made available to consumers. The study assessed consumer preference and quality of sachet water sold and consumed in the Sunyani Municipality of Ghana. A cross-sectional study design was used, and data were collected using a structured questionnaire from a sample size of 500 respondents. A total of twenty (20) samples of sachet water commonly sold and consumed in the Sunyani Municipality were also collected and analyzed for bacteriological and physicochemical parameters. Out of these 20 samples, 10 samples of sachet water were collected from the production site and the other 10 samples from the market site. Results showed that respondents’ choice of sachet water was based on several indicators. While 70% (350/500) of consumers indicated that sachet water had taste, 58% (290/500) of them were not enthused when the water had colour. Using smell as an indicator, 71% of consumers have had an experience with sachet water smell being questionable. Water taste (p&lt;0.001), colour of water (p&lt;0.001), smell (p&lt;0.001), and increase in cost (p&lt;0.001) were found as determinants of consumer preference. Consumers who said the colour of water informed their decision when buying sachet water were seven times more likely to have a preference for a particular brand (OR 7.057, CI: 4.474–11.133). Those who checked for expiry dates when buying water (OR 4.871, CI: 3.110–7.628) and those who looked out for Food and Drugs Authority stamp (OR 4.433, CI: 2.806–7.003) were both four times more likely to have a preference for a particular brand. Water quality tests also indicated that 30% of all water samples collected from the production site were contaminated with total coliforms and 50% of sachet water samples collected from the markets were also contaminated with coliforms. The same brands of sachet water that contained total coliforms from the production site were the same brands that contained total coliforms selected from the market. From this study, only total coliforms other than Escherichia coli were detected in the water samples analyzed. It was observed that the evaluated physicochemical parameters of the water analyzed were within the accepted WHO limits. It is recommended that consumers be educated about the indicators to look out for when buying sachet water and, also, that regulatory bodies be empowered to ban the sale of unwholesome brands of sachet water on the market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of pavement recycling technology, the requirement of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is substantially increasing. Warm-mix recycled asphalt (WMRA) technology has made great progress, which can effectively decrease the working temperature and improve the RAP content. In this study, the rheological properties of recycled binders with incorporation of high-percentage artificial RAP binder (30–70%) were evaluated using two types of warm-mix asphalt (WMA) additives, i.e., polyethylene wax R and surfactant M. The dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and beam bending rheometer (BBR) tests were conducted on the recycled binders. The results showed that the temperature and frequency played an important role in determining the complex shear modulus of the high-percentage WMRA binders. The dependency of phase angle on frequency increased after the long-term aging. The WMA additive R had a relatively huge impact on the rheological properties of asphalt, which mainly occurred before the PAV aging of recycled asphalt binder; the WMA additive M had no significant impact on the rheological properties of recycled asphalt binder. The WMA additive R enhanced the low-temperature rheology of recycled asphalt binder, while the WMA additive M enhanced the high-temperature rheology of recycled asphalt binder. Both of these types of WMA additives improved the antifatigue performance of recycled asphalt binder. The increased content of RAP binder improved the high-temperature performance and reduced the low-temperature performance of the recycled asphalt binder. However, it had no obvious impact on the fatigue performance. In addition, there was a good linear relation between the RAP binder content and the two indexes of the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) test.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease of established immune-mediated pathogenesis that affects the oral mucosa. Polycythemia is a nonaggressive myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by an increase in red blood cell mass, often with uncontrolled production of granulocytes and platelets. Their association was rarely mentioned in the scientific literature. The aim of this paper was to report their occurrence in a 52-year-old male patient. Although a casual connection cannot be excluded, both diseases share many similarities in the immune dysfunctions involved in their pathogenesis and their clinical features. Such a hypothesis remains to be demonstrated by further studies. The presence of oral lesions should alert the clinicians in the process of identifying and early diagnosing these diseases. Thus, complications can be prevented and treatment can be started at an early stage, avoiding further damage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Even though wheat commercialization has got great emphasis, smallholder farmers face challenges to participate in the wheat market. As a result, understanding the intensity of smallholder farmers’ wheat commercialization and factors affecting wheat commercialization has vital importance to tackle the problem. Consequently, this study was undertaken in northwestern Ethiopia to measure smallholder farmers’ wheat commercialization and analyze factors that hamper wheat commercialization in the study area. For this purpose, a systematic sampling technique has been employed to select a total of 154 smallholder wheat producer household heads. A semistructured questionnaire has been used as a principal primary data collection method. Similarly, the output commercialization index and the beta regression model have been employed for data analysis. The result of the study showed that 23.4%, 51.9%, and 24.7% of smallholder farmers were subsistence, semicommercialized, and commercialized, respectively. The result indicated that the majority of smallholder farmers are semicommercial wheat producers. Moreover, the beta regression result indicated that educational status, number of oxen, land size allocated to wheat production, farming experience in wheat production, extension service, and market distance are major factors for smallholder farmer’s wheat commercialization. Therefore, an attempt to increase smallholder farmers’ wheat commercialization should give special priority for significant explanatory variables.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Intestinal parasitic infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan countries. The disease burden of these parasites is significantly high among pregnant women in developing countries like Ethiopia. Poor living conditions, sanitation, and hygiene are believed to be the contributing factors. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of intestinal parasitic infection and factors associated with pregnant women. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2017 to June 2017. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain the sociodemographic and other explanatory variables via face-to-face interviews. Stool samples were collected and examined using formol ether concentration technique. The magnitude of parasitic infection was calculated using descriptive statistics. The association between intestinal parasitic infection and determinant factors was assessed by logistic regression. The differences were considered to be statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Results. From a total of 743 pregnant women, the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 277 (37.3%). The prevalence of hookworm 138 (18.6%) was the leading cause of intestinal parasitosis followed by E. histolytica/dispar 113 (15.2%). Dwelling in rural area (AOR: 2.9 (95% CI: 1.85-4.85)), being a farmer (AOR: 1.91 (95% CI: 1.20-3.03)), eating raw vegetables (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI:0.09-0.24), lack of proper use of latrine (AOR: 2.89 (95%1.18-7.08)), poor environmental sanitation (AOR: 0.19 (95%: CI:0.08-0.47)), habit of soil eating (AOR: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.25-0.72)), having irrigation practice (AOR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.29-0.77)), and lack of health education (AOR: 0.32 (95% CI: 0.13-0.77)) were significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infections. Conclusions. Intestinal parasitic infection is a major problem among pregnant women in the study area. High parasitic infection is associated with poor hygienic and sanitation practices. Therefore, awareness creation through health education should be given to pregnancy on intestinal parasitic infection and associated factors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The antibacterial activity of the extracts of Aframomum melegueta including n-hexane extract (NHE), nondefatted methanol extract (NDME), and defatted methanol extract (DME) was investigated in this study. The NHE exhibited no antibacterial activity. The DME showed higher antibacterial activity than the NDME against the different isolates. At the highest concentration of 10 mg/mL in agar diffusion, NDME produced inhibition zones ranging from 11 to 29 mm against the microorganisms while DME produced inhibition zones ranging from 20 to 40 mm with the concentration of 10 mg/mL against the microorganisms. 0.1 mg/mL of the DME produced inhibition zones ranging between 12 and 14 mm in Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 35654 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, respectively, while none of the isolates were inhibited by the NDME at a concentration of 1 mg/mL or less. In the agar dilution assay, the MICs of the NDME and DME ranged between 0.31 and 10 mg/mL, but more isolates were inhibited at 0.31 mg/mL of DME than those in NDME. In macrobroth assay, the MICs of the NDME ranged between 0.15 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs ranged between 0.63 and 5.0 mg/mL, and the MICs of the DME ranged between 0.08 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs were between 0.31 and 5.0 mg/mL. This study indicated that DME was more active with higher antibacterial activity than the NDME of this plant, and extracting the fatty portion of plant materials prior susceptibility testing would allow plant extracts to be more effective as well as justifying the use of Aframomum melegueta in traditional medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Aims. The value of hepatocyte regeneration in predicting the outcomes of hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) is not fully assessed. The present study was aimed at establishing a novel scoring system to predict patients’ outcomes within 3 months by applying serological indicators of hepatic regeneration and liver injury. Methods. Patients with chronic hepatitis B who had a rapid deterioration were investigated. Patients were observed for 90 days, and the endpoint of follow-up was death or liver transplantation. Serum parameters were estimated on the diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors and create a novel prognostic scoring system, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the performance of the model. Results. A total of 308 patients with HBV-ACLF were incorporated and divided into the training cohort (n=206) and testing cohort (n=102) randomly. Creatine (Cre), age, total bilirubin (TBil), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and international normalized ratio (INR) were found to be independent prognostic factors. According to the results of Cox regression analysis, a new prognostic model (we named it the TACIA score) was calculated. The areas under ROC (AUROC) for the new model were 0.861 and 0.763 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively, and patients with lower TACIA scores (&lt;4.34) would survive longer (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions. A pertinent prognostic scoring system for patients with HBV-ACLF was established in our study, and the novel model could predict patients’ short-term survival effectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A sensitive and reliable ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of parecoxib and its metabolite valdecoxib in beagles. The effects of dexmedetomidine on the pharmacokinetics of parecoxib and valdecoxib in beagles were studied. The plasma was precipitated by acetonitrile, and the two analytes were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 1.7 μm); the mobile phase was acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid with gradient mode, and the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. In the negative ion mode, the two analytes and internal standard (IS) were monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), and the mass transition pairs were as follows: m/z 369.1→119.1 for parecoxib, m/z 313.0→118.0 for valdecoxib, and m/z 380.0→316.0 for celecoxib (IS). Six beagles were designed as a double cycle self-control experiment. In the first cycle, after intramuscular injection of parecoxib 1.33 mg/kg, 1.0 mL blood samples were collected at different times (group A). In the second cycle, the same six beagles were intravenously injected with 2 μg/kg dexmedetomidine for 7 days after one week of washing period. On day 7, after intravenous injection of 2 μg/kg dexmedetomidine for 0.5 hours, 6 beagle dogs were intramuscularly injected with 1.33 mg/kg parecoxib, and blood samples were collected at different time points (group A). The concentration of parecoxib and valdecoxib was detected by UPLC-MS/MS, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0 software. Under the experimental conditions, the method has a good linear relationship for both analytes. The interday and intraday precision was less than 8.07%; the accuracy values were from -1.20% to 2.76%. Cmax of parecoxib in group A and group B was 2148.59±406.13 ng/mL and 2100.49±356.94 ng/mL, t1/2 was 0.85±0.36 h and 0.85±0.36 h, and AUC0‐t was 2429.96±323.22 ng·h/mL and 2506.38±544.83 ng·h/mL, respectively. Cmax of valdecoxib in group A and group B was 2059.15±281.86 ng/mL and 2837.39±276.78 ng/mL, t1/2 was 2.44±1.55 h and 2.91±1.27 h, and AUC0‐t was 4971.61±696.56 ng·h/mL and 6770.65±453.25 ng·h/mL, respectively. There was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of parecoxib in groups A and B. Cmax and AUC0−∞ of valdecoxib in group A were 37.79% and 36.19% higher than those in group B, respectively, and t1/2 was increased from 2.44 h to 2.91 h. Vz/F and CLz/F were correspondingly reduced, respectively. The developed UPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of parecoxib and valdecoxib in beagle plasma was specific, accurate, rapid, and suitable for the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of parecoxib and valdecoxib. Dexmedetomidine can inhibit the metabolism of valdecoxib in beagles and increase the exposure of valdecoxib, but it does not affect the pharmacokinetics of parecoxib.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Shield recovery in water-rich sand strata is a challenging issue in the field of shield tunnel engineering, especially when the end of the shaft cannot be reinforced by jet grouting or freezing or when the shield cannot be supported with a steel sleeve. Therefore, it is important to develop an effective recovery approach and adopt suitable techniques to control the risks. In this study, a new method based on filling the receiving shaft with water is proposed for the underwater recovery of an earth pressure balance (EPB) shield with zero end reinforcement from a metro tunnel in Tel Aviv, Israel. Several additional techniques are used to ensure safe recovery of the shield, including the design of a concrete cradle, drilling of pressure relief holes, control of excavation parameters, screw conveyor sealing, portal sealing, tail sealing, and grouting. Furthermore, according to the actual situation on site, filling the shaft with water to 1 m above the water level in the strata can prevent the fine sand from percolating into the shaft. Before the cutterhead approaches the underground diaphragm wall, the driving attitude should be strictly controlled, and the edge hob should be inspected for wear. The necessary thrust of shield tunneling in the underground diaphragm wall and shaft is calculated theoretically. In order to ensure the deformation control of the underground diaphragm wall and the smooth tunneling of the shield, the thrust of the shield excavating the underground diaphragm wall will not be larger than 12 000 kN, and the penetration degree will be limited to 3 mm/r. Qualitative observations and measurements of surface subsidence in the metro tunnel indicate that these risk mitigation techniques are effective and suitable for the underwater recovery of EPB shields in water-rich sand strata.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cardiocerebral vascular disease (CCVD) is a common disease with high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Oxidative stress (OS) is closely related to the progression of CCVD. Abnormal redox regulation leads to OS and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause biomolecular and cellular damage. The Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway is one of the most important defense systems against exogenous and endogenous OS injury, and Nrf2 is regarded as a vital pharmacological target. The complexity of the CCVD pathological process and the current difficulties in conducting clinical trials have hindered the development of therapeutic drugs. Furthermore, little is known about the role of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in CCVD. Clarifying the role of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in CCVD can provide new ideas for drug design. This review details the recent advancements in the regulation of the Nrf2/ARE system and its role and activators in common CCVD development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The production of long-chain carbon compounds (C9-C21) from biomass derivatives to alternate traditional fossil diesel is sustainable, eco-friendly, and potentially economic for modern industry. In this work, phosphotungstic acid heterogenized by 3-bromopyridine was achieved using a solvothermal method, which was demonstrated to be efficient for trimerization of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with 2-methylfuran (2-MF) to C21 fuel precursor (57.1% yield) under mild reaction conditions. The heterogeneous acidic catalyst could be reused for four consecutive cycles without obvious loss of activity, and different characterization techniques (e.g., XRD (X-ray diffraction), TG (thermogravimetric analysis), SEM (scanning electron microscope), FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and BET (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller)) were utilized to investigate the performance of the catalyst. In addition, a plausible reaction pathway was postulated, on the basis of results obtained by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometer). This strategy provides a facile and efficient approach to prepare a recyclable acidic catalyst for the production of diesel fuel precursor from biomass via controllable polymerization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was aimed at evaluating the in vitro effect of the edible mushroom (EM) Pleurotus eryngii against the eggs and larvae (L3) of Haemonchus contortus. The evaluation included acetone (AE) and hydroalcoholic (HA) extracts of the following strains: ECS-1138, ECS-1156, ECS-1255, ECS-1258, ECS-1261, ECS-1282, and ECS-1292. The HA extract of the ECS-1255 strain showed the highest effect on mortality rates of L3 (18.83%) at 20 μg/mL. After subjecting this HA extract to a normal phase chromatography column, five fractions were obtained; fraction F5 (100% MeOH) was the most effective against eggs, with hatching inhibition percentages of 88.77 and 91.87% at 20 and 40 mg/mL, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) subjected this fraction to an acetylation reaction to determine the content of the secondary metabolites. The GC-MS analysis showed that the F5 fraction was composed of trehalose CAS: 6138-23-4, polyols (L-iditol CAS: 488-45-9, galactitol CAS: 608-66-2, D-mannitol CAS: 69-65-8, D-glucitol CAS: 50-70-4, and myoinositol CAS: 87-89-8), adipic acid CAS: 124-04-9, stearic acid CAS: 57-11-4, squalene CAS: 111-02-4, and β-sitosterol CAS: 83-46-5.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Nga Thi-Hong Pham</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Van-Thuc Nguyen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, the laser cladding is created by using Co50 powder and TiC mixture, covering a H13 hot-working steel substrate. The samples are analyzed by the hardness test, XRD, SEM, and friction test to identify the forming phases, microhardness distribution, and wear-resistant characteristics. The results indicated that hardness reduces from the coating zone to the substrate, achieving the highest value at the coating zone. Increasing the content of TiC results in improving the coating hardness. The coatings with 10%–20% TiC show high-quality surface morphology and macrograph. With 30% TiC, the hardness obtains a higher hardness, but the surface appears to crack. The microstructures of the coatings present a well-mixed and well-distribution of the TiC particle on the Co matrix. The friction coefficient of H13 steel and Co50 coating reaches the maximum value when the load is 50 N and mostly decreases with the increase in the load. The wear rates of H13 steel and Co50 coatings mainly increase with the increase in the load. The temperature has a greater influence on the friction coefficient of the Co50 coating. However, the temperature has a small effect on the friction coefficient of the 20% TiC coating. The wear resistance of 20% TiC coating is higher than that of H13 steel, Co50 coating, and 10% TiC composite coating. At room temperature, the wear mechanism of the coating is mainly brittle spalling, adhesive wear, and ploughing. At 700°C, the wear mechanism is mostly oxidation wear and fatigue wear. After laser cladding, the service life of the coated surface could be greatly improved. The Co + 20% TiC coating has high hardness and wear resistance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Endothelial dysfunction tends to be the initial indicator in proinflammatory state and macro- and microvascular complications, such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. It has been shown that certain compounds in diet can generate beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease due to its interactions with endothelial cells. Thus, this review is aimed at investigating whether certain polyphenols present in the Mediterranean diet, specifically catechin, quercetin, resveratrol, and urolithin, could exert positive effects on endothelial dysfunction. After analysis of numerous papers, we found that polyphenols aiding endothelial function is beneficial not only for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or endothelial dysfunction but for all people as it can improve the effects of aging on the endothelia. The additional benefit of these polyphenols on weight loss further improves health and lowers the risk of several diseases, including those caused by endothelial dysfunction. However, it is important to note that the dosages in the majorities of the studies mentioned in this review were of supplemental rather than nutritionally relevant quantities, and therefore, the recommended dosages are difficult to determine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis, and autophagy inhibits inflammasome activation by targeting macrophages. We investigated whether fucoidan, a marine sulfated polysaccharide derived from brown seaweeds, could reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation by enhancing sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1)-dependent selective autophagy to alleviate atherosclerosis in high-fat-fed ApoE-/- mice with partial carotid ligation and differentiated THP-1 cells incubated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Fucoidan significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation, attenuated progression of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, deregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy receptor p62, and upregulated microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II/I levels. Transmission electron microscopy and GFP-RFP-LC3 lentivirus transfection further demonstrated that fucoidan could activate autophagy. Mechanistically, fucoidan remarkably inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which was mostly dependent on autophagy. The inhibitory effects of fucoidan on NLRP3 inflammasome were enhanced by autophagy activator rapamycin (Rapa) and alleviated by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Fucoidan promoted the colocalization of NLRP3 and p62. Knockdown of p62 and ATG5 by small interfering RNA significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of fucoidan treatment on NLRP3 inflammasome. The data suggest that fucoidan can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by enhancing p62/SQSTM1-dependent selective autophagy to alleviate atherosclerosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, the frequent outbreak of information security incidents caused by information security vulnerabilities has brought huge losses to countries and enterprises. Therefore, the research related to information security vulnerability has attracted many scholars, especially the research on the identification of information security vulnerabilities. Although some organizations have established information description databases for information security vulnerabilities, the differences in their descriptions and understandings of vulnerabilities have increased the difficulty of information security precautions. This paper studies the construction of a security vulnerability identification system, summarizes the system requirements, and establishes a vulnerability text classifier based on machine learning. It introduces the word segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and verification processing of vulnerability description text. The contribution of this paper is mainly in two aspects: One is to standardize the unified description of vulnerability information, which lays a solid foundation for vulnerability analysis. The other is to explore the research methods of a vulnerability identification system for information security and establish a vulnerability text classifier based on machine learning, which can provide reference for the research of similar systems in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. We retrospectively examined the relationship between daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), mainly in the elderly. Methods. We included 97 patients with nonvariceal UGIB diagnosed at our hospital from January 2012 to October 2017. Bleeding severity was assessed using the shock index (SI) and estimated bleeding volume; 49 patients met the criterion for the mild group and 48 for the moderate/severe group. The effect of PPI use on bleeding severity was compared between the groups. The relationships of PPI use and dose with the clinical symptoms of UGIB were also analyzed. Results. Among the 97 patients, 17 (17.5%) habitually used PPIs. The rate of habitual PPI use was significantly higher in the mild group, indicating as an independent factor contributing to a reduction in the severity of UGIB in a multiple logistic regression analysis (30.6% vs. 4.2%; OR 10.147; 95% CI 2.174–47.358, P&lt;0.01). When analyzing data for a subgroup of patients older than 75 years, we found the protective PPI effect to be even higher in the mild UGIB group than in the moderate/severe group (37.0% vs. 5.6%; OR 10.000; 95% CI 1.150–86.951, P&lt;0.05). Conversely, we found no association between PPI prescription and UGIB symptoms in patients younger than 75 years. The mean estimated bleeding volume and SI in the 17 habitual PPI users were both significantly less than those among the 80 nonhabitual users, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The proportion of patients with mild UGIB was similar between the low- and high-dose PPI users. Conclusions. Particularly in elderly patients with nonvariceal UGIB, habitual PPI use can alleviate the clinical symptoms of UGIB by suppressing the volume of bleeding, regardless of the adapted dose of PPIs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background/Aims. Preoperative oral rehydration therapy (PORT), often used before surgery, is rarely performed before endoscopy. Only a few reports of PORT before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are available. This study is aimed at evaluating the safety and feasibility of PORT before upper gastrointestinal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Methods. We used alginade water (125 mL, Nestle Co., Kobe, Japan) for PORT. Alginade water is a flavored sports drink, which is palatable and promotes wound healing due to a high concentration of alginate. We conducted a single-center single-arm prospective feasibility study of PORT in 244 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal ESD. The group wherein PORT was administered up to two hours before ESD (n=120) was compared with the historical control group (non-PORT group, n=120). We investigated the total fluid intake, hematocrit change, complications due to PORT, complications during ESD, ESD procedure time, and length of hospital stay in each group. Results. The average fluid intake in the PORT group was 462.6 mL. No complications were observed due to PORT and ESD, and significant differences in the ESD procedure time or hospital stay was not noted. Conclusion. PORT up to two hours before upper gastrointestinal ESD is feasible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An aerospace vehicle in high-speed flight involves distributed multiple fields of view (FoVs) of a star sensor, and the maneuvering of the vehicle requires inertial-aided star pattern matching. Accordingly, an inertial-aided star pattern matching method for distributed multiple FoVs is proposed. First, the observation and fusion principles of distributed multiple FoVs are illustrated. Then, an inertial-aided star pattern matching scheme is designed based on the space-time distribution of the line-of sight (LoS) vector and inertial measurement information. Next, an LoS vector estimation method assisted by inertial information and the dynamic establishment of a distributed local catalog are proposed. Finally, in a simulation, the dynamic establishment of the part catalog improves the efficiency of star pattern matching by reducing the catalog scale, and the usability of inertial-aided star pattern matching is analyzed for different gyro and accelerometer precisions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Alginate is one of the natural polymers that are often used in drug- and protein-delivery systems. The use of alginate can provide several advantages including ease of preparation, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nontoxicity. It can be applied to various routes of drug administration including targeted or localized drug-delivery systems. The development of alginates as a selected polymer in various delivery systems can be adjusted depending on the challenges that must be overcome by drug or proteins or the system itself. The increased effectiveness and safety of sodium alginate in the drug- or protein-delivery system are evidenced by changing the physicochemical characteristics of the drug or proteins. In this review, various routes of alginate-based drug or protein delivery, the effectivity of alginate in the stem cells, and cell encapsulation have been discussed. The recent advances in the in vivo alginate-based drug-delivery systems as well as their toxicities have also been reviewed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Internet of Things is the core technology of smart agriculture and can reform and upgrade traditional agriculture for reducing cost, reducing pollution, and increasing productivity and quality in China. From government-led and market economy perspectives, promotion mechanisms and sustainable adoption of agricultural Internet of Things technology are analyzed. In the initial application phase, the promotion of Internet of Things requires government support. For investigating the relationship between the government and farmers, this study builds an evolutionary game model and finds that increases of cost subsidy, farmers’ negative feedback, government’s positive feedback, and chemical agriculture cost can make the model evolve toward the strategy set: farmer adoption and government support. For long-term development, a sustainable model in competitive market is built by competition game and exponential replication equation. This paper analyzes the equilibrium of adoption ratio, long-run profit, and the conversion between equilibrium points under capacity sharing strategy in competitive market. It is also found that the market will eventually evolve to the technology selection strategy whose long-run average profit dominates the market. The innovations are that evolutionary game is used for analyzing the initial stage and competitive game and asynchronous update mechanism are used for analyzing the sustainable development adoption. At last, references are provided for agricultural Internet of Things development policy from the perspectives of initial promotion and long-run sustainability.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yueli Chen</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Juhong Ge</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper presents a study on the performance of a positive position feedback (PPF) controller to suppress the vibration of a horizontal beam under vertical excitation. Time delays in the control loop are taken into consideration to study their effects on the controller performance and the stable region. The integral iterative method is conducted to obtain a second-order approximate solution and the corresponding amplitude equations for the considered system. The stability of the steady-state solutions is ascertained using a combination of Floquet theory and Hill’s determinant. The maximum limits of time delays at which the system remains stable have been determined for different values of control parameters. And the effects of various control parameters on the existence of multiple-solution region are investigated. The analysis illustrates that the appearance of time delay and the elimination of controller damping coefficient are the two main factors to enhance the nonlinear characteristics of the controlled system. The points at which the steady-state amplitude of the main system reaches its minimum are studied analytically. The analyses show that the analytical results are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to study the influence of the vetiver root system on the swelling characteristics and crack resistance of expansive soil, vetiver grass root growth and its vertical distribution were investigated by the cultivation test and observation. The expansion rate experiment without load and expansive force tests was conducted on planted grass root soil samples, and the effect of the root content on the expansion rate and force of soil mass was analyzed. Finally, the effects of different vetiver contents on the crack resistance of expansive soil were studied by soil cracking experiments in an outdoor natural environment. The results showed that on account of the reinforcement effect of crisscrossing and winding grassroots, the expansion rate and expansive force can be reduced by the grass roots, and the grass roots can significantly increase the anticracking properties of the root-soil composites. From the surface down, the inhibition effect of the vetiver root on the expansive soil appeared from low to high and then decreased; the effect was optimal in the layer of 10∼15 cm. Compared with the pure expansive soil, the swelling force of the cultivated root expansive soil growing for 180 d decreased by more than 80%, and the unloaded expansive soil reduced by more than 70%. Compared with pure expansive soil, the swelling force and the unloaded expansion rate of cultivated root expansive soil growing for 90 d decreased by more than 50%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Leslie population model for two generations is investigated by qualitative analysis and numerical simulation. For the different parameters a and b in the model, the dynamics of the system are studied, respectively. It shows many complex dynamic behavior, including several types of bifurcations leading to chaos, such as period-doubling bifurcations and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. With the change of parameters, attractor crises and chaotic bands with periodic windows appear. The largest Lyapunov exponents are numerically computed and can verify the rationality of the theoretical analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Bin Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xiaolei Hao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cognitive radar can overcome the shortcomings of traditional radars that are difficult to adapt to complex environments and adaptively adjust the transmitted waveform through closed-loop feedback. The optimization design of the transmitted waveform is a very important issue in the research of cognitive radar. Most of the previous studies on waveform design assume that the prior information of the target spectrum is completely known, but actually the target in the real scene is uncertain. In order to simulate this situation, this paper uses a robust waveform design scheme based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and mutual information (MI). After setting up the signal model, the SINR and MI between target and echo are derived based on the information theory, and robust models for MI and SINR are established. Next, the MI and SINR are maximized by using the maximum marginal allocation (MMA) algorithm and the water-filling method which is improved by bisection algorithm. Simulation results show that, under the most unfavorable conditions, the robust transmitted waveform has better performance than other waveforms in the improvement degree of SINR and MI. By comparing the robust transmitted waveform based on SINR criterion and MI criterion, the influence on the variation trend of SINR and MI is explored, and the range of critical value of Ty is found. The longer the echo observation time is, the better the performance of the SINR-based transmitted waveform over the MI-based transmitted waveform is. For the mutual information between the target and the echo, the performance of the MMA algorithm is better than the improved water-filling algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There are various methods available which are used to search large chemical databases and to predict the physicochemical properties of molecular structures. Using molecular descriptors for this purpose is the simplest of these methods. The Zagreb indices are amongst the oldest molecular descriptors, and their properties have been extensively studied and applied in QSAR/QSPR studies. The Zagreb coindices were recently introduced, attracting the attention of researchers in mathematical chemistry. In this paper, we study Zagreb indices and several other Zagreb-type indices including the general Randić index, sum-connectivity index, F-index, and Zagreb coindices of R-vertex and edge join of two arbitrary graphs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A unified design model is proposed for various kinds of passive dynamic absorbers (PDAs) attached to buildings with different lateral resisting systems. A total of five different PDAs are considered in this study: (1) tuned mass damper (TMD), (2) circular tuned sloshing damper (C-TSD), (3) rectangular tuned sloshing damper (R-TSD), (4) two-way liquid damper (TWLD), and (5) pendulum tuned mass damper (PTMD). The unified model consists of a coupled shear-flexural (CSF) discrete model with equivalent tuned mass dampers (TMDs), which allows the consideration of intermediate modes of lateral deformation. By modifying the nondimensional lateral stiffness ratio, the CSF model can consider lateral deformations varying from those of a flexural cantilever beam to those of a shear cantilever beam. The unified model was applied to a 144-meter-tall building located in the Valley of Mexico, which was subjected to both seismic and along-wind loads. The building has similar fundamental periods of vibration and different nondimensional lateral stiffness ratios for both translational directions, which shows the importance of considering both bending and shear stiffness in the design of PDAs. The results show a great effectiveness of PDAs in controlling along-wind RMS accelerations of the building; on the contrary, PDAs were ineffective in controlling peak lateral displacements. For a single PDA attached at the rooftop level, the maximum possible value of the PDA mass efficiency index increases as the nondimensional lateral stiffness ratio decreases; therefore, there is an increase in the vibration control effectiveness of PDAs for lateral flexural-type deformations.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hongbo Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shimin Dong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The mechanical model of transverse vibration of sucker rod string (SRS) in directional well is simplified to the transverse vibration model of longitudinal and transverse curved beam with initial bending under borehole constraints. In this paper, besides considering the excitation of alternating axial load on the transverse vibration of SRS, it is proposed for the first time that curved borehole is also the main excitation for the transverse vibration when the SRS moves reciprocating axially in the borehole. Based on the elastic body vibration theory, the transverse vibration mathematical model of SRS with initial bending under borehole constraints is established. In this model, the curved borehole excitation caused by the axial motion and the alternating axial load excitation is considered. Besides, the elastic collision theory is applied to describe the constraint of tube on the SRS transverse vibration in this model. Then the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is used to calculate the transverse vibration of SRS in directional wells. The simulation results show the following: (1) The simulation results of the three simulation models in this paper are different. The results indicate that the curved borehole excitation caused by the axial motion and the alternating axial load excitation is the main excitation for the SRS transverse vibration. (2) In directional wells, the rod and tube contact along the well depth, and the dangerous sections locate at the deviation section of the borehole and the compression section of the rod. On the whole, the contact force between rod and tube in deviation section of borehole is larger. The transverse vibration of the compression section of the rod is the most violent.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>A. Q. Khan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, the local dynamics and Neimark–Sacker bifurcation of a two-dimensional glycolytic oscillator model in the interior of ℝ+2 are explored. It is investigated that for all α and β, the model has a unique equilibrium point: Pxy+α/β+α2,α. Further about Pxy+α/β+α2,α, local dynamics and the existence of bifurcation are explored. It is investigated about Pxy+α/β+α2,α that the glycolytic oscillator model undergoes no bifurcation except the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. Some simulations are given to verify the obtained results. Finally, bifurcation diagrams and the corresponding maximum Lyapunov exponent are presented for the glycolytic oscillator model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The performance of graph-based clustering methods highly depends on the quality of the data affinity graph as a good affinity graph can approximate well the pairwise similarity between data samples. To a large extent, existing graph-based clustering methods construct the affinity graph based on a fixed distance metric, which is often not an accurate representation of the underlying data structure. Also, they require postprocessing on the affinity graph to obtain clustering results. Thus, the results are sensitive to the particular graph construction methods. To address these two drawbacks, we propose a k-component graph clustering (k-GC) approach to learn an intrinsic affinity graph and to obtain clustering results simultaneously. Specifically, k-GC learns the data affinity graph by assigning the adaptive and optimal neighbors for each data point based on the local distances. Efficient iterative updating algorithms are derived for k-GC, along with proofs of convergence. Experiments on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of k-GC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Querying average distances is useful for real-world applications such as business decision and medical diagnosis, as it can help a decision maker to better understand the users’ data in a database. However, privacy has been an increasing concern. People are now suffering serious privacy leakage from various kinds of sources, especially service providers who provide insufficient protection on user’s private data. In this paper, we discover a new type of attack in an average-distance query (AVGD query) with noisy results. The attack is general that it can be used to reveal private data of different dimensions. We theoretically analyze how different factors affect the accuracy of the attack and propose the privacy-preserving mechanism based on the analysis. We experiment on two real-life datasets to show the feasibility and severity of the attack. The results show that the severity of the attack is mainly influenced by the factors including the noise magnitude, the number of queries, and the number of users in each query. Also, we validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis by comparing with the experimental results and confirm the effectiveness of the privacy-preserving mechanism.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Florian Beissner</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Physical sensations of tingling, warmth, dull pain, and heaviness are a common phenomenon in mind-body interventions, such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy, osteopathy, qigong, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation. Even though there are striking parallels between sensations produced by many different interventions, no attempt has yet been made to understand them from a unifying perspective that combines information from different therapies and practices. Therefore, this narrative systematic review introduces the concept of therapeutic sensations and summarizes studies of their sensory quality, bodily topography, and the meaning that patients attach to them. Furthermore, it highlights the essential role of therapeutic sensations in the development of vital energy concepts, such as qi, prana, pneuma, and orgone, in various traditional medicine systems, body-oriented psychotherapy, and so-called energy medicine. Finally, the assessment of therapeutic sensations may help to gain a deeper understanding of such concepts, finding a common language between scientists, patients and practitioners, and bridging the wide gap between materialistic and vitalistic views.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) injections for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) in eyes with and without previous vitrectomy. The medical records of 28 eyes (11 vitrectomized and 17 nonvitrectomized) of 28 patients (mean age, 59.0 ± 9.6 years; male to female ratio 1 : 1) who were diagnosed with DME and had received IVR treatment were reviewed retrospectively. The indications of vitrectomy in 11 vitrectomized eyes were intravitreal hemorrhage (n = 8) and epiretinal membrane (n = 3). The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and total macular volume (TMV) were measured at baseline and at months 6, 12, 18, and 24 of the follow-up. The number of IVR injections, the duration between diagnosis of DME and IVR injection, and the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at baseline were also recorded. Baseline demographics, HbA1c, BCVA, CMT, and TMV values were similar between two groups (p&gt;0.05). The duration between diagnosis of DME and IVR injections was similar in both groups (16 ± 5 months vs. 13 ± 4 months, respectively; p=0.11). IVR injection was performed 6.3 times in vitrectomized eyes and 6.1 times in nonvitrectomized eyes during the 24-month period (p&gt;0.05). The mean BCVA improved significantly during the 24-month period in both groups. The improvements in BCVA, in CMT, and in TMV were more significant at month 6 (p=0.036) group, at month 12 (p=0.013), at month 12 (p=0.021), and month 24 (p=0.021) in nonvitrectomized eyes, respectively, while there was no difference in improvements of BCVA, CMT, and TMV in vitrectomized group at each visit. Treatment effected by time in terms of BCVA, CMT, and TMV values in all groups (p=0.0004, p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), not by time-group interaction and group (all p values &gt;0.05). In conclusion, IVR treatment for DME is equally effective in both groups. However, the response to treatment is seen earlier in nonvitrectomized eyes compared to vitrectomized eyes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Schistosomiasis remains a major neglected tropical disease. The treatment and control of schistosomiasis rely on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Despite its efficacy, treatment with PZQ presents some major drawbacks including an inability of the chemotherapy to reverse disease-induced fibrosis and the prospect of the emergence of drug resistance. Here, we investigated a novel therapeutic approach with antioxidant biomolecules in combination with PZQ against the adult developmental stage of Schistosoma mansoni and oviposition in vitro, given that this therapeutic approach achieved synergistic/additive activity against larval schistosomes. The antioxidants curcumin and oxadiazole per se exhibited antischistosomal activity against adult worms leading to severe morphological alterations and death. Additionally, the antioxidant flavone combined with vandetanib or imatinib improved antischistosomal activity against adult forms. By contrast, however, these antioxidant-anthelmintic combinations were not as effective against adults in comparison to larval schistosomes. Nevertheless, the antioxidants alone or combined with drugs inhibited oviposition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Single-cell RNA sequencing allows highly detailed profiling of cellular immune responses from limited-volume samples, advancing prospects of a new era of systems immunology. The power of single-cell RNA sequencing offers various opportunities to decipher the immune response to infectious diseases and vaccines. Here, we describe the potential uses of single-cell RNA sequencing methods in prophylactic vaccine development, concentrating on infectious diseases including COVID-19. Using examples from several diseases, we review how single-cell RNA sequencing has been used to evaluate the immunological response to different vaccine platforms and regimens. By highlighting published and unpublished single-cell RNA sequencing studies relevant to vaccinology, we discuss some general considerations how the field could be enriched with the widespread adoption of this technology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anisodamine hydrobromide injection (AHI), the main ingredient of which is anisodamine, is a listed drug for improving microcirculation in China. Anisodamine can improve the condition of patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods. Protein-protein interactions obtained from the String databases were used to construct the protein interaction network (PIN) of AHI using Cytoscape. The crucial targets of AHI PIN were screened by calculating three topological parameters. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The intersection between the AHI component proteins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) coexpression proteins was analyzed. We further investigated our predictions of crucial targets by performing molecular docking studies with anisodamine. Results. The PIN of AHI, including 172 nodes and 1454 interactions, was constructed. A total of 54 crucial targets were obtained based on topological feature calculations. The results of Gene Ontology showed that AHI could regulate cell death, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune system processes. KEGG disease pathways were mainly enriched in viral infections, cancer, and immune system diseases. Between AHI targets and ACE2 coexpression proteins, 26 common proteins were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that anisodamine bound well to all the crucial targets. Conclusion. The network pharmacological strategy integrated molecular docking to explore the mechanism of action of AHI against COVID-19. It provides protein targets associated with COVID-19 that may be further tested as therapeutic targets of anisodamine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inflammation and pain are devastating conditions characterizing many diseases. Their manifestation ranges from mild body discomfort, to a debilitating experience, which may culminate in organ failure or death. In conventional medicine, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants are utilized to manage symptoms related to pain and inflammation. Despite their reported successes, these agents are only palliative, debatably inaccessible, unaffordable, and cause many undesirable side effects. As a result, the search for alternative and complementary therapies is warranted. Medicinal plants have been intensively utilized by humans for a long time to treat various ailments. In spite of their reported efficacies, empirical scientific data supporting their healing claims is scanty. P. thonningii (Schumach.) has been used in African traditional medicine, especially by traditional herbalists in Nigeria and Kenya, to treat conditions associated with inflammation. Even though analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and toxicity studies have been performed on leaf extracts, and some of their isolated compounds in Nigeria, there is scanty data supporting the use of stem bark extracts, which are commonly utilized in Kenya for pain, and inflammation management. Moreover, scientific data regarding safety and toxicity of the stem bark extracts of P. thonningii utilized in Kenya by traditional herbalists are inadequate. Based on this background, acute oral toxicity evaluation of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of P. thonningii, in Swiss albino mice, was performed according to the OECD/OCDE (2008) guidelines. Anti-inflammatory activities were investigated using the xylene-induced ear oedema in mice, whereas analgesic activities were examined following the acetic acid-induced writhing technique. The acute oral toxicity data was analyzed, and interpreted according to the OECDE (2008) guidelines. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities data were tabulated on MS Excel, and exported to GraphPad Prism (v8.3). Descriptive statistics were computed, and expressed as mean ± SEM. Thereafter, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test was performed. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the studied plant extracts had LD50 values &gt; 2000 mg/kg bw, and were hence deemed to be nontoxic according to OECD/OCDE document no. 425. The results showed that the acetic acid-induced writhing frequency in mice administered the aqueous stem bark extract of P. thonningii, at a dose of 500 mg/kg bw, was not significantly different from that recorded for mice which received the reference drug (acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg) (p&gt;0.05). Additionally, at all the studied extract doses, significantly lower acetic acid-induced writhing frequencies were recorded in mice that received the aqueous stem bark extract of P. thonningii, compared with the writhing frequencies in mice that received the methanolic extract of the same plant (p&lt;0.05). On the other hand, the aqueous stem bark extract of P. thonningii, at doses of 100 mg/kg bw and 500 mg/kg bw, and the methanolic stem bark extract of the same plant, at a dose level of 500 mg/kg bw, exhibited significantly higher percentage inhibitions of xylene-induced oedema than the percentage inhibitions shown by the reference drug (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg bw) (p&lt;0.05). Generally, the aqueous stem bark extract of P. thonningii, at all the studied dose levels, caused significantly higher inhibitions of xylene-induced ear oedema in mice, compared with the percentage inhibitions shown by methanolic stem bark (p&lt;0.05). Therefore, the aqueous, and methanolic stem bark extracts of P. thonningii, grown in Kenya, possess peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in Swiss albino mice. Hence, they have a potential of offering safe analgesic, and anti-inflammatory compounds. Further studies aimed at isolating, elucidating, and characterizing bioactive components from the studied extracts are recommended. Moreover, specific mode(s) through which these extracts exert the reported bioactivities should be established. Further toxicological investigations involving the studied plant extracts are encouraged to fully establish their safety.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on typical water-rich sandy gravel strata in Beijing, in order to explore the application of the artificial ground freezing method (AGF) in urban large-scale underground engineering, the formation and development of freezing body were analyzed when multirow freezing pipes were working together, and the group effect exhibited during the freezing process was also revealed in this paper. On this basis, the basin-shaped freezing method (BFM) is put forward as an application of AGF used in underground engineering. BFM structure consists of two parts: the frozen curtain (basin wall) around the excavation scope and the horizontal frozen body (basin bottom) at the bottom of the station. Physical model test and numerical simulation were conducted to study temperature field expansion of BFM under two different conditions. The results show the following: (1) The group effect refers to the cooling effect of different freezing pipes influencing each other during freezing process. Under the condition of still water, the group effect expands the freezing area, and it shows the gradual development of freezing from back water surface to front water surface under seepage condition. (2) BFM can effectively play the role of water proofing, and although different parts of basin structure show different frozen order under different conditions, both basin wall and basin bottom can form an effective thickness during the freezing process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To explore whether acupuncture and moxibustion can prevent disease progression of advanced gastric cancer patients completing second-line chemotherapy and, if so, the related mechanism. Method. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were main outcome measures. The real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of genes including T-bet, IFN-γ, GATA3, and IL-4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). IL-4, IL-6, Ca199, CRP, and IFN-γ in plasma levels were checked. Results. 170 patients were randomly assigned in a 3 : 2 ratio to receive either acupuncture and moxibustion or sham acupuncture until progression. 135 patients were included in the primary analysis. Both PFS and OS in treatment group were proven to be better than control group. Acupuncture and moxibustion promoted typical Th1 cells drifting, as confirmed by increased T-bet/IFN-γ and decreased GATA3/IL-4 in mRNA levels from PBMCs, as well as upregulating IFN-γ and downregulating IL-4 in plasma levels. IL-6, Ca199, and CRP in plasma levels were also reduced by acupuncture and moxibustion. Conclusions. Acupuncture and moxibustion can prolong PFS and OS of advanced gastric cancer patients completing second-line chemotherapy by reversing Th1/Th2 shift and attenuating inflammatory responses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Successive earthquakes of Kocaeli and Duzce within three months indicated that even the survived lifeline structures such as bridges under the former event may have damage or collapse potential under the latter event due to their possible stiffness degradation. It is thus important that a rigorous seismic analysis of such structures should account for the effect of prior earthquake damage. For this purpose, nonlinear seismic analysis of a reinforced concrete bridge structure has been carried out under both single and multiple earthquake ground motions. Behavior and response evaluation of the bridge piers subjected to such motions have been discussed in terms of using both flexure-axial and flexure-shear-axial interaction models. Analytical results show that the stiffness degradation under multiple earthquake ground motions is more pronounced than that under single earthquake ground motion. In addition, comparison of the response without and with shear demonstrates that shear deformation is of significance. The response with shear exhibits the increase in displacement demand and decrease in lateral force carrying capacity, leading to a decrease in energy dissipation capacity. It is concluded that seismic analysis of reinforced concrete bridge structure should account for the effect of multiple earthquake ground motions to assess the demand on such structure properly.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hendrik Baumann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>For dealing numerically with the infinite-state-space Markov chains, a truncation of the state space is inevitable, that is, an approximation by a finite-state-space Markov chain has to be performed. In this paper, we consider level-dependent quasi-birth-death processes, and we focus on the computation of stationary expectations. In previous literature, efficient methods for computing approximations to these characteristics have been suggested and established. These methods rely on truncating the process at some level N, and for N⟶∞, convergence of the approximation to the desired characteristic is guaranteed. This paper’s main goal is to quantify the speed of convergence. Under the assumption of an f-modulated drift condition, we derive terms for a lower bound and an upper bound on stationary expectations which converge quickly to the same value and which can be efficiently computed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Podoconiosis is one of the neglected tropical diseases, and it is a nonfilarial elephantiasis caused by prolonged barefoot exposure to irritant soil. This is manifested by slowly progressive swelling of the foot and lower leg which may lead to an irreversible disability among affected people. Podoconiosis is an entirely noncommunicable preventable disease with a low-cost preventive mechanism. This study is aimed at assessing the magnitude and factor affecting Podoconiosis in Waghmra zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia, 2019. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 808 household members. A multistage sampling method was used to select study participants. A pretested semistructured questionnaire, observation, and clinical screening were used to collect data. The data were entered using EpiData version 4.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 24.0. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with Podoconiosis. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance; in multivariable analysis, variables with a P value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Result. According this study’s results, 4.3% of study participants were affected by Podoconiosis. A family number of four and above [AOR=3.29, 95% CI (1.013-10.661)], family income of less than 500 ETB [AOR=3.69, 95% CI (1.271-10.727)], distance from a health facility greater than 3 km [AOR=6.69, 95% CI (1.610-27.863)], no shoe wearing habits [AOR=5.02, 95% CI (1.969-12.778)], age at first wearing of shoes at 10 and above [AOR=4.46, 95% CI (1.792-11.102)], and no feet washing habits [AOR=3.87, 95% CI (1.516-9.883)] are significant factors of Podoconiosis. Conclusion. Creating awareness about the importance of shoe wearing, feet hygiene, and building infrastructure such as a road, health facility, and water supply were essential preventive strategies. Training about early diagnosis and effective management of lymphedema, giving emphasis on hygiene education and sanitation program, and reporting any suspected Podoconiosis case as early as possible are some of the recommendations forwarded.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Environmental noise has a major negative impact, causing interference for people to communicate, rest, sleep, and general annoyance. In order to control urban environmental noise, simulation-based optimisation for urban environmental noise is conducted. On the basis of the current acoustic environment of Zhaohui Campus of Zhejiang University of Technology, three optimisation plans that include noise barrier optimisation, greenbelt optimisation, and a combination optimisation of noise barrier and greenbelt are proposed. These scenarios are simulated using NoiseSystem software to obtain their ability to reduce noise and determine auditory perception by using different control measures. To determine the visual perception of the optimisation plan, 100 people of different age groups were randomly selected, and each person scored the noise barrier and the greenbelt in the simulated scenarios. Results of the comprehensive evaluation of auditory and visual perception show that noise barriers can provide better auditory feelings, but greenbelts can provide a better auditory and visual subjective experience. Therefore, in addition to the application of noise control measures, their visual design must be fully considered. Moreover, the visual perception of plants is stronger than that of others.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>En-Guo Gu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper aims to extend the model developed by Tramontana et al. By adding trend followers who pay attention to the most recent observed price trend, we formulate a financial market model driven by a new two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear (PWL) map with three branches. The dynamic behavior of the mapping system is studied in two cases according to different trend followers’ expectation of the stock price. The existence and stability conditions of periodic attractors and other bounded attractors are derived by using qualitative and quantitative methods, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulation. When trend followers are neutral on the stock market, we present that the basin of locally attracting fixed points can be determined by the preimages of two borderlines. We also prove that one of its surprising features is that model simulations may appear to be chaotic, although only regular dynamics can emerge. When trend followers are bullish or bearish on the stock market, we present the existence conditions of attracting coexistence fixed point, globally and locally attracting fixed point, and periodic and other bounded attractors. The transversal homoclinic theory of flip saddle periodic point is applied to prove the existence of chaotic attractor. We also give the calculation methods of border collision bifurcation (BCB) curves. This paper advances our knowledge of discontinuous PWL systems and reveals the endogenous evolution of bubbles and crashes and excessive volatility in financial markets from a new perspective with new methods.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Kawira Millien</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Performance of organic oils in solar thermal collection is limited due to their low thermal conductivity when they are compared to molten salt solutions. Extraction of organic oils from plants can be locally achieved. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of use of copper nanoparticles in some base local heat transfer fluids (HTFs). Addition of volume fraction of 1.2% of the copper nanoparticles to oil-based heat transfer fluids improved their thermal conductivity as deduced from the thermal heat they conducted from solar radiation. The oil-based copper nanofluids were obtained by preparation of a colloidal solution of the nanoparticles. Impurities were added to increase the boiling point of the nano-heat transfer fluids. Stabilizers were used to keep the particles suspended in the oil-based fluids. The power output of the oil-based copper nano-heat transfer fluids was in the range of 475.4 W to 1130 W. The heat capacity of the steam in the heat exchanger was 93.7% dry and had a thermal capacity of 5.71 × 103 kJ. The heat rate of flow of the oil-based copper nano-heat transfer fluids was an average of 72.7 Js−1·kg−1 to 89.1 Js−1·kg−1. The thermal efficiency for the oil-based copper nano-heat transfer fluids ranged from 0.85 to 0.91. The average solar thermal solar intensity was in the range 700 Wm−2 to 1180 Wm−2. The heat exchanger used in this study was operating at 4.15 × 103 kJ and a temperature of 500.0°C. The heat transfer fluids entered the exchanger at an average temperature of 381°C and exited at 96.3°C and their heat coefficient ranged between 290.1 Wm−2°C and 254.1 Wm−2°C. The average temperatures of operation ranged between 394.1°C and 219.7°C with respective temperature efficiencies ranging between 93.4% and 64.4%. It was established that utilization of copper nanoparticles to enhance heat transfer in oil-based local heat transfer fluids can mitigate energy demand for meeting the world’s increasing energy uses, especially for areas inaccessible due to poor land terrain.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between stromal cell-derived factor 2-like 1 (SDF2L1) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). 12 NPC tissues and 12 chronic nasopharyngitis tissues were involved in our study. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot were utilized to detect the expression of SDF2L1. Besides, immunofluorescence analysis was utilized to determine the protein expression of 97 paraffin-embedded NPC tissues and 58 nasopharyngitis tissues. Biological functional experiment included Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, cell clone formation assay, cell scratch migration assay, Transwell migration assay, and Transwell invasion assay. All data were analyzed by SPSS. Results showed that downexpression of SDF2L1 was prominently present in NPC tissues and cells. Furthermore, silencing the expression of SDF2L1 promoted NPC proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while overexpression of SDF2L1 has the opposite effect. In conclusion, SDF2L1 may act as a cancer suppressor gene, play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of NPC, and be a new therapeutic target or prognostic indicator for NPC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Emodin is an active monomer extracted from rhubarb root, which has many biological functions, including anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anticancer, and neuroprotection. However, the protective effect of emodin on nerve injury needs to be further elucidated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of emodin on the neuroprotection and the special molecular mechanism. Here, the protective activity of emodin inhibiting H2O2-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation as well as its molecular mechanisms was examined using human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells). The results showed that emodin significantly enhanced cell viability, reduced cell apoptosis and LDH release. Simultaneously, emodin downregulated H2O2-induced inflammatory factors, including IL-6, NO, and TNF-α, and alleviated H2O2-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, emodin inhibited the activation of the PI3K/mTOR/GSK3β signaling pathway. What is more, the PI3K/mTOR/GSK3β pathway participated in the protective mechanism of emodin on H2O2-induced cell damage. Collectively, it suggests that emodin alleviates H2O2-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation potentially by regulating the PI3K/mTOR/GSK3β signaling pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Chronic kidney disease is a global health problem with serious adverse effects, including kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Improving awareness and practice on the impact, prevention, and early detection of chronic kidney disease will reduce the significant economic and public health burden. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine knowledge and practice towards prevention and early detection of chronic kidney disease and its associated factors among hypertensive patients in Gondar town in 2019. The study included hypertensive patients visiting health institutions from February to March 2019. Data was collected using a semistructured questionnaire and individuals who fulfilled our inclusion criteria were selected using a systemic random sampling technique. Epi Info software version 7 was used for data entry, and SPSS version 20 was used for descriptive and logistic regression analysis. Result. Out of a total of 442 participants, 434 completed the questionnaire, with a response rate of 98.1%. Of the total, 298 (68.7%) had good knowledge of chronic kidney disease with a mean knowledge score of 8.78 ± 2.80 and 210 (48.4%) had good practice with mean practice score of 6.58 ± 1.61. Educational status, residence, and duration of hypertension were significantly associated with the knowledge and practice scores of the participants in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion. More than half of the participants had good knowledge about chronic kidney disease and its risk factors. However, the level of preventive practice among participants was low. The educational status, residence, and duration of hypertension were significantly associated variables with knowledge and practice scores in multivariate logistic regression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Firework-related eye injury is a horrible medical problem and creates huge health and social burdens. Herein, we explored the changing trends and demographic and clinical features of firework-related eye injury, in an effort to inform strategies to prevent this injury. We reviewed the data of 468 hospitalized patients who underwent surgery for firework-related eye injury at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center between January 2013 and December 2017. During this period, the trend in firework-related eye injuries was stable (mean, 93 ± 14 cases per year), and fireworks were the major cause of explosive eye injury. The average age of the patients was 24 ± 18 years and 87% of the patients were male, with boys under 10 years of age comprising the largest group (27% of patients). There were an average of 24 ± 7 cases per year from urban areas and 70 ± 8 cases from rural areas (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, 21 ± 5% of cases occurred during Spring Festival. After treatment, the best corrected visual acuity was increased compared to that before treatment, and the intraocular pressure tended to become normal by the final visit (P&lt;0.05). The top three diagnoses were cataract (39%), retinal detachment (18%), and choroidal detachment (14%). Additionally, the most common surgery was cataract extraction (25%), followed by pars plana vitrectomy (19%) and pars plana vitrectomy plus pars plana lensectomy (10%). Over the five-year study period, day surgery hospitalization increased from 1% to 32%. This was associated with a corresponding decrease in the length of hospitalization, without adverse events, demonstrating that day surgery is feasible in firework-related eye injury cases. The present study results suggest that greater attention should be paid to firework-related eye injury, and a variety of measures should be taken to prevent this kind of ocular tragedy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Currently, surgeons in operating rooms are forced to focus their attention both on the patient’s body and on flat low-quality surgical monitors, in order to get all the information needed to successfully complete surgeries. The way the data are displayed leads to disturbances of the surgeon’s visuals, which may affect his performances, besides the fact that other members of the surgical team do not have proper visual tools able to aid him. The idea underlying this paper is to exploit mixed reality to support surgeons during surgical procedures. In particular, the proposed experimental setup, employed in the operating room, is based on an architecture that put together the Microsoft HoloLens, a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) player and a mixed reality visualization tool (i.e., Spectator View) developed by using the Mixed Reality Toolkit in Unity with Windows 10 SDK. The suggested approach enables visual information on the patient’s body as well as information on the results of medical screenings to be visualized on the surgeon’s headsets. Additionally, the architecture enables any data and details to be shared by the team members or by external users during surgical operations. The paper analyses in detail advantages and drawbacks that the surgeons have found when they wore the Microsoft HoloLens headset during all the ten open abdomen surgeries conducted at the IRCCS Hospital “Giovanni Paolo II” in the city of Bari (Italy). A survey based on Likert scale demonstrates how the use of the suggested tools can increase the execution speed by allowing multitasking procedures, i.e., by checking medical images at high resolution without leaving the operating table and the patient. On the other hand, the survey also reveals an increase in the physical stress and reduced comfort due to the weight of the Microsoft HoloLens device, along with drawbacks due to the battery autonomy. Additionally, the survey seems to encourage the use of DICOM Viewer and Spectator View both for surgical education and for improving surgery outcomes. Note that the real use of the conceived platform in the operating room represents a remarkable feature of this paper, since most if not all the studies conducted so far in literature exploit mixed reality only in simulated environments and not in real operating rooms. In conclusion, the study clearly highlights that, despite the challenges required in the forthcoming years to improve the current technology, mixed reality represents a promising technique that will soon enter the operating rooms to support surgeons during surgical procedures in many hospitals across the world.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The development of Internet and social media contributes to multiplying the data produced on the Internet and the connected nodes, but the default installation and the configuration of variety of software systems represent some security holes and shortcomings, while the majority of Internet users have not really set up safety awareness, leading to huge security risks. With the development of network attack techniques, every host on the Internet has become the target of attacks. Therefore, the network information security cannot be ignored as a problem. To deal with 0-day and future attacks, the honeypot technique can be used not only passively as an information system, but also to reinforce the traditional defense systems against future attacks. In this paper, we present an introduction of machine learning and honeypot systems, and based on these technologies, we design a smart agent for cyber-attack prevention and prediction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Prompt and correct diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules has always been a core issue in the clinical practice of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound imaging is one of the most common visualizing tools used by radiologists to identify the nature of thyroid nodules. However, visual assessment of nodules is difficult and often affected by inter- and intraobserver variabilities. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach based on machine learning and information fusion to discriminate the nature of thyroid nodules. Statistical features are extracted from the B-mode ultrasound image while deep features are extracted from the shear-wave elastography image. Classifiers including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine are adopted to train classification models with statistical features and deep features, respectively, for comparison. A voting system with certain criteria is used to combine two classification results to obtain a better performance. Experimental and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method classifies the thyroid nodules correctly and efficiently.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Defects such as voids, pores, and joints will transform into big scale cracks in the rock of tunnel surrounding under dynamic load like blasting and earthquake. In this paper, three kinds of symmetrical cracks were chosen as an example, and experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to study the effect of symmetric cracks on a blast-induced crack. The relationship of main crack propagation characteristic and distribution of symmetrical cracks was investigated. Some circular specimens using two kinds of material, PMMA and sandstone, including a center hole charged with a detonator and pre-existing cracks were used in the experiments. The test system consisted of an oscilloscope and an ultradynamic strain amplifier and crack propagation gauges (CPGs) were employed in monitoring propagation velocity. AUTODYN code was applied in numerical simulation to investigate the propagation behavior of main crack between symmetrical cracks. Linear equation of state and a modified major principal stress failure criterion was utilized to describe the status of rock material. Based on experimental and numerical results, it can be concluded that (1) the pre-existing symmetrical cracks have arrest effect on main crack propagation, (2) compressive stress in y-direction plays very important roles in crack arrest, and (3) the spacing of parallel cracks has a great influence on crack propagation length and velocity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study assessed the molecular mechanism of selenium (Se) protecting against kidney injury induced by zearalenone (ZEA) in mice. The experimental mice were divided into 4 groups including the control group, the Se group, the ZEA group, and the Se+ZEA group; ZEA and Se were administered orally for 28 days. The changes in renal biochemical index (BUN, UA, and CRE), biochemical change of kidney damage such as BUN, UA, and CRE, and oxidative damage such as MDA, T-SOD, and GSH-Px were investigated. Pathological sections and TUNEL staining were used to analyze renal pathological changes and cell apoptosis. qRT-PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of genes and proteins which were related with endoplasmic reticulum stress. The results showed that ZEA increased the concentration of BUN, UA, and CRE and the content of MDA and decreased the activities of T-SOD and GSH-Px in the mouse kidneys. However, Se reversed above changes of the biochemical and antioxidant indexes of renal injury. Moreover, the results also showed that ZEA can increase the expression of Bax, caspase-12, caspase-3, Bip, CHOP, JNK protein, and mRNA and decrease the expression of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA. But Se reversed these proteins and genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. It can be concluded that Se protected against the kidney damage induced by ZEA. Se may protect the kidney from ZEA-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting ERS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to play a pivotal role in diabetic nephropathy (DN). AdipoRon is a newly developed adiponectin receptor agonist that provides beneficial effects for diabetic mice; however, its underlying mechanism remains to be delineated. Here, we demonstrated increased expression levels of ER stress markers, accompanied by upregulated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased expression of collagen I, fibronectin, Bax, and cleaved caspase 3 in the kidneys of db/db mice compared with control mice. Decreased expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and phosphorylated 5′AMP-activated kinase (p-AMPK) was also observed in the kidneys of db/db mice. However, these alterations were partially reversed by intragastric gavage with AdipoRon. In vitro, AdipoRon alleviated high-glucose-induced ER stress, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in HK-2 cells, a human tubular cell line. Moreover, AdipoRon restored the expression of AdipoR1 and p-AMPK in HK-2 cells exposed to high-glucose conditions. Additionally, these effects were partially abrogated by pretreatment with AdipoR1 siRNA, but this abrogation was ameliorated by cotreatment with AICAR, an AMPK activator. Furthermore, the effects of AdipoRon were also partially abolished by cotreatment with compound C. Together, these results suggest that AdipoRon exerts favorable effects on diabetes-induced tubular injury in DN by inhibiting ER stress mediated by the AdipoR1/p-AMPK pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role not only in the pathogenesis of many oxidative stress or age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative as well as mental disorders but also in normal aging. There is evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are the most upstream and common events in the pathomechanisms of neurodegeneration. Cyclopia species are endemic South African plants and some have a long tradition of use as herbal tea, known as honeybush tea. Extracts of the tea are gaining more scientific attention due to their phenolic composition. In the present study, we tested not only the in vitro mitochondria-enhancing properties of honeybush extracts under physiological conditions but also their ameliorative properties under oxidative stress situations. Hot water and ethanolic extracts of C. subternata, C. genistoides, and C. longifolia were investigated. Pretreatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with honeybush extracts, at a concentration range of 0.1-1 ng/ml, had a beneficial effect on bioenergetics as it increased ATP production, respiration, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) after 24 hours under physiological conditions. The aqueous extracts of C. subternata and C. genistoides, in particular, showed a protective effect by rescuing the bioenergetic and mitochondrial deficits under oxidative stress conditions (400 μM H2O2 for 3 hours). These findings indicate that honeybush extracts could constitute candidates for the prevention of oxidative stress with an impact on aging processes and age-related neurodegenerative disorders potentially leading to the development of a condition-specific nutraceutical.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Amyloid β- (Aβ-) induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be a primary process triggering all the cascades of events that lead to AD. Therefore, identification of natural factors and endogenous mechanisms that protect neurons against Aβ toxicity is needed. In the current study, we investigated whether alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), as a natural product, would increase insulin and IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor I) release from astrocytes. Moreover, we explored the protective effect of astrocytes-derived insulin/IGF-I on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, with special attention paid to their impact on mitochondrial function of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed that ALA induced insulin and IGF-I secretion from astrocytes. Our findings demonstrated that astrocyte-derived insulin/insulin-like growth factor I protects differentiated SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ1-42-induced cell death. Moreover, pretreatment with conditioned medium (CM) and ALA-preactivated CM (ALA-CM) protected the SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ1-42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, restoring the balance between fusion and fission processes, and regulation of mitophagy and autophagy processes. Our study suggested that astrocyte-derived insulin/insulin-like growth factor I suppresses Aβ1-42-induced cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cells by protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of CM were intensified by preactivation with ALA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Patients with Cushing’s syndrome (CS) frequently report impairments in cognitive and emotional functioning. Given neuroimaging research that implicates alterations in structure and function in the brain in this population, goals of this study were to investigate neuropsychological and emotional functioning, with particular emphasis on complex attention and memory. In a clinical sample of 18 adults with CS referred for neuropsychological evaluation (age 41.6±10.6, 72% Caucasian), patients’ most common subjective complaints were in attention and increased irritability. On objective testing, patients exhibited significant declines in the consistency of their sustained attention and visual-spatial functioning compared to normative peers. Patients exhibited on average significantly reduced initial learning following first exposure to visual and verbal stimuli but intact retention of information learned. Patients with CS endorsed highly elevated levels of somatization, depression, and anxiety, and 59% of them scored in the clinically elevated range for somatization and depressive symptomatology. Exploratory analyses suggested that the 11 patients with active Cushing’s exhibited lower processing speed, poorer sustained attention, naming, and cognitive flexibility compared to the 7 patients who achieved biochemical remission. Patients with active Cushing’s also reported higher levels of somatization and anxiety compared to patients in biochemical remission. Overall, this study provides new insights into complex attention and memory deficits in patients with CS and concern regarding cognitive and emotional issues despite resolution of hypercortisolism. Our study opens several avenues for further exploration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents the cyclic loading test results of a new type of fired shale hollow block masonry walls. Six specimens were designed including two specimens without reinforcements (bare walls) and four specimens constrained by structural columns (reinforced walls). The influences of aspect ratio, vertical compressive stress, and structural column on the seismic performance of the specimens were investigated. The failure mode, bearing capacity, ductility, stiffness degradation, and energy dissipation of specimens were analyzed. The results showed that the crack patterns of specimens changed from the horizontal straight shape (bare walls) to “X” shape (reinforced walls), and the corresponding bearing capacity, ductility, stiffness degradation, and energy dissipation of the specimens were improved. With the increase of the vertical compressive stress, the ductility and the secant stiffness of the specimens increased. Moreover, with the decrease of aspect ratio, the bearing capacity and secant stiffness of the masonry walls increased, while the energy dissipation capacity decreased. This paper confirms that fired shale hollow block walls could meet the seismic requirements through appropriate design, which could promote the application of this new type of block in civil engineering.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Nyan M. Aung</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction. Incomplete understanding of the root canal system leads to endodontic failure. Missed canal was the fourth most common endodontic failure, which needed retreatment. There were a few studies on internal morphology of posterior teeth of Myanmar population. However, there was no report on root canal anatomy of anterior teeth. So, the aim of the in vitro study was to investigate root canal anatomy of Myanmar permanent mandibular incisors in Mandalay Region by the staining and clearing method. Materials and Methods. A total of 96 teeth from the tertiary hospitals and one academic department in Mandalay Region were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, they were cleaned, drilled, stained with Indian ink, and decalcified with 5% nitric acid for 3 days. After that, they were dehydrated with ascending concentration of ethanol (80% overnight, 90% for 1 hour, and full strength for three hours). Finally, they were clarified with 98% methyl salicylate and investigated by calibrated observer in case of Vertucci’s classification, allocation of apical foramen, and the detailed anatomy. Result. Almost 70% of the teeth had type Ι followed by 21.8% type ΙΙΙ, 4% 1-2-1-2-1 and type ΙΙ, and 1-3-2 and 2-3-1 comprised 1% each. Nearly 70% of apical foramen at central allocation of the root and 14% of detailed anatomy were seen in the sample teeth. Conclusion. Most of the sampled Myanmar teeth comprised one canal and one foramen followed by type ΙΙΙ. However, unusual anatomies, such as 1-2-1-2-1, 1-3-2, and 2-3-1, were also seen. Contrastively, proportions of central location of apical foramen and of detailed anatomy were differed from the former reports. This study summarized that 3 in 10 mandibular incisors comprised the evidence of second or third canal configuration. Three types of intercanal calcifications, fusiform, islet, and bead, were additionally explored.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Insomnia inflicts mental burden and decreases physical productivity and affects life quality. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (ta-VNS) may be an effective treatment option for insomnia. This study aims to evaluate the effect and safety of ta-VNS and compare it with transcutaneous nonvagus nerve stimulation (tn-VNS). A multicenter, randomized, clinical trial was conducted at 3 hospitals in China enrolling 72 insomnia participants from May 2016 to June 2017. Participants were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive 40 sessions of ta-VNS or tn-VNS treatment. 63 participants completed the trial. ta-VNS treatment significantly decreased the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, Flinders Fatigue Scale score, Hamilton Depression Scale score, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale score over 4 weeks compared with those of the baseline. Moreover, it also significantly increased the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire scores compared with that of the baseline. However, it did not show significant differences compared with tn-VNS in changes of primary and secondary outcomes. The incidence of adverse events was low. ta-VNS significantly relieved insomnia over 4 weeks. Moreover, it also alleviated fatigue and improved participants’ quality of life as well as other concomitant symptoms such as depression and anxiety. This trial is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) with the registration number: ChiCTR-TRC-13003519.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A new clustering membrane system using a complex chained P system (CCP) based on evolutionary mechanism is designed, developed, implemented, and tested. The purpose of CCP is to solve clustering problems. In CCP, two kinds of evolution rules in different chained membranes are used to enhance the global search ability. The first kind of evolution rules using traditional and modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) clustering techniques are used to evolve the objects. Another based on differential evolution (DE) is introduced to further improve the global search ability. The communication rules are adopted to accelerate the convergence and avoid prematurity. Under the control of evolution-communication mechanism, the CCP can effectively search for the optimal partitioning and improve the clustering performance with the help of the distributed parallel computing model. This proposed CCP is compared with four existing PSO clustering approaches on eight real-life datasets to verify the validity. The computational results on tested images also clearly show the effectiveness of CCP in solving image segmentation problems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In image denoising (IDN) processing, the low-rank property is usually considered as an important image prior. As a convex relaxation approximation of low rank, nuclear norm-based algorithms and their variants have attracted a significant attention. These algorithms can be collectively called image domain-based methods whose common drawback is the requirement of great number of iterations for some acceptable solution. Meanwhile, the sparsity of images in a certain transform domain has also been exploited in image denoising problems. Sparsity transform learning algorithms can achieve extremely fast computations as well as desirable performance. By taking both advantages of image domain and transform domain in a general framework, we propose a sparsifying transform learning and weighted singular values minimization method (STLWSM) for IDN problems. The proposed method can make full use of the preponderance of both domains. For solving the nonconvex cost function, we also present an efficient alternative solution for acceleration. Experimental results show that the proposed STLWSM achieves improvement both visually and quantitatively with a large margin over state-of-the-art approaches based on an alternatively single domain. It also needs much less iteration than all the image domain algorithms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Renewable energy (RE) systems play a key role in producing electricity worldwide. The integration of RE systems is carried out in a distributed aspect via an autonomous hybrid microgrid (A-HMG) system. The A-HMG concept provides a series of technological solutions that must be managed optimally. As a solution, this paper focuses on the application of a recent nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm named a multimodal delayed particle swarm optimization (MDPSO). The proposed algorithm is applied to an A-HMG to find the minimum levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the lowest loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and the maximum renewable factor (REF). Firstly, a smart energy management scheme (SEMS) is proposed to coordinate the power flow among the various system components that formed the A-HMG. Then, the MDPSO is integrated with the SEMS to perform the optimal sizing for the A-HMG of a fishing village that is located in the coastal city of Essaouira, Morocco. The proposed A-HMG comprises photovoltaic panels (PV), wind turbines (WTs), battery storage systems, and diesel generators (DGs). The results of the optimization in this location show that A-HMG system can be applied for this location with a high renewable factor that is equal to 90%. Moreover, the solution is very promising in terms of the LCOE and the LPSP indexes that are equal to 0.17$/kWh and 0.12%, respectively. Therefore, using renewable energy can be considered as a good alternative to enhance energy access in remote areas as the fishing village in the city of Essaouira, Morocco. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is applied to highlight the impact of varying each energy source in terms of the LCOE index.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bird swarm algorithm is one of the swarm intelligence algorithms proposed recently. However, the original bird swarm algorithm has some drawbacks, such as easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence speed. To overcome these short-comings, a dynamic multi-swarm differential learning quantum bird swarm algorithm which combines three hybrid strategies was established. First, establishing a dynamic multi-swarm bird swarm algorithm and the differential evolution strategy was adopted to enhance the randomness of the foraging behavior’s movement, which can make the bird swarm algorithm have a stronger global exploration capability. Next, quantum behavior was introduced into the bird swarm algorithm for more efficient search solution space. Then, the improved bird swarm algorithm is used to optimize the number of decision trees and the number of predictor variables on the random forest classification model. In the experiment, the 18 benchmark functions, 30 CEC2014 functions, and the 8 UCI datasets are tested to show that the improved algorithm and model are very competitive and outperform the other algorithms and models. Finally, the effective random forest classification model was applied to actual oil logging prediction. As the experimental results show, the three strategies can significantly boost the performance of the bird swarm algorithm and the proposed learning scheme can guarantee a more stable random forest classification model with higher accuracy and efficiency compared to others.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Text classification plays an important role in various applications of big data by automatically classifying massive text documents. However, high dimensionality and sparsity of text features have presented a challenge to efficient classification. In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing- (CS-) based model to speed up text classification. Using CS to reduce the size of feature space, our model has a low time and space complexity while training a text classifier, and the restricted isometry property (RIP) of CS ensures that pairwise distances between text features can be well preserved in the process of dimensionality reduction. In particular, by structural random matrices (SRMs), CS is free from computation and memory limitations in the construction of random projections. Experimental results demonstrate that CS effectively accelerates the text classification while hardly causing any accuracy loss.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the development of society, more and more attention has been paid to cultural festivals. In addition to the government’s emphasis, the increasing consumption in festivals also proves that cultural festivals are playing increasingly important role in public life. Therefore, it is very vital to grasp the public festival sentiment. Text sentiment analysis is an important research content in the field of machine learning in recent years. However, at present, there are few studies on festival sentiment, and sentiment classifiers are also limited by domain or language. The Chinese text classifier is much less than the English version. This paper takes Sina Weibo as the text information carrier and Chinese festival microblogs as the research object. CHN-EDA is used to do Chinese text data augmentation, and then the traditional classifiers CNN, DNN, and naïve Bayes are compared to obtain a higher accuracy. The matching optimizer is selected, and relevant parameters are determined through experiments. This paper solves the problem of unbalanced Chinese sentiment data and establishes a more targeted festival text classifier. This festival sentiment classifier can collect public festival emotion effectively, which is beneficial for cultural inheritance and business decisions adjustment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on the price-quantity adjustment behaviour principle of the non-Walrasian equilibrium theory, this paper adopted a new QUE (quantity adjustment user equilibrium) criterion to formulate the route comfort choice behaviour. The purpose of the present paper is to establish a proportional-switch adjustment model which aims to reflect the route adjustment behaviour interaction between the traditional UE (user equilibrium) travellers and the QUE travellers and converge to a mixed equilibrium state. It is assumed that a group of road network travellers follow the UE criteria by choosing the travel route with the purpose of minimizing their route travel time (travel cost). In addition, the other group of travellers follow the QUE criteria by selecting the route with the largest residual capacity to achieve a more comfortable travel experience. The travel route adjustment behaviour of the two group travellers generates the dynamic traffic flow evolution towards the mixed equilibrium, and the route adjusting flow is proportional to the difference of traveller decision-making variable among the alternative routes. Simple illustrative examples are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, and the uniqueness and stability of the solution are demonstrated by applying the variational inequality and Lyapunov stability theorem.</dc:description>

<dc:description>PPARD has been suggested to contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) with the underlying mechanisms largely unknown. Here, we first collected and analyzed the PPARD expression profile from three groups: (1) 18 healthy control (HC) subjects, (2) 14 clinical high-risk (CHR) patients, and (3) 19 early onset of SCZ (EOS) patients. After that, we conducted a systematical pathway analysis to explore the potential mechanisms involved in PPARD exerting influence on the pathological development of SCZ. Compared to the HC group, the expression of PPARD was slightly decreased in the EOS group (LFC=−0.34; p=0.23) and increased in the CHR group (LFC=0.65; p=0.20). However, there was a significant difference between the EOS group and the CHR group (LFC=−0.99; p=0.015), reflecting the amount of variation in PPARD expression before and after the onset of SCZ. Pathway analysis suggested that overexpression of PPARD may regulate ten proteins or molecules to inhibit the pathological development of SCZ, including the deactivation of eight SCZ promoters and stimulation of two SCZ inhibitors. Our results support the association between PPARD and SCZ. The pathways identified may help in the understanding of the potential mechanisms by which PPARD contributes to the etiology of SCZ.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study presents two monozygotic twins (MZ) with multiple impacted teeth, affecting the upper canines and lower second molars, as well as congenital aniridia. The clinical aspect of the upper canines is peculiar because of the different positions—palatal in one and buccal in the other twin. Studies reporting different scenarios of impaction in monozygotic twins can contribute more data to the debate on tooth eruption aetiology and more so in this case because of the association with a genetic panocular disease. Patients’ Concerns. The patients were referred by a general dentist, who diagnosed the presence of multiple inclusions. Diagnostic Study. Both patients showed severe malocclusion, classified as grade 5 of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). The MZ showed class I malocclusion, upper and lower crowding, and impacted lower right and left second molars. A Dentascan was prescribed for the canine impaction. The impaction of the upper canine was palatal of 2.3 in one of the MZ and buccal of 1.3 in the other one. The same altered pattern of eruption of the lower second molars was identified in both twins. The proposed treatment plan contemplated orthodontic surgical recovery of the impacted elements, followed by orthodontic treatment with multibracket appliance after the extraction of the first four premolars, given the crowding entity. The use of a retraction spring action was chosen for the recovery of the lower second molars. Many aspects of the possible genetic aetiology of tooth impaction are still under discussion. The study of diseases in twins offers decisive information. Finally, the possibility that alterations in the eruptive pattern of the dental elements may be associated with other congenital problems broadens the range of investigations related to the possible aetiological causes of the inclusions in humans.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide with pleiotropic effects in systemic inflammation. Its more stable precursor protein midregional proadrenomedullin (MRproADM) can be measured more reliably compared to ADM. Our objective was to investigate the potential role of MRproADM as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients at the intensive care unit (ICU). We therefore measured MRproADM in 203 ICU patients and 66 healthy controls. We found that MRproADM levels are significantly increased in critically ill patients as compared to healthy controls. MRproADM levels are significantly increased in patients with sepsis, but its diagnostic value for identifying sepsis is numerically lower than that of established markers (e.g., interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin). MRproADM levels are closely correlated to endothelial and organ dysfunction, inflammation, and established clinical scores (APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS2). MRproADM concentrations correlate with vasopressor use but not fluid balance. Increased MRproADM levels (cut−off&gt;1.4 nmol/L) in critically ill patients are independent predictors of ICU and overall mortality during a follow-up of up to 26 months (OR 3.15 for ICU mortality, 95% CI 1.08-9.20, p=0.036; OR for overall mortality 2.4, 95% CI 1.12-5.34, p=0.026). Our study demonstrates the potential of MRproADM serum levels as a prognostic biomarker in critical illness for ICU mortality and long-term survival during follow-up.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. In this study, considering the importance of platelet function in inflammatory processes, we explored whether there are relationships of platelet indices with postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and pain developing after use of spinal needles and whether patient characteristics contribute to the development of PDPH. Methods. This prospective, observational study included 76 patients (Group 1) with PDPH and 93 patients (Group 2) without PDPH. The postoperative hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count (PC), and mean platelet volume (MPV) values were recorded, along with age, blood type, Rh factor, gravida, parity, and gestational age. In addition, the time of the onset of pain was recorded in patients who complained of a postspinal headache. Results. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values in Group 1 were significantly lower than in Group 2 (both, p=0.024). The PC of Group 1 was significantly higher than that of Group 2 (p&lt;0.001), whereas the MPV was significantly lower (p&lt;0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values were significant for hemoglobin, hematocrit, PC, and MPV (p=0.022, p=0.024, p&lt;0.001, and p&lt;0.001, resp.). For MPV, the AUC value was 0.293, sensitivity was 1%, and specificity was 99%. The highest likelihood ratio (LR+) value was 1.22 at a cut-off value of 13.3 fL. For the PC, the AUC value was 0.666, the sensitivity was 9%, and the specificity was 99%, while the highest LR + value was 8.56 at a cut-off value of 352 × 109/L. There was no significant relationship between the parameters examined and the onset of pain. Conclusion. In this study, the PC was higher and MPV was lower in obstetric patients with PDPH compared with the control group. However, we also found that these two values cannot be used as markers of PDPH.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Malignant hyperthermia is a pharmacogenetic disorder in the regulation of calcium in skeletal muscles which is related to an uninhibited muscle hypermetabolic reaction to potent inhalation agents, the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and to stressors such as vigorous exercise and heat. MH is diagnosed by the clinical presentation of the disease and laboratory testing. There are a few previous studies working on if there is an association between the occurrence of malignant hyperthermia and the existence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and there was no report on growth hormone doping in the literature. So, our main goal was to show this rare case of malignant hyperthermia seen in a G6PD patient with growth hormone abuse who underwent surgery and to find if there is an association between G6PD deficiency, growth hormone abuse, and malignant hyperthermia. Our patient was a 17-year-old boy with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness who underwent appendectomy. At the end of the operation, the patient developed with an increased heart rate (sinus tachycardia), increased body temperature and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level, masseter muscle rigidity, and then, generalized body rigidity, so the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility was considered. The patient was managed by cooling down the patient and the administration of dantrolene. We could hypothesize that malignant hyperthermia might be associated with G6PD deficiency as a triggering factor, but has no association with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) abuse. Another main lesson which this study tells us is to make a careful and proper history taking before going on an operation for preoperative evaluation and identification of patients with any form of suspicious drug abuse in order not to receive volatile inhalational agents and, also, performing some preventive measures including avoidance of heat extremes and restricting athletic activity in a patient with a history of malignant hyperthermia, and if the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is suspected, urgent management should be carried out. As the association between G6PD deficiency, human growth hormone abuse, and malignant hyperthermia has remained unclear up-to-date, further potent studies are seriously needed in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Von Hippel–Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome predisposing to a variety of highly vascularised tumors in different organs. Although bilateral pheochromocytoma was reported in patients with von Hippel–Lindau disease, the coexistence of primary hyperparathyroidism is not a common condition. We report an observation of a primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to an ectopic secretion of intact parathyroid hormone in a 17-year-old girl with von Hippel–Lindau disease and bilateral pheochromocytoma. She presented with a newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and a severe arterial hypertension. Blood tests disclosed hypercalcemia with increased intact PTH level. Cervical ultrasound and sestamibi scintigraphy were normal. Twenty-four-hour urinary normetanephrine level was highly elevated pointing to a catecholamine-secreting tumor. The abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral adrenal masses. MIBG scintigraphy exhibited a high accumulation of the tracer in both adrenal tumors. Genetic testing revealed a mutation of the VHL gene. The patient underwent a bilateral adrenalectomy. The postoperative outcome was marked by normalization of blood pressure, blood glucose, calcium, and PTH levels. In our case, the elevation of intact PTH and its spontaneous normalization after surgical treatment of pheochromocytomas confirms its ectopic secretion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Gang-Qing-Ning (GQN) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the folk population for decades. However, scientific validation is still necessary to lend credibility to the traditional use of GQN against HCC. This study investigates the antitumor effect of GQN on H22 tumor-bearing mice and its possible mechanism. Methods. Fifty H22 tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to five groups. Three groups were treated with high, medium, and low dosages of GQN (27.68, 13.84, and 6.92 g/kg, respectively); the positive control group was treated with cytoxan (CTX) (20 mg/kg) and the model group was treated with normal saline. After 10 days’ treatment, the tumor inhibitory rates were calculated. Pathological changes in tumor tissue were observed, and the key proteins and genes of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway were measured, as well as the mRNA expression levels of VEGF in tumor tissue. Results. The tumor inhibitory rates of high, medium, and low dosages of GQN groups were 47.39%, 38.26%, and 22.17%, respectively. The high dosage of the GQN group significantly increased the protein and mRNA expression levels of Bax, Cyt-C, and cleaved Caspase 3 (or Caspase 3) (P&lt;0.01) but decreased the expression levels of Bcl-2, VEGF, and microvessel density (MVD) (P&lt;0.01). Conclusions. The high dosage of GQN can significantly inhibit the tumor growth in H22 tumor-bearing mice. It exerts the antitumor effect by enhancing proapoptotic factors and inhibiting the antiapoptotic factor of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aldosterone regulates the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which is identified as a chronic inflammatory disease by promoting the generation of C-reactive protein in vascular smooth muscle cells. Curcumin is the most active ingredient of turmeric with anti-inflammation and antioxidation effects. Here, the effect of curcumin on aldosterone-induced C-reactive protein generation in vascular smooth muscle and the molecular mechanisms involved were explored. Primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells and hyperaldosteronism model rats were used in this study. The amount of C-reactive protein, reactive oxygen species, and the signaling pathway-related molecules generated were estimated. We found that curcumin inhibited aldosterone-induced C-reactive protein generation in vascular smooth muscle cells by interfering with the reactive oxygen species-ERK1/2 signal pathway. The results provide new evidence for the potential anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective effects of curcumin.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) always have emotional implications. As the branch of traditional Chinese medicine, Five-Animal Frolics Exercise (FAE) is a popular mind-body exercise in China and shown to improve emotional wellbeing. Aim. We aimed to explore the effects of FAE on the emotional disorders of CHD patients. Methods. CHD patients were assigned into an experiment group (EG, FAE) and a control group (CG, routine nursing care). We measured serum levels of miR-124 and miR-135 and scores of the Hamilton Depression/Anxiety scale (HAMD/HAMA), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results. After a 3-month FAE intervention, serum levels of miR-124 and miR-135 and the scores of HAMD/HAMA, SAS, SDS, and PSQI in the EG group were lower than those in the CG group, while SF-36 scores in the EG group were higher than those in the CG group (p&lt;0.05). Serum levels of miR-124 and miR-135 had a strong relationship with SAS and SDS scores (p&lt;0.05). Discussion/Implications for Practice. The study suggests that FAE intervention controls anxiety and depression outcomes and improves life quality in CHD patients by affecting serum levels of miR-124 and miR-135.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Mohammed N. Assaf</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study focuses on the utilization of multispectral satellite images for remote water-quality evaluation of inland water body in Jordan. The geophysical parameters based on water’s optical properties, due to the presence of optically active constituents, are used to determine contaminant level in water. It has a great potential to be employed for continuous and cost-effective water-quality monitoring and leads to a reliable regularly updated tool for better water sector management. Three sets of water samples were collected from three different dams in Jordan. Chl-a concentration of the water samples was measured and used with corresponding Sentinel 2 surface reflectance (SR) data to develop a predictive model. Chl-a concentrations and corresponding SR data were used to calibrate and validate different models. The predictive capability of each of the investigated models was determined in terms of determination coefficient (R2) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values. For the investigated sites, the B3/B2 (green/blue bands) model and the Ln (B3/B2) model showed the best overall predictive capability of all models with the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE values of (0.859, 0.824) and (30.756 mg/m3, 29.787 mg/m3), respectively. The outcome of this study on selected sites can be expanded for future work to cover more sites in the future and ultimately cover all sites in Jordan.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tigernut (Cyperus esculentus Lativum) is an important but understudied and underutilized crop in Ghana. The tubers are highly appreciated for their health benefits and nutritive value. To contribute to the conservation process of tiger nut and identify elite genotypes, this study was conducted to assess phenotypic variability in tiger nut genotypes in Ghana. Sixty-four (64) genotypes were collected from major tiger nut growing areas in Ghana. The genotypes were field-grown and characterized based on phenotypic and yield traits. Similarity coefficient (Bray-Curtis) was between 0.82 and 0.98, indicating low variability in both qualitative and quantitative characters. The cophenetic correlation coefficient was 0.64. The genotypes were mainly brown with only a few black (6) tubers from the central region. Materials collected from parts of the eastern region (Aduamoah) generally recorded the highest tuber weight. Tuber weight depended on plant height and number of tillers. There were high tillering genetic materials among the genotypes. Tubers were categorised as oval (10), ovoid (33), or oblong (15). The genotypes clustered into two groups based on shoot and tuber characteristics, rather than on geographical origin. The low genetic diversity among the genotypes suggested either the possible existence of a network among tiger nut farmers in Ghana in circulating the planting material or some form of seed sorting for uniform and homogenous planting materials has been carried out over the years. Our results point to the imperativeness to expand the genetic base of the tiger nuts to facilitate its improvement in Ghana.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The microseismic signals in the coal minefield are very complex because of its special environment with a large number of blast vibration signals, and how to effectively identify the microseismic signals is still a big problem. S transform (ST) and Manifold Learning (ML) methods are introduced to extract the characteristics of the microseismic signals, and Gaussian Mixture Model based on the improved Bee Colony optimization algorithm (IBC-GMM) is established to identify the microseismic signals accurately. Firstly, the time-frequency characteristics of microseismic signals in coal mine are extracted by ST analysis. It is found that there are obvious time-frequency differences between rock-fracturing signals and blast vibration signals. Blast vibration signals have short duration, high frequency, and complex frequency spectrum, and their dominant frequencies are mainly over 100 Hz. However, rock-fracturing signals are relatively slow, with low frequency and stable spectrum change, and their dominant frequencies are generally below 100 Hz. Then, combining with the microseismic data of Xiashinjie coal mine in Tongchuan, China, the feature dimension reduction is carried out by Manifold Learning (ML) method, and the processed feature vectors are automatically recognized by IBC-GMM. Field test results show that the method summarizes the characteristics of the microseismic wave which are difficult to emerge as the learning vector, and the features reflect the key features of microseismic signals well. The identification accuracy is as high as 94%, and its recognition effect is superior to other recognition models (such as traditional Gaussian Mixture Model based on Expectation-Maximum (EM-GMM), Backpropagation (BP) neural network, Random Forests (RF), Bayes (Bayes) methods, and Logistic Regression (LR) method). Therefore, IBC-GMM could be used to mine engineering microseismic monitoring waveform recognition to provide the reference.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The residual shear strength of liquefied soil is critical to estimating the displacement of lateral spreading. In the paper, an Artificial Neural Network model was trained to predict the residual shear strength ratio based on the case histories of lateral spreading. High-quality case histories were analyzed with Newmark sliding block method. The Artificial Neural Network model was used to predict the residual shear strength of liquefied soil, and the post-liquefaction yield acceleration corresponding with the residual shear strength was obtained by conducting limit equilibrium analysis. Comparing the predicted residual shear strength ratios to the recorded values for different case histories, the correlation coefficient, R, was 0.92 and the mean squared error (MSE) was 0.001 for the predictions by the Artificial Neural Network model. Comparison between the predicted and reported lateral spreading for each high-quality case history was made. The results showed that the probability of the lateral spreading calculated with the Newmark sliding block method using the residual shear strength was 98% if a lateral spreading ratio of 2.0 was expected and a truncated distribution was used. An exponential relationship was proposed to correlate the residual shear strength ratio to the equivalent clean sand corrected SPT blow count of the liquefied soil.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Karst water is widespread throughout China and is heavily influenced by complex geological conditions, and floor inrush of karst waters associated with coal seams is the second most common coal mine disaster in China. Due to the limitation of precision and cost of geophysical exploration technology, the volume and pressure of karst water are challenging to measure, especially during the mining process. Therefore, predicting karst pressure’s response to mining is critical for determining the mechanism of water inrush. Here, closed karst water pressure (CKWP) response to mining was studied in an innovative physical simulation experiment. In the simulation experiment, a capsule and a pipe were designed to reflect CKWP and the water level. In the experiment, the vertical stress and karst water level were monitored throughout the process of an advancing coal panel. Monitoring results show that the range of the abutment pressure was about 40 cm, and the peak coefficient value was about 2. When the working face is far away from the water capsule, the stress and water column near the water capsule have no obvious change. With the working face 10 cm from the water capsule, the stress and water column height increased significantly. When the working face was right above the water capsule, the stress and water column rose sharply and reached the maximum value. When the working face advanced beyond the water capsule, the stress and water column height declined. Through establishing a structural mechanics model, the karst water system underneath the working face is assumed to be a hydraulic press. Accordingly, the compressed area was assumed to be a piston. The karst water pressure increases sharply, while the piston is compressed, increasing water inrush risk. This discovery may help determine the water inrush mechanism from a novel point of view.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cassia siamea leaf has been proven in vitro and in vivo to have a strong antimalarial activity with Cassiarin A as its active compound. To obtain a source of C. siamea medicinal plant with high level of active antimalarial compound (Cassiarin A), a valid method for determining Cassiarin A level is needed. For this reason, this research conducts the validation of the Cassiarin A content with determination method using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) densitometry which includes the determination of selectivity (Rs), linearity (r), accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Cassiarin A was chromatographed on silica gel 60 F254 TLC plate using chloroform : ethanol (85 : 15 v/v) as a mobile phase. Cassiarin A was quantified by densitometric analysis at 368 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r = 0.9995. The method was validated for precision, recovery, repeatability. The minimum detectable amount was found to be 0.0027 μg/spot, whereas the limit of quantitation was found to be 0.008 μg/spot. The results of this validation are then used to determine the Cassiarin A level of C. siamea leaf from various regions in Indonesia. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the TLC-densitometry method can be used to determine level of the Cassiarin A compound with the advantages of being fast, easy, accurate, and inexpensive. In addition, it showed that C. siamea leaves from Pacitan have the highest level of Cassiarin A compared to other areas studied.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The contraction joints of arch dams with and without shear keys are simplified to be with no-slip condition and with relative sliding condition, respectively. Based on the Lagrange multiplier method, a contact model considering the manner of independent cantilever dead load type with no-slip condition and relative sliding condition is proposed to model the nonlinearities of vertical contraction joins, which is special to the nonlinear analysis of arch dams considering the manner of dead load type. Different from the conventional Gauss iterative method, the strategy of the alternating iterative solution of normal force and tangential force is employed. The parallelization based on overlapping domain decomposition method (ODDM) and explicit message passing using distributed memory parallel computers is employed to improve the computational efficiency. An existing high arch dam with fine finite element model is analyzed to investigate the effect of shear sliding of vertical joints on seismic response of the arch dam. The result shows that the values of maximum principal tensile stress under relative sliding condition are significantly greater than those under no-slip condition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Precisely forecasting the disastrous characteristics of landslides can address the optimized preliminary design of the highway landslide stabilization. In this paper, taking the surcharge-induced landslides as an example, we developed the models of the material point method (MPM), a novel meshless numerical method, to calculate the large deformation of the highway landslides, with the affordable computing power. After convincing verification of the MPM model to simulate a surcharge-induced soil landslide, 32 typical postfailure scenarios were analyzed to obtain the highway landslide run-out processes and disastrous characteristics, such as the sliding distance and speed of the leading edge and sliding body morphology. Moreover, linear regression equations of the maximal sliding distance and speed were deduced after verification, to forecast the reasonable avoiding distance. The maximal sliding distance and speed were found to be negatively linearly correlated with the internal frictional angle and cohesion of the soil, and positively linearly correlated with the surcharge and the slope angle, respectively. Optimized preliminary design, of the highways in the mountainous and hilly areas, can be performed based on those insights.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The secondary fracture spacing/aperture has a great influence on flow behavior of multifractured horizontal wells. In this paper, the effects of secondary fracture spacing/aperture distribution on porosity/permeability of the stimulated reservoir volume are described. A new fractal composite flow model was proposed, which can comprehensively characterize the secondary fracture spacing/aperture heterogeneity in the stimulated reservoir volume. Results showed that the larger the fractal dimension of the secondary fracture aperture is, the greater the dimensionless flow rate will be. The smaller the fractal dimension of the secondary fracture spacing is, the smaller the dimensionless flow rate will be. The secondary fracture spacing distribution had a greater influence on flow behavior than the secondary fracture aperture distribution. If the heterogeneity of the secondary fracture spacing or aperture is not considered, the bottomhole pressure and production curve will change greatly. At last, the proposed model was applied to match the production data of two actual fields.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The husks and fruits of Zanthoxylum species (Rutaceae) are the popular pungent and spicy ingredients of foods and the traditional medicines in many countries. Three Zanthoxylum species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium, and Z. piperitum, are distributed and intermixed with each other as “Zanthoxyli Pericarpium” in Korean markets. In the present study, we analyzed the ethyl acetate-soluble and nonpolar fractions of Zanthoxylum samples by 1H NMR spectrometry and performed a multivariate analysis for finding the discriminant markers between three species. Xanthoxylin was identified as the metabolic marker for the discrimination of Zanthoxylum species and quantified by the qNMR approach.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explores demographic, clinical, and therapeutic features of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) in a cohort of 80 patients recruited from 19 Italian referral Centers. Patients’ data were collected retrospectively and then analyzed according to age groups (disease onset before or after 16 years) and genotype (high penetrance (HP) and low penetrance (LP) TNFRSF1A gene variants). Pediatric- and adult-onset were reported, respectively, in 44 and 36 patients; HP and LP variants were found, respectively, in 32 and 44 cases. A positive family history for recurrent fever was reported more frequently in the pediatric group than in the adult group (p&lt;0.05). With reference to clinical features during attacks, pericarditis and myalgia were reported more frequently in the context of adult-onset disease than in the pediatric age (with p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively), while abdominal pain was present in 84% of children and in 25% of adults (p&lt;0.01). Abdominal pain was significantly associated also to the presence of HP mutations (p&lt;0.01), while oral aphthosis was more frequently found in the LP variant group (p&lt;0.05). Systemic amyloidosis occurred in 25% of subjects carrying HP variants. As concerns laboratory features, HP mutations were significantly associated to higher ESR values (p&lt;0.01) and to the persistence of steadily elevated inflammatory markers during asymptomatic periods (p&lt;0.05). The presence of mutations involving a cysteine residue, abdominal pain, and lymphadenopathy during flares significantly correlated with the risk of developing amyloidosis and renal impairment. Conversely, the administration of colchicine negatively correlated to the development of pathologic proteinuria (p&lt;0.05). Both NSAIDs and colchicine were used as monotherapy more frequently in the LP group compared to the HP group (p&lt;0.01). Biologic agents were prescribed to 49 (61%) patients; R92Q subjects were more frequently on NSAIDs monotherapy than other patients (p&lt;0.01); nevertheless, they required biologic therapy in 53.1% of cases. At disease onset, the latest classification criteria for TRAPS were fulfilled by 64/80 (80%) patients (clinical plus genetic items) and 46/80 (57.5%) patients (clinical items only). No statistically significant differences were found in the sensitivity of the classification criteria according to age at onset and according to genotype (p&lt;0.05). This study describes one of the widest cohorts of TRAPS patients in the literature, suggesting that the clinical expression of this syndrome is more influenced by the penetrance of the mutation rather than by the age at onset itself. Given the high phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease, a definite diagnosis should rely on both accurate working clinical assessment and complementary genotype.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Renal disease is a major issue for global public health. Despite some progress in supportive care, the mortality rates among patients with this condition remain alarmingly high. Studies in pursuit of innovative strategies to treat renal diseases, especially stimulating kidney regeneration, have been developed. In this field, stem cell-based therapy has been a promising area. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived renal cells (iPSC-RCs) represent an interesting source of cells for treating kidney diseases. Advances in regenerative medicine using iPSC-RCs and their application to the kidney are discussed in this review. Furthermore, the way differentiation protocols of induced pluripotent stem cells into renal cells may also be applied for the generation of kidney organoids is also described, contributing to studies in renal development, kidney diseases, and drug toxicity tests. The translation of the differentiation methodologies into animal model studies and the safety and feasibility of renal differentiated cells as a treatment for kidney injury are also highlighted. Although only few studies were published in this field, the results seem promising and support the use of iPSC-RCs as a potential therapy in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A 68-year-old male with a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while jogging who was managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is presented. The patient was found to be in refractory ventricular fibrillation by emergency medical service personnel and underwent advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol with placement of an automated chest compression device. He was emergently transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Due to refractory ventricular fibrillation, he was placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Coronary angiography at that time showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Management with VA-ECMO and other supportive measures were continued for 5 days, after which a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed with findings consistent with acute myocarditis. His condition substantially improved, and he was discharged from the hospital with good neurologic and functional status. Fulminant myocarditis is often fatal, but aggressive supportive measures with novel ECPR protocols may result in recovery, as it happened in this case.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Meningioma is a prevalent type of brain tumor. However, the initiation and progression mechanisms involved in the meningioma are mostly unknown. This study aimed at exploring the potential transcription factors/micro(mi)RNAs/genes and biological pathways associated with meningioma. Methods. mRNA expressions from GSE88720, GSE43290, and GSE54934 datasets, containing data from 83 meningioma samples and eight control samples, along with miRNA expression dataset GSE88721, which had 14 meningioma samples and one control sample, were integrated analyzed. The bioinformatics approaches were used for identifying differentially expressed genes and miRNAs, as well as predicting transcription factor targets related to the differentially expressed genes. The approaches were also used for gene ontology term analysis and biological pathway enrichment analysis, construction, and analysis of protein-protein interaction network, and transcription factor-miRNA-gene coregulation network construction. Results. Fifty-six upregulated and 179 downregulated genes were identified. Thirty transcription factors able to target the differentially expressed genes were predicted and selected based on public databases. One hundred seventeen overlapping genes were identified from the differentially expressed genes and the miRNAs predicted by miRWalk. Furthermore, NF-κB/IL6, PTGS2, MYC/hsa-miR-574-5p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p, and hsa-miR-98-5p, which are involved in the transcription factor-miRNA-mRNA coregulation network, were found to be associated with meningioma. Conclusion. The bioinformatics analysis identified several potential molecules and relevant pathways that may represent critical mechanisms involved in the progression and development of meningioma. This work provides new insights into meningioma pathogenesis and treatments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recently, Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) have been introduced as a new information physics system, which enables personnel organizations to control physical entities in a reliable, real-time, secure, and collaborative manner through cyberspace. Moreover, with the maturity of edge computing technology, the data generated by physical entities in CPSS are usually sent to edge computing nodes for effective processing. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to ensure that edge nodes maintain load balance while minimizing the completion time in the event of the edge node outage. Given these problems, a Unique Task Offloading Method (UTOM) for CPSS is designed in this paper. Technically, the system model is constructed firstly and then a multi-objective problem is defined. Afterward, Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) is utilized to generate the feasible solutions of the above problem, whose aims are optimizing the propagation time and achieving load balance. Furthermore, the normalization method has been leveraged to produce standard data and select the global optimal solution. Finally, several necessary experiments of UTOM are introduced in detail.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effect of diamond surface pretreatment and content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of NiAl/Fe–x diamond (x=0,5,10,15,and 20 wt.%) alloys was investigated after mechanical alloying with subsequent hot-pressing sintering. The results showed that after the surface pretreatment, a complete transition layer containing W existed on the outer surface of the diamond grains, which improved the interfacial bonding strength of the diamond grains and NiAl/Fe matrix to an excellent level. As the diamond content increased, the compressive strength of the NiAl/Fe-based alloys declined, but the alloy with 10 wt.% diamond had a higher value than that of the other NiAl/Fe-based alloys. Short cracks and transgranular fracture were observed in the fracture surface of all materials. For the material with 20 wt.% diamond, intergranular fracture was obvious, and many diamond particles appeared along the fracture direction, which caused the compressive strength to be the lowest of the samples considered in this study. After the addition of diamond, the oxidation resistance of NiAl/Fe-based alloys decreased due to a loose oxidation layer and diamond graphitization. The thermal conductivity of the alloy first increased and then decreased with increasing diamond content. A NiAl/Fe-based alloy with 15 wt.% diamond demonstrated the maximum thermal conductivity of 53.2 W/(m·k) at 600°C among the samples in this study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Hypoxia-induced ανβ3 integrin and aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) receptor expression play an important role in tumor neoangiogenesis. APN/CD13-specific 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR), ανβ3 integrin-specific 68Ga-NODAGA-[c(RGD)]2, and hypoxia-specific 68Ga-DOTA-nitroimidazole enable the in vivo detection of the neoangiogenic process and the hypoxic regions in the tumor mass using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR) and 68Ga-DOTA-nitroimidazole allow the in vivo noninvasive detection of the temporal changes of APN/CD13 expression and hypoxia in experimental He/De tumors using positron emission tomography. Materials and Methods. 5×106 hepatocellular carcinoma (He/De) cells were used for the induction of a subcutaneous tumor model in Fischer-344 rats. He/De tumor-bearing animals were anaesthetized, and 90 min after intravenous injection of 10.2±1.1 MBq 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR) or 68Ga-NODAGA-[c(RGD)]2 (as angiogenesis tracers) or 68Ga-DOTA-nitroimidazole (for hypoxia imaging), whole-body PET/MRI scans were performed. Results. Hypoxic regions and angiogenic markers (αvβ3 integrin and APN/CD13) were determined using 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR), 68Ga-DOTA-nitroimidazole, and 68Ga-NODAGA-[c(RGD)]2 in subcutaneously growing He/De tumors in rats. 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR) showed the strong APN/CD13 positivity of He/De tumors in vivo, by which observation was confirmed by western blot analysis. By the qualitative analysis of PET images, heterogenous accumulation was found inside He/De tumors using all radiotracers. Significantly (p≤0.01) higher SUVmean and SUVmax values were found in the radiotracer avid regions of the tumors than those of the nonavid areas using hypoxia and angiogenesis-specific radiopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between the presence of angiogenic markers, the appearance of hypoxic regions, and the tumor volume using noninvasive in vivo PET imaging. Conclusion. 68Ga-DOTA-nitroimidazole and 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR) are suitable diagnostic radiotracers for the detection of the temporal changes of hypoxic areas and neoangiogenic molecule (CD13) expression, which vary during tumor growth in a hepatocellular carcinoma model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. During femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS), there is a significant increase in intraocular pressure, which might lead to ganglion cell damage. We aimed to determine whether there were differences in the changes produced in the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, as evaluated with optical coherence tomography (OCT), between phacoemulsification and FLACS, after implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens (IOL). Methods. Patients with no coexistent pathologies undergoing cataract surgery with implantation of a PanOptix IOL were explored with the Cirrus-OCT before and three months after surgery. GCC values were obtained from the built-in software. The differences between pre- and postoperative GCC and pRNFL thicknesses after phacoemulsification were compared to differences after FLACS. Results. A total of 171 eyes were included, 74 undergoing FLACS and 97 phacoemulsification. For both groups, there was a statistically significant increase in GCC values after cataract surgery, except for the inferior and inferonasal sectors. There were no statistically significant differences between FLACS and phacoemulsification. Mean change in average GCC and minimum GCC were 1.08 ± 1.40 µm (range −1 to +6 µm) and 1.69 ± 2.54 µm (range −3 to +11 µm) after FLACS and 0.99 ± 1.67 µm (range −5 to +6 µm) and 2.02 ± 3.54 µm (−6 to +18 µm) after phacoemulsification. These values are similar to those previously reported after phacoemulsification with monofocal IOL implantation. No significant changes after surgery were detected for the pRNFL, with no differences between groups. Discussion. There were no differences in the changes produced by FLACS and phacoemulsification in either GCC or pRNFL values. Although mean change was small, the range of variation was wide. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a new baseline for GCC and pRNFL thicknesses after cataract surgery in order to monitor any subsequent changes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Frailty contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in patients referred for and undergoing lung transplantation (LTX). The study aim was to determine if frailty is reversible after LTX in those classified as frail at LTX evaluation. Methods. Consecutive LTX recipients were included. All patients underwent modified physical frailty assessment during LTX evaluation. For patients assessed as frail, frailty was reassessed on completion of the post-LTX rehabilitation program. Frailty was defined by the presence of ≥ 3 domains of the modified Fried Frailty Phenotype (mFFP). Results. We performed 166 lung transplants (frail patients, n = 27, 16%). Eighteen of the 27 frail patients have undergone frailty reassessment. Eight frail patients died, and one interstate recipient did not return for reassessment. In the 18 (66%) patients reassessed, there was an overall reduction in their frailty score post-LTX ((3.4 ± 0.6 to 1.0 ± 0.7), p&lt;0.001) with 17/18 (94%) no longer classified as frail. Improvements were seen in the following frailty domains: exhaustion, mobility, appetite, and activity. Handgrip strength did not improve posttransplant. Conclusions. Physical frailty was largely reversible following LTX, underscoring the importance of considering frailty a dynamic, not a fixed, entity. Further work is needed to identify those patients whose frailty is modifiable and establish specific interventions to improve frailty.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Linear secret-sharing scheme (LSSS) is a useful tool for supporting flexible access policy in building attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes. But in lattice-based ABE constructions, there is a subtle security problem in the sense that careless usage of LSSS-based secret sharing over vectors would lead to the leakage of the master secret key. In this paper, we propose a new method that employs LSSS to build lattice-based key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) that resolves this security issue. More specifically, no adversary can reconstruct the master secret key since we introduce a new trapdoor generation algorithm to generate a strong trapdoor (instead of a lattice basis), that is, the master secret key, and remove the dependency of the master secret key on the total number of system attributes. Meanwhile, with the purpose of reducing the storage cost and support dynamic updating on attributes, we extended the traditional 1-dimensional attribute structure to 2-dimensional one. This makes our construction remarkably efficient in space cost, with acceptable time cost. Finally, our scheme is proved to be secure in the standard model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Extracting the tongue body accurately from a digital tongue image is a challenge for automated tongue diagnoses, as the blurred edge of the tongue body, interference of pathological details, and the huge difference in the size and shape of the tongue. In this study, an automated tongue image segmentation method using enhanced fully convolutional network with encoder-decoder structure was presented. In the frame of the proposed network, the deep residual network was adopted as an encoder to obtain dense feature maps, and a Receptive Field Block was assembled behind the encoder. Receptive Field Block can capture adequate global contextual prior because of its structure of the multibranch convolution layers with varying kernels. Moreover, the Feature Pyramid Network was used as a decoder to fuse multiscale feature maps for gathering sufficient positional information to recover the clear contour of the tongue body. The quantitative evaluation of the segmentation results of 300 tongue images from the SIPL-tongue dataset showed that the average Hausdorff Distance, average Symmetric Mean Absolute Surface Distance, average Dice Similarity Coefficient, average precision, average sensitivity, and average specificity were 11.2963, 3.4737, 97.26%, 95.66%, 98.97%, and 98.68%, respectively. The proposed method achieved the best performance compared with the other four deep-learning-based segmentation methods (including SegNet, FCN, PSPNet, and DeepLab v3+). There were also similar results on the HIT-tongue dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve accurate tongue image segmentation and meet the practical requirements of automated tongue diagnoses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Maxillary sinus floor elevation (sinus lift) is a widely recognized dental-surgical approach for dental implant placement. However, for an otorhinolaryngological high-risk patient with severe anatomic-structural impairments of the maxillary sinus drainage pathway, surgical intervention is recommended before sinus lift to avoid postsinus lift maxillary sinusitis. Here, we show a case that postsinus lift maxillary sinusitis in such a high-risk patient was noninvasively prevented by the collaboration of otorhinolaryngologist and dentist. A 48-year-old Japanese male intended to undergo a sinus lift for dental implant placement by periodontist. Otorhinolaryngologist found septal deviation, concha bullosa, the presence of Haller cell, and nasal mucosal swelling by the nasal allergy, while no sinusitis and diagnosed him as a “high-risk case” for postsinus lift maxillary sinusitis. The patient was administered preoperative topical steroid and leukotriene receptor antagonist in addition to perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis so that his complication was noninvasively prevented. Thus, this case suggested that consultation from dentist to otorhinolaryngologist provides benefit to the patients who have been diagnosed as “high-risk case” for postsinus lift maxillary sinusitis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Combination of pest management strategies that minimize pesticide use and conserve natural enemies is important for a sustainable environment. Overreliance on synthetic insecticides in the management of Tuta absoluta has led to pesticide resistance leading to difficulties in managing the pest. In this regard, alternative measures need to be put in place to reduce the effects of this pest. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess the effectiveness of host plant resistance, biological control, and selective insecticides when used in combination, in the management of T. absoluta in tomato production. The study was set up in a greenhouse in a completely randomized design involving two tomato varieties, an insecticide (chlorantraniliprole), and a biological control agent(Macrolophus pygmaeus), applied singly or in combination. Data were collected on T. absoluta damage from the lower, intermediate, and upper leaves. The results from this study show that a combination of insecticide with a moderately resistant variety had a significantly lower T. absoluta damage as compared with a susceptible variety combined with an insecticide. However, the moderately resistant variety when combined with insecticide showed no effect when the biological control agent was added. The susceptible variety significantly reduced T. absoluta damage when combined with the biological control agent. These results indicate that treatment combinations in insect pest management can be utilized. The present study results indicate that using a moderately resistant variety (Riogrande VF) in combination with the insecticide chlorantraniliprole (Coragen®) and a susceptible variety (Pesa F1) in combination with the biological control agent (M. pygmaeus) can improve T. absoluta management. Under good habitat management, the susceptible variety will perform equally as the moderately resistant variety due to suppression of the T. absoluta populations by natural enemies. These findings show the importance of environmental conservation both by enhancing natural enemy abundance and use of selective insecticide in the management of T. absoluta in tomato production. Combinations in this present study are likely to reduce insecticide doses, thereby reducing the cost of production and enhancing environmental compatibility with natural enemies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work focuses on predicting corrosion onset induced by concrete carbonation or chloride ingress when using analytical predictive models. The paper proposes a procedure that helps building and infrastructure managers to select an appropriate model depending on the available information and the means granted to auscultation campaigns. The approach proposed combines the costs of input parameters, their relative importance, the benefits brought through obtaining parameters, and the maintenance strategy of the manager. Costs represent the intellectual investment to obtain parameters. This encompasses the time spent to obtain and analyze a result and the required expertise. Relative importance and benefits are obtained from sensitivity analysis. The effect of the maintenance strategy is introduced through a scalar called efficiency of the model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with two case studies where it is supposed that more or less extended information is available. Three concrete qualities are also considered in the case studies. The results highlight that the available data and concrete type have significant impacts on the selection of the most appropriate model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Advanced glycation end products play an important role in diabetic atherosclerosis. The effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on vascular smooth muscle cell- (VSMC-) derived foam cell formation and phenotypic transformation are unknown. Methods. Serological and histological samples were obtained from diabetic amputation patients and accident amputation patients from the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University. CD68/Actin Alpha 2 (ACTA2) coimmunofluorescence sections were used to quantify the number of VSMCs with macrophage-like phenotypes. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of the receptor of advanced glycation end products in vascular samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the level of serum Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML). In vitro oil red O staining was used to examine lipid accumulation in VSMCs stimulated by CML. The expression of VSMCs and macrophage markers was measured by western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, changes in VSMC migration and secretion were detected by the Transwell assay and ELISA. Results. In the arterial plaque sections of diabetic patients, VSMCs transformed to a macrophage-like phenotype. The serum CML and RAGE levels in the plaques were significantly higher in the diabetes group than those in the healthy control group and were significantly related to the number of macrophage-like VSMCs. CML stimulation promoted intracellular lipid accumulation. However, CML stimulation decreased the expression of VSMC markers and increased the expression of macrophage phenotype markers. Finally, CML promoted smooth muscle cell migration and the secretion of proinflammatory-related factors. Conclusions. CML induces VSMC-derived foam cell formation, and VSMCs transdifferentiate to a macrophage-like state, which may be mediated by the activation of RAGE.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Urinary tract infection is one of the most common health problems worldwide, afflicting many women in reproductive age, especially in developing countries. Increased risk of infection has been attributed to pregnancy and antimicrobial resistance. Objective. To compare the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacteria and associated factors of urinary tract infections among pregnant and nonpregnant women attending public health facilities, Harar, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods. A health facility-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 651 randomly selected women from public health facilities, Harar, Eastern Ethiopia, between February 2017 and December 2017. Pertinent data were collected through a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. The midstream urine specimen was collected and cultured on cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar and blood agar. Pure isolates were tested against the ten most prescribed antimicrobials using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were entered and analysed using Statistical Program for Social Sciences version 21. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. The overall prevalence of significant bacteriuria was 23% (95% CI: 13.6, 26.8). The higher proportion of bacteria were isolated from pregnant women (14.1%) compared to nonpregnant women (8.9%). Escherichia coli (28.8%) and Streptococcus aureus (14.3%) were the most common isolates. E. coli was resistant to amoxicillin (83.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (78.6%), and ciprofloxacin (81%), whereas S. aureus was resistant to chloramphenicol (81%), erythromycin (81%), and amoxicillin (76.2%). Current symptoms, and history of catheterization increase the likelihood of urinary tract infections. Conclusion. Pregnant women were more likely infected with bacterial pathogens than nonpregnant women. Current symptoms, and catheterization increase the odds of urinary tract infections. More than half of the isolates were resistant to the commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Regular assessment of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial resistance are recommended to provide effective therapy and thereby prevent urinary tract complications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Generally, as a precision-guided weapon, the missile has many disadvantage such as high price, difficult maintenance, and low yield. Modern war requires more and more new guided ammunition with high precision, low cost, and low collateral damage. Therefore, as a simple guided conventional ammunition technology, the dual-spin projectile has attracted the attention of ammunition experts recently. This paper proposes a dual-spin projectile scheme based on the rotation control method. Firstly, the concept of the dual-spin projectile is introduced. Secondly, the mathematical model of the dual-spin projectile is established, and the angular motion equation is finally obtained by using some linearized assumptions. Finally, the sufficient and necessary conditions of coning motion stability for dual-spin projectile with angular rate loops are analytically derived and further verified by numerical simulations. It is noticed that the upper bound of the control gain is affected by the delay angle of the control system and the spinning rate of the projectile.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. We aimed to explore the predictive effectiveness of blood biochemical indexes for COVID-19 severity. Method. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of COVID-19 patients who were cured and discharged from the Public Health Treatment Center of Changsha from January 30, 2020, to February 19, 2020. According to the clinical classification of the disease, the patients were divided into severe and nonsevere groups. General clinical data and underlying medical conditions were recorded through the electronic medical record (EMR) system. Laboratory examination results of the patients during their hospitalization were collected, including the first results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte ratio and count, and peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the predictive effectiveness of blood biochemical indexes and other related factors for COVID-19 severity. Result. In all, 108 COVID-19 patients (median age: 43.9 years (range: 1–75); male patients: 56 (51.85%)) were enrolled, of whom 24 (22.22%) showed severe disease and 84 (77.78%) showed nonsevere disease, and two in 24 patients with severe disease developed into a critically severe type and died. Fever was the most common onset symptom (67.59%), followed by cough (48.15%) and fatigue (37.04%). Comorbidities were important factors affecting the severity of COVID-19, and among the patients with severe disease, the proportion with comorbidities was 70.83%, and the proportion without comorbidities was 29.17%. The intergroup difference was significant P&lt;0.05. In patients with CRP levels (mg/L) of ≤8, &gt;8–≤20, &gt;20–≤40, and &gt;40, the proportions of those with severe and nonsevere disease were 0 to 32, 7 to 19, 6 to 23, and 11 to 10, respectively; the intergroup difference was significant P&lt;0.05. Conclusion. The presence or absence of comorbidities and CRP elevation were independent significant predictors of COVID-19 severity, and hypertension was found as the most common comorbidity in patients with severe disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recently, intestinal flora plays a vital role in the occurrence and development of tumors and there is link between cancer immunotherapy and Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk). However, the therapeutic efficacy of Akk in lung cancer remained unclear. Hence, our study is aimed at investigating the antitumor effects of cisplatin (CDDP) combined with Akk on lung cancer. Using the murine lung cancer model by subcutaneously inoculating Lewis lung cancer model, 50 mice were divided into five groups: normal, model, CDDP, CDDP+Akk, and CDDP+antibiotics. After treatment within 5 weeks, compared with the model group, the administered group improved the changes of tumor pathomorphology. Compared with the CDDP group, CDDP combining with Akk slowed down the growth of tumor volume, downregulated the levels of ki-67, p53, and factor-associated suicide (Fas) ligand proteins and upregulated Fas proteins, increased the levels of interferon-γ, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and suppressed the expression of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg in mouse peripheral blood and spleen. In addition, transcriptome analysis indicated that Akk combining with CDDP increased obviously the levels of IFI27l2 and IGFBP7 and was related to those pathways including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Th17 cell differentiation, FOXO, JAK-STAT, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. These results suggested that the therapeutic efficacy of the combined treatment of Akk and CDDP was superior to the only CDDP treatment, which could enhance immune regulation and would be a promising strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Anemia is a widespread public health problem associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Infants, under-5-year-old children, and pregnant women have greater susceptibility to anemia. The magnitude and associated risk factors for anemia vary in different settings. The study aimed to assess the magnitude, severity, and associated factors of anemia at Hawassa University Teaching and Referral hospital, Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. Methods. In a hospital-based cross-sectional study, a total of 422 under-five children were included. Sociodemographic data and other predisposing factors were collected by structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples were collected and analyzed for hemoglobin determination using a Cell-Dyn 1800 automated analyzer. Stool samples were collected and processed using direct wet mount and formol-ether concentration method to detect intestinal parasites. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical packages. Binary and multiple logistic regressions were computed to assess factors associated with anemia. p value less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Result. The overall prevalence of anemia was found to be 41.7%. The mean hemoglobin level was 10.59 g/dl. Anemia was of mild, moderate, and severe type in 6.6%, 19%, and 16.1% of the children, respectively. Children in the age group 6–23 months (AOR = 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.69)), and mothers having no formal education (AOR = 1.73 (95% CI: 0.99, 3.02)) were identified as associated factors for anemia. Conclusion. The prevalence of anemia among the study subjects was 41.7% indicative of the fact that anemia is an important public health problem. It was associated with the child’s age, residence, mother’s education level, and intestinal parasite (Ascaris lumbricoides). It clearly indicates that there should be well integrated public health interventions to improve the health status that needs to be prioritized to prevent anemia among children under five years of age.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Simulations with four land surface models (LSMs) (i.e., Noah, Noah-MP, Noah-MP with ground water GW option, and CLM4) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 12 km horizontal grid resolution were carried out as two sets for 3 months (December–February 2011/2012 and July–September 2012) over West Africa. The objective is to assess the performance of WRF LSMs in simulating meteorological parameters over West Africa. The model precipitation was assessed against TRMM while surface temperature was compared with the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Results show that the LSMs performed differently for different variables in different land-surface conditions. Based on precipitation and temperature, Noah-MP GW is overall the best for all the variables and seasons in combination, while Noah came last. Specifically, Noah-MP GW performed best for JAS temperature and precipitation; CLM4 was the best in simulating DJF precipitation, while Noah was the best in simulating DJF temperature. Noah-MP GW has the wettest Sahel while Noah has the driest one. The strength of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) is strongest in Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP compared with that in CLM4 and Noah. The core of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) lies around 12°N in Noah and 15°N for Noah-MP GW. Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP simulations have stronger influx of moisture advection from the southwesterly monsoonal wind than the CLM4 and Noah with Noah showing the least influx. Also, analysis of the evaporative fraction shows sharp gradient for Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP with wetter Sahel further to the north and further to the south for Noah. Noah-MP-GW has the highest amount of soil moisture, while the CLM4 has the least for both the JAS and DJF seasons. The CLM4 has the highest LH for both DJF and JAS seasons but however has the least SH for both DJF and JAS seasons. The principal difference between the LSMs is in the vegetation representation, description, and parameterization of the soil water column; hence, improvement is recommended in this regard.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to investigate foveal and parafoveal microvascular changes in retinal vascular plexuses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) without clinical diabetic retinopathy (NDR) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in South Korea. We included 64 patients in the NDR group and included 48 healthy control subjects for comparison. All subjects underwent ocular examination with visual acuity and wide-field fundus photos. Foveal and parafoveal vessel density and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (mm2) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were analyzed. Foveal vessel densities in both the SCP and DCP were decreased in the NDR group compared to the controls (p=0.034 and 0.001, respectively). Vessel densities in the superior and inferior parafoveae in the DCP were decreased in the NDR group compared to the controls (p=0.006 and 0.034, respectively). The FAZs of the SCP and DCP were significantly different between the NDR group and the controls (p=0.003 and 0.001, respectively). The average vessel densities of the SCP and DCP were not correlated with HbA1c, serum creatinine, or the duration of DM in the NDR group. We demonstrated that OCTA can identify early-stage DR before the manifestation of clinically apparent retinopathy in diabetic eyes. Diabetic patients without clinical DR have microvascular alterations (foveal vessel density, parts of the parafovea, and enlarged FAZ) in the SCP and DCP. Our results suggest that OCTA might be a promising tool for early detection of eyes with DR.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonol present in many foods. Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer agent despite its dose-limiting cardiovascular toxicity. Herein, we investigated the potential protective effects of quercetin against doxorubicin-induced vascular toxicity and its effect on the therapeutic cytotoxic profile of doxorubicin in breast cancer cell lines. The incubation of isolated aortic rings with doxorubicin produced concentration-dependent exaggeration of vasoconstriction responses to phenylephrine but impaired vasodilation responses to acetylcholine. Coincubation with quercetin completely blocked the exaggerated vasoconstriction responses and the impaired vasodilation. In addition, doxorubicin incubation increased reactive oxygen species generation from the isolated aorta, while coincubation with quercetin inhibited ROS generation back to normal values. On the other hand, quercetin in combination with doxorubicin, doubled the IC50 of doxorubicin alone in MCF-7 cells from 0.4±0.03 to 0.8±0.06 μM. To a lesser extent, the IC50 of doxorubicin did not change after combination with quercetin in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicate a significant antagonistic interaction between quercetin and doxorubicin in the aforementioned cell lines. Only in T47D cells, quercetin combination with doxorubicin was an additive interaction (CI−value=1.17). Yet, quercetin significantly impaired the immediate phase of intracellular ROS generation by doxorubicin within breast cancer cells from 125.2±3.6% to 102.5±3.9% of control cells. Using annexin-V/FITC staining technique, the quercetin/doxorubicin combination showed a significantly lower percent of apoptotic cells compared to doxorubicin alone treated cells. Cell cycle distribution in breast cancer cells was performed using DNA content flowcytometry after propidium iodide staining. Quercetin induced significant accumulation of cells in the S phase as well as in the G2/M phase within both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines and interfered with doxorubicin-induced cell cycle effects. Interestingly, quercetin was found to inhibit the P-glycoprotein ATPase subunit with a consequent enhanced intracellular concentration of doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells. In conclusion, quercetin, despite its potent vascular protective activity against doxorubicin, was found to influence doxorubicin-induced antibreast cancer effects via pharmacodynamic as well as cellular pharmacokinetic aspects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is an integral part of patients' therapeutic experience worldwide. Among Saudi older adults, less is known about CAM utilization. Objectives. To determine the prevalence, patterns, and factors associated with CAM utilization among SOA. Methods. In the Saudi National Survey for Elderly Health (SNSEH), subjects were asked about CAM use during the last twelve months before the interview. CAM use was defined as any use of herbal products, acupuncture, bloodletting, cauterization, medical massage, bones manual manipulation, honey, or religious rituals. Demographic characteristics included gender, age, marital status, region, educational level, and residence area. In addition, multiple comorbidities were included as possible factors that may be associated with CAM use. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with CAM utilization. All statistical analyses were done using STATA v.14. Results. Out of 2946 respondents, 50.4% were males, the mean age was 70.3 ± 8.3 years, and 70% were illiterate. CAM use was prevalent (62.5%). The most common CAM types were herbal products (25.4%), acupuncture (21.2%), bloodletting (12%), honey (9.5%), cauterization (7.4%), medical massage and bones manual manipulation (4%), and traditional bone setting (2.1%). In the multivariable regression, age, gender, and marital status did not have an impact on the odds of using CAM. Subjects from rural areas were 2.92 times more likely to use CAM compared with subjects in urban areas (OR = 2.92; 95%CI: 2.28‐3.75). Subjects with metabolic disorders (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.42‐0.60) or kidney disease were less likely to use CAM (OR = 0.30; 95%CI: 0.14‐0.64). About pain, CAM is used more in neck pain (OR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.30‐2.21) and also used in back pain (OR =  1.22; 95%CI: 1.03‐1.46). Conclusions. CAM use was very prevalent among SOA. Clinicians and pharmacists must ask about CAM use among older adults as many of CAM may interact with patients medications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A systemic design was carried out to investigate the optimal combination of BET, Met-Cr, CLA, and CS for improving the meat tenderness in rats. A total of 104 six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 13 treatments with 4 replicates of 2 rats each. The experiments lasted for 5 weeks. The results showed that inclusion of Met-Cr decreased the contents of intramuscular fat (IMF), fat among muscle cells, and lipid droplets inside muscle cells (P&lt;0.05), and inclusion of CLA or Met-Cr increased the contents of IMF, fat among muscle cells, and lipid droplets inside muscle cells (P&lt;0.05). CS increased the contents of total collagen (TC) and soluble collagen (SC), and CLA decreased the contents of TC and SC (P&lt;0.05). The combination of BET and CLA increased IMF and SC contents and decreased TC contents (P&lt;0.05). The combination of BET and CS could increase fat contents among muscle cells and decrease TC and SC contents (P&lt;0.05). The combination of CLA and Met-Cr decreased IMF contents (P&lt;0.05). The combination of CLA and CS, as well as Met-Cr and CS, decreased fat contents among muscle cells (P&lt;0.05). These combinations may regulate lipogenesis and decrease the deposition of fat in muscles. There existed a significant positive correlation between IMF and SC content, which might indicate that IMF content improves meat’s tenderness partly by increasing SC content in muscle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Esophageal cancer (EC) is a type of extremely aggressive gastrointestinal cancer with high incidences in China and other Asian countries. EC does not have specific symptoms and is relatively easy to metastasize, which makes it difficult in early diagnosis. Thus, novel noninvasive diagnostic method is urgently needed in clinical practice. In this study, mass spectrometry with tandem mass tags and differential protein analysis were applied for identifying esophageal cancer-related proteins. The identified proteins were annotated based on their enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. In addition, hierarchical clustering was applied based on differentially expressed proteins. As a result, a total of 5131 quantifiable proteins were identified from our liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with tandem mass tags (LC-MS/MS-TMT) method with 63 upregulated and 97 downregulated differential proteins between esophageal cancer and controlled normal samples. The differentially expressed proteins were highly enriched in GO terms associated with mitochondrial dissemble and apoptosis, and blood vessel regulation, and the upregulated differentially expressed proteins in EC samples were significantly enriched in major histocompatibility complex MHC-class I/II pathway of immune system. The functional clustering analysis revealed potential protein-protein interactions among tetraspanin, myosin, and S-100. In summary, our study provided a practical technological procedure of proteomic analysis for discovering novel biomarkers of a specific cancer type.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Neonatal sepsis (NS) is a very critical medical situation associated with high morbidities and mortalities. There is an utmost need for a new tool helping in early diagnosis and proper management of sepsis neonates. Neutrophil CD64 (nCD64) shows a very promising value in this concerning issue. Aim. Evaluate the diagnostic, monitoring, and prognostic performances of nCD64 and highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) in NS as well as the possible best panel of biomarkers that can achieve the most desirable results. Methods. Patients were enrolled from three neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (n=121 patients) and classified according to their initial sepsis evaluation into three groups: disease control group (n=30), proven sepsis group (n=17), and clinical sepsis group (n=74). Laboratory evaluation included hs-CRP, complete blood count (CBC), and blood culture in addition to nCD64 (done by flow cytometry technique). Besides the diagnostic evaluations, follow-up evaluations were done for 40 patients after five days from the first time; patients were reclassified according to their outcome into the improved sepsis neonates’ group (n=26) and sepsis neonates without improvement (n=14). Results. Significant increase in nCD64 and hs-CRP results were present in sepsis groups compared to the disease controls (P&lt;0.001); nCD64 at 43% cutoff value could detect the presence of sepsis with 85.6% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Additionally, delta change percentage (dC%) between improved sepsis neonates and sepsis neonates without improvement showed a significant difference in the levels of both nCD64 (P&lt;0.001) and hs-CRP (P=0.001). Conclusion. Besides the promising diagnostic performance documented by nCD64 which is higher than the other laboratory sepsis biomarkers used routinely in NICUs, nCD64 has a valuable role in sepsis patients’ monitoring and prognostic evaluation. hs-CRP was moderate in its diagnostic and monitoring results being less than that achieved by nCD64. Combined measurement of nCD64% and hs-CRP gives better diagnostic and monitoring performance than that achieved by any of them alone.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cognitive radio (CR) technology offers the possibility of an increase in spectrum utilization efficiency to resolve the prevalent spectrum scarcity problem. The economic survival of secondary spectrum markets (SSMs) is heavily dependent on the sharing of both the licensed spectrum and spectrum infrastructure by primary licensed operators (PLOs). In this research, an automated pricing model using a blockchain token called the spectrum dollar has been implemented for secondary radio spectrum trade. The use of spectrum dollars enables noncash-based secondary spectrum trade among PLOs based on a floor-and-trade rule. The pricing of spectrum dollars and the associated revenue shares are based on the underlying secondary spectrum trading behaviours of PLOs. PLOs that do not contribute enough secondary spectra to the SSM (to satisfy demand) suffer a loss proportional to the difference between their earned revenues and the specified floor value in the SSM. The secondary spectrum trade is assumed to be centrally managed by a spectrum broker, which announces the floor value for each bidding period while ensuring nonnegative revenue for the market itself. The use of the spectrum dollar along with the floor-and-trade methodology eliminates the possibilities for economic malpractice by PLOs that could increase spectrum reuse costs. In addition, the floor value provides automatic regulatory control to ensure the economic viability and prevent the technological hijacking of future SSMs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A male bodybuilder of 39 years of age developed severe pruritus, nausea, and jaundice after injecting anabolic steroids purchased on the black market. The patient had no history of liver disease and no risk factors for viral hepatitis. Extensive laboratory testing, radiographic imaging, and liver biopsy excluded a majority of potential pathologies. The patient was diagnosed with drug-induced acute liver injury and secondary acute renal failure most likely caused by testosterone purchased on the black market. The pruritus caused insomnia and significant psychological distress. Treatment was initiated with cholestyramine and naltrexone for one week with no effect on the pruritus. Subsequently, all medications were stopped, and rifampicin was started. Pruritus resolved after starting rifampicin, and liver and kidney function improved rapidly and normalized within 5 months.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Tuan Anh Nguyen</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Quang Tung Nguyen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, fly ash (FA) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were used to make environmentally friendly nanocomposites, which have high fire retardant properties and high mechanical properties. Industrial waste such as fly ash has become a major concern during the treatment of environmental pollution. MWCNTs were used in this experiment to enhance the flame retardant properties and mechanical properties of materials with fly ash additives. MWCNTs content (0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 wt.%) and fly ash content (30, 40, and 50 wt.%) were studied for three different levels. The flame retardancy of the material is significantly improved by the addition of fly ash/MWCNTs at different rates, especially at 0.04 wt. % MWCNTs and 40 wt. % fly ash with LOI at 26.8%. Regarding mechanical properties, tensile strength increases as fly ash/MWCNTs increase, up to a critical point. On the other hand, the compressive strength of composite increases continuously as fly ash/MWCNTs increase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of fly ash and MWCNTs as well as its distribution in the matrix. This will help analyze the influence of the effectiveness of the combination of fly ash and MWCNTs to the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of fly ash/MWCNTs/epoxy nanocomposites.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rapid spread of COVID-19 has demanded a quick response from governments in terms of planning contingency efforts that include the imposition of social isolation measures and an unprecedented increase in the availability of medical services. Both courses of action have been shown to be critical to the success of epidemic control. Under this scenario, the timely adoption of effective strategies allows the outbreak to be decelerated at early stages. The objective of this study is to present an epidemic model specially tailored for the study of the COVID-19 epidemics, and the model is aimed at allowing the integrated study of epidemic control strategies and dimensioning of the required medical infrastructure. Along with the theoretical model, a case study with three prognostic scenarios is presented for the first wave of the epidemic in the city of Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas state, Brazil. Although the temporary collapse of the medical infrastructure is hardly avoidable in the state-of-affairs at this time (April 2020), the results show that there are feasible control strategies that could substantially reduce the overload within reasonable time. Furthermore, this study delivers and presents an intuitive, straightforward, free, and open-source online platform that allows the direct application of the model. The platform can hopefully provide better response time and clarity to the planning of contingency measures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Compared with traditional vehicles delivery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which benefits environmental sustainability. Besides, UAVs can overcome traffic restrictions, which are the big obstacle in parcel delivery. In reality, there are two kinds of most popular traffic restrictions, vehicle-type restriction, and half-side traffic. We propose a mixed-integer (0-1 linear) green routing model with these two kinds of traffic restrictions for UAVs to exploit the environmental aspects of the use of UAVs in logistics. A genetic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the complex routing problem, and an experimental analysis is made to illustrate and validate our model and the algorithm. We found that, under both these two traffic restrictions, UAV delivery can accomplish deliveries that cannot be carried out or are carried out at much higher costs by vehicles only and can always effectively save costs and cut CO2 emissions, which is environmentally friendly. Furthermore, UAV delivery saves more cost and cuts more CO2 emission under the first kind of traffic restriction than that under the second.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Periodontitis is a kind of chronic infectious disease, affecting the health of billions of people. In recent years, a number of studies have shown that multiple immune gene polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility to periodontitis, among which TLR-2 plays a critical role in periodontitis. But most of the studies reported TLR-2 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to periodontitis are not consistent. Therefore, we included all eligible studies in our study for further meta-analysis. Methods. We used electronic databases, including CNKI, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, and relevant research published through June, 2020. Selecting studies involved case-control trials. For all eligibility studies, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are provided or can be calculated from the study data. The size of the combined effect was calculated using STATA 15.0. Results. Our meta-analysis included 14 articles representing 18 case-control studies with a total of 3873 cases and 3438 control subjects. Significant association was found between periodontitis and TLR-2 rs1898830 polymorphism under the allelic model (A allele vs. G allele: p=0.014, OR=1.208, 95% CI: 1.039-1.406), recessive model (GG vs. GA+AA: p=0.028, OR=0.755, 95% CI: 0.588-0.970), and codominant model (GG VS. AA: p=0.014, OR=0.681, 95% CI: 0.501-0.925). In subgroup analysis, TLR-2 rs5743708 polymorphism was associated with periodontitis risk in Asians under an allelic model (G allele vs. A allele: p=0.017, OR=12.064, 95% CI: 1.570-92.688), dominant model (GA+AA vs.GG: p=0.016, OR=0.08, 95% CI: 0.010-0.620), and codominant model (GA VS. GG: p=0.016, OR=1.026, 95% CI: 0.821-1.282). Conclusion. The TLR-2 rs1898830, rs5743708 polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to periodontitis. In the future, genome-wide approaches and large-scale, multiethnic case-control trials are still needed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to L. braziliensis is associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response and tissue damage. Miltefosine is more effective than pentavalent antimony (Sbv) in the treatment of CL, and here, we evaluate the ability of Sbv, miltefosine, and GM-CSF administered intravenously, orally, or topically, respectively, to modify the immune response. Patients were treated with miltefosine plus GM-CSF, miltefosine plus placebo, or Sbv. Mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA) on day 0 and day 15 of therapy, and cytokine levels were determined in supernatants by ELISA. The lymphocyte proliferation and oxidative burst were evaluated by flow cytometry, and the degree of infection and Leishmania killing by optical microscopy. Proliferation of CD4+ T cells were enhanced in patients using miltefosine and in CD8+ T cells when GM-CSF was associated. Enhancement in the oxidative burst occurred in the miltefosine plus GM-CSF group on day 15 of therapy. Moreover, the number of L. braziliensis in infected monocytes on day 15 as well as the percentage of infected cells was lower after 48- and 72-hour culture in cells from patients treated with miltefosine plus GM-CSF. In addition to the ability of miltefosine to kill Leishmania, the changes in the immune response caused by miltefosine and GM-CSF may increase the cure rate of CL patients using these drugs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The delay-time of detonators in hole-by-hole blasting is generally calculated accurately considering they have great influence on the blasting effect, such as blasting vibration and blasting slungshot. The high-precision nonel detonator and digital electronic detonator are been commonly used because of their accuracy of delay-time. However, each detonator has an allowable error range of delay-time due to the difference in manufacturing process. In the initiation network, the errors of delay-time often accumulate gradually as the number of detonators increases. Therefore, theoretical delay-time and actual delay-time with error in the detonating network were discussed based on the delay-time errors of detonators. The single-factor variable method was used to carry out the comparative test in deep hole blasting. The results showed that the particle peak vibration velocity (PPV) was 13.1783 cm/s and 3.4856 cm/s with a drop of 73.55% in comparison with a nonel detonator and digital electronic detonator, which proved that hole-by-hole blasting in the high-precision nonel detonator network was not achieved due to the delay error of detonators. Furthermore, the location distribution map of holes where the same section of detonators might occur was obtained. Finally, the probability of blasting in the same section changes with the number of blast holes was discovered by theoretical analysis, which provided a basis for accurate hole-by-hole blasting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to analyze the stability of water-related materials, the deterioration and damage of rock strength due to circulating water intrusion in an open tailings pond were studied. Uniaxial compression tests were carried out for rocks under different hydrochemical environments and varying numbers of invasion cycles. Results show that, with increasing number of cycle times, rock peak strength and elastic modulus gradually decrease and the acidity and alkalinity of the soaking solution also degrades rock strength. The curve of the number of cycles, acidity, alkalinity, peak strength, and elastic modulus is fit numerically. Based on the principle of damage mechanics, a hydraulic-chemistry-mechanics (HCM) coupling damage variable is defined. Based on the theory of microbody strength distribution, the constitutive equation for rock damage under the coupled effect of water chemistry and cyclic water invasion is established. The results verify the validity of the established damage constitutive model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A 10-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat presented for a suspected tracheal mass. Radiographs confirmed an intraluminal tracheal mass. Tracheal resection and anastomosis of 5 tracheal rings was performed with minimal, mild intraoperative complications and no postoperative complications. Histopathology of the tracheal mass revealed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with incomplete margins both cranially and caudally. Further treatment, including surgical revision, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, was recommended. At the time of publication, no further treatment has been initiated, and a scheduled consultation with the oncologist has been canceled. The cat is doing well at home with no reported signs of recurrence 120 days postoperatively. This is the first report of a cat with a tracheal SCC to be treated with a tracheal resection and anastomosis and only the third feline tracheal SCC to be treated in the veterinary literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Pain management is a very important aspect of nursing care among postoperative patients. Deficit in the knowledge and bad attitude towards pain management among nurses remain a problem in Ghana. In order to manage pain better in the surgical wards, nurses should be well equipped with knowledge of pain assessment and management. Purpose. The purpose of the study was to determine nurse’s knowledge and attitude towards pain management among postoperative patients in surgical units in Ghana. Methodology. This study used the quantitative study approach with a descriptive cross-sectional study design. A sample of 211 nurses was recruited using the convenience sampling method. Data were collected using a questionnaire regarding postoperative pain management. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and the chi-squared test were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 16.0. Results. The mean age of the nurses was 29.77, with the youngest nurse being 23 years and oldest being 39 years. Majority (72.5%) of nurses had moderate knowledge, and 89.6% of the nurses had negative attitude towards pain management. There was no significant relationship between nurse’s knowledge and years of experience as a nurse (r = −0.03, p=0.64), as well as no significant relationship between knowledge and number of years working in the surgical ward (r = 0.06, p=0.36). Also, there was no significant relationship between nurses’ knowledge and nurses’ attitude (r = 0.06, p=0.36). Conclusion and recommendation. The level of knowledge and attitude towards postoperative management were generally inadequate among nurses. Therefore, there is the need to implement in-service training on pain management for nurses working in the surgical units frequently.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An improved method, which combines in situ measured settlement data, hyperbolic method, and deep lateral displacement rate, is presented in this study to predict the consolidation and stability of the ground, which can be used in conducting staged filling construction on soft subsoil. A case history of a highway embankment construction in a tidal flat with thick mucky clay is studied in Xia Pu, China. Preloading with the prefabricated vertical drain method is adopted to accelerate the consolidation of a subgrade. The field behavior of soft ground under filling load is observed through in situ monitoring sensors in four typical sections. The final ground settlement in each stage is determined using the field monitoring data based on the hyperbolic settlement prediction method. For each stage of graded filling load, the ground settlement with a strain consolidation degree of 95% is defined as the standard settlement, and the corresponding settlement time is set as the standard settlement time. The preloading period is estimated according to the standard settlement time. The deep lateral displacement rate of the ground is monitored to control the stability of the foundation and recommended to guide the embankment construction. Results indicate that the presented method can predict the preloading time of graded filling, reduce the frequency of observation, and ensure the consolidation and stability of the ground.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A 40-year-old male was treated using the induced-membrane technique (IMT) for a noninfected, 9 cm long femoral bone defect complicating a lengthening procedure. The interesting case feature lies in the three consecutive IMT procedures that were necessary to achieve complete bone repair in this unusual clinical situation. The first procedure failed because of the lack of graft revascularization likely related to an induced-membrane (IM) alteration demonstrated by histological observations. The second IMT procedure led to partial graft integration interrupted by the elongation nail breakage. At last, the third procedure fully succeeded after nail exchange and iterative iliac bone grafting. Complete bone union was achieved with a poor functional recovery one year after the last procedure and four years following the first cement spacer implantation. By means of clinical and histological observations, we demonstrated that the first and the second IMT failures had two distinct origins, namely, biological and mechanical causes, respectively. Although simple, a successful IMT procedure is not so easy to complete.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pediatric tibial nonunion following corrective osteotomy is a rare complication that is not well understood. While adult nonunions have been linked to endocrine and metabolic aberrations, this has not been established in a pediatric population. Pediatric tibial nonunion has been shown to respond to debridement with revision fixation using dynamic compression plating, supplementary bone graft, and fibular osteotomy to allow compression. Necessity of referral for metabolic and endocrinology workup remains unclear in the pediatric population, though inflammatory markers should be obtained in each case to rule out infection. We present three consecutive cases of pediatric tibial nonunion following osteotomy over a five-year period and discuss the management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accumulating evidence has pointed out that metastasis is the leading cause of death in several malignant tumor, including CRC. During CRC, metastatic capacity is closely correlated with reprogrammed energy metabolism. Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier 1 (MPC1), as the carrier of transporting pyruvate into mitochondria, linked the glycolysis and TCA cycle, which would affect the energy production. However, the specific role of MPC1 on tumor metastasis in CRC remains unexplored. Here, by data mining of genes involved in pyruvate metabolism using the TCGA dataset, we found that MPC1 was significantly downregulated in CRC compared to nontumor tissues. Similar MPC1 expression pattern was also found in multiple GEO datasets. IHC staining in both human sample and AOM/DSS induced mouse CRC model revealed significant downregulation of MPC1. What is more, we found that MPC1 expression was gradually decreased in normal tissue, primary CRC, and metastasis CRC. Additionally, poor prognosis emerged in the MPC1 low expression patients, especially in patients with metastasis. Following, functional tests showed that MPC1 overexpression inhibited the motility of CRC cells in vitro and MPC1 silencing enhanced liver metastases in vivo. Furthermore, we uncovered that decreased MPC1 activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by promoting nuclear translocation of β-catenin to mediate the expression of MMP7, E-cadherin, Snail1, and myc. Collectively, our data suggest that MPC1 has the potential to be served as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and a therapeutic target in CRC.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Agnieszka Madro</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Purpose. In recent years, more and more emphasis has been placed on early diagnosis and adequate treatment of malnutrition in the course of chronic diseases (CP). One of these diseases is chronic pancreatitis in which malnutrition may develop as a consequence of abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and alcohol abuse. The aim of this review paper is recognized if we can improve the nutritional status of patients with CP. Methods. This paper is based on systematic literature review according to the PubMed. Results. One of the most important problems is lack of “gold standard” in screening of nutritional status in patients with CP, especially in outpatient clinics. Another problem is preventing malnutrition in these patients and beginning treatment already at significant stages of disease. To prevent malnutrition you must first recognize the causes of malnutrition in CP, adequately assess its severity using one of available questionnaires and then apply the appropriate therapeutic management. At each visit, remember to assess the nutritional status of the patient, including laboratory markers and anthropometric measurements. Patients should be advised to stop smoking and drinking alcohol and to use adequate enzyme supplementation. Conclusion. Patients with CP should be led by a team of gastroenterologist, diabetologist, and psychologist and consulted by a dietitian, specialist of pain treatment, and surgeon.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The optimization of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane management can better improve the efficiency of road resources. This paper first summarized the current research on HOV lane implementation and analyzed and identifies the threshold of setting road HOV lane dynamic control under the connected vehicle environment. Then, the HOV lane priority dynamic control process was determined, and the operating efficiency and energy consumption evaluation method was proposed. Moreover, a case study in Wuxi City, China, was carried out. The results showed that, after implementing the HOV lane priority dynamic control, the total mileage of road network vehicles was saved by 4.93%, the average travel time per capita was reduced by 4.27%, and the total energy-saving rate of road network travel was 21.96%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A hypernomic reaction or an abnormal inflammatory process could cause a series of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Additionally, oxidative stress has been identified to induce severe tissue injury and inflammation. Carpesium cernuum L. (C. cernuum) is a Chinese folk medicine used for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and detoxifying properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of C. cernuum in inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a methanolic extract of C. cernuum (CLME) on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and a sepsis mouse model. The data presented in this study indicated that CLME inhibited LPS-induced production of proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RAW 264.7 cells. CLME treatment also reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, CLME treatment abolished the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), enhanced the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and reduced the expression of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and ERK kinase (MEK) phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. These outcomes implied that CLME could be a potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper is concerned with the reliable prediction of electricity demands using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The need for electricity demand prediction is fundamental and vital for power resource planning and monitoring. A dataset of electricity demands covering the period of 2003 to 2018 was collected from the Electricity Distribution Company of Ghana, covering three urban areas namely Mallam, Achimota, and Ga East, all in Ghana. The dataset was divided into two parts: one part covering a period of 0 to 500 hours was used for training of the ANFIS algorithm while the second part was used for validation. Three scenarios were considered for the simulation exercise that was done with the MATLAB software. Scenario one considered four inputs sampled data, scenario two considered an additional input making it 5, and scenario 3 was similar to scenario 1 with the exception of the number of membership functions that increased from 2 to 3. The performance of the ANFIS algorithm was assessed by comparing its predictions with other three forecast models namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Findings revealed that the ANFIS algorithm can perform the prediction accurately, the ANFIS algorithm converges faster with an increase in the data used for training, and increasing the membership function resulted in overfitting of data which adversely affected the RMSE values. Comparison of the ANFIS results to other previously used methods of predicting electricity demands including SVR, LS-SVM, and ARIMA revealed that there is merit to the potentials of the ANFIS algorithm for improved predictive accuracy while relying on a quality data for training and reliable setting of tuning parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The construction of a vulnerability model requires reliable information on the features of the buildings in the study. The purpose of this work is the characterisation of the precast industrial buildings in Portuguese industrial park, based on the survey of 73 design projects of existing buildings. The collected data are based on a previous study on the features that influence the seismic response of this type of buildings. The parameters collected are associated with the global geometry and specific elements characteristics (e.g., column dimensions, reinforcement ratios, and connections details), to the mechanical properties of the materials and other parameters that can give some important information in the characterisation of the buildings (e.g., construction year and localization). In the end, a comparison with other available databases, namely, from Italy and Turkey, is done in order to conclude about the similarity. This information is important to define representative experimental specimens and numerical simulation to conduce seismic risk analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zhang Junwei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Based on the bending tests of seven reinforced concrete (RC) short beams strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the bending stiffness curves of the whole process of the short beams strengthened with CFRP were obtained. The variation law of bending stiffness curve of short beam in the whole loading process was analyzed. Based on the reasonable calculation assumption, the calculation method of flexural rigidity of short reinforced concrete beams strengthened with CFRP sheets in the whole loading process was put forward. The comparison between the calculated value and the test value of bending stiffness showed that the calculation method of bending stiffness was reasonable and had high calculation accuracy. This calculation method can be used not only in the calculation of flexural rigidity of short reinforced concrete beams strengthened with CFRP sheets but also in the calculation of flexural rigidity of ordinary short reinforced concrete beams. The calculation method in this paper can provide a theoretical basis for the deformation calculation of reinforced concrete short beams strengthened with CFRP sheets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to study the thermal deformation of the rock that surrounds underground engineering projects with elevated temperatures (e.g., underground coal gasification, coal in situ pyrolysis, in situ oil and gas extraction from oil shale, geothermal energy extraction from rock, among others), a servocontrolled machine (model IMT-HTP 100F) was used to examine the thermal expansion of triaxially stressed mudstone at temperature up to 400°C. Two distinct stages of thermal expansion were found at temperatures up to 400°C: very small thermal expansion below 50°C, followed by almost constant thermal expansion at 50–400°C. This linear thermal expansion coefficient of triaxially stressed mudstone did not increase in the range 50–400°C. The effect of the applied triaxial stress was on both close cracks and impeded grain expansion and the swelling of the rock. Mudstone had a larger linear thermal expansion coefficient than either sandstone or limestone, in that order. The potential energy theory was used to explain the intrinsic variation of thermal expansion of the different rock types.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Capsular stabilization devices were evaluated in a zonular fiber defect model using the slit side view (SSV) system to confirm their utility for capsular stabilization during phacoemulsification. A zonular fiber defect model was made by cutting Zinn’s zonule under observation with a slit lamp microscope in a porcine eye. Phacoemulsification was performed, and the movement of the lens capsule and the depth of the anterior chamber were observed using the SSV in three groups: control group: no surgical instruments used, CE group: a capsule expander was inserted, and CTR group: a capsular tension ring was inserted. In the control group, the equator of the lens was unstable and was easily suctioned to the port of the ultrasound handpiece. The lens capsule was stable in both in the CE and CTR groups. In the CTR group, the equator responsible for the zonular rupture also returned and closed true to its original position. The utility of the capsular stabilization devices in this zonular fiber defect model was confirmed with the SSV system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to monitor the rail base, the dispersion characteristics and propagation properties of the guided wave are studied. Firstly, two modes named as Modes V1 and V2 are selected by the semianalytical finite element method (SAFE). The region at the bottom edge can be monitored by Mode V1, while the junction of the base edge and the flange can be detected by Mode V2. Then, the characteristics in the propagation process are analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). The two modes can be separated about 0.6 ms after they are excited. Thirdly, a wave attenuation algorithm based on mean is proposed to quantify the wave attenuation. Both waves can have weak attenuation and be detected within 5 m. Finally, a mode-identified experiment is performed to validate the aforementioned analysis. And a defect detection experiment is performed to demonstrate the excellent monitoring characteristics using Mode V2. These results can be used to monitor the rail base in practice engineering.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is due to structural changes and narrowing of small airways and parenchymal destruction (loss of the alveolar attachment as a result of pulmonary emphysema), which all lead to airflow limitation. Extracorporeal shock waves (ESW) increase cell proliferation and differentiation of connective tissue fibroblasts. To date no studies are available on ESW treatment of human bronchial fibroblasts and epithelial cells from COPD and control subjects. We obtained primary bronchial fibroblasts from bronchial biopsies of 3 patients with mild/moderate COPD and 3 control smokers with normal lung function. 16HBE cells were also studied. Cells were treated with a piezoelectric shock wave generator at low energy (0.3 mJ/mm2, 500 pulses). After treatment, viability was evaluated and cells were recultured and followed up for 4, 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell growth (WST-1 test) was assessed, and proliferation markers were analyzed by qRT-PCR in cell lysates and by ELISA tests in cell supernatants and cell lysates. After ESW treatment, we observed a significant increase of cell proliferation in all cell types. C-Kit (CD117) mRNA was significantly increased in 16HBE cells at 4 h. Protein levels were significantly increased for c-Kit (CD117) at 4 h in 16HBE (p &lt; 0.0001) and at 24 h in COPD-fibroblasts (p = 0.037); for PCNA at 4 h in 16HBE (p = 0.046); for Thy1 (CD90) at 24 and 72 h in CS-fibroblasts (p = 0.031 and p = 0.041); for TGFβ1 at 72 h in CS-fibroblasts (p = 0.038); for procollagen-1 at 4 h in COPD-fibroblasts (p = 0.020); and for NF-κB-p65 at 4 and 24 h in 16HBE (p = 0.015 and p = 0.0002). In the peripheral lung tissue of a representative COPD patient, alveolar type II epithelial cells (TTF‐1+) coexpressing c-Kit (CD117) and PCNA were occasionally observed. These data show an increase of cell proliferation induced by a low dosage of extracorporeal shock waves in 16HBE cells and primary bronchial fibroblasts of COPD and control smoking subjects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the past few decades, identification recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) has received extensive attention to resolve the security problems of conventional biometric systems. In the present study, a novel EEG-based identification system with different entropy and a continuous convolution neural network (CNN) classifier is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is experimentally evaluated through the emotional EEG data. The conducted experiment shows that the proposed method approaches the stunning accuracy (ACC) of 99.7% on average and can rapidly train and update the DE-CNN model. Then, the effects of different emotions and the impact of different time intervals on the identification performance are investigated. Obtained results show that different emotions affect the identification accuracy, where the negative and neutral mood EEG has a better robustness than positive emotions. For a video signal as the EEG stimulant, it is found that the proposed method with 0–75 Hz is more robust than a single band, while the 15–32 Hz band presents overfitting and reduces the accuracy of the cross-emotion test. It is concluded that time interval reduces the accuracy and the 15–32 Hz band has the best compatibility in terms of the attenuation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases that affects millions of people worldwide, mainly the aging population. Despite numerous published reports, little is known about the pathology of this disease, and no feasible treatment plan exists to stop OA progression. Recently, extensive basic and clinical studies have shown that adipokines play a key role in OA development. Moreover, some drugs associated with adipokines have shown chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on OA. Visfatin has been shown to play a detrimental role in the progression of OA. It increases the production of matrix metalloproteinases and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS), induces the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, affects the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes, and induces osteophyte formation by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Although some side effects of chemical visfatin inhibitors have been reported, they were shown to be successful in the treatment of diabetes, cancer, and other diseases that can utilize Chinese herbs, further suggesting that similar therapeutic strategies could be used in OA prevention and treatment. Here, we describe the pathophysiological mechanism of visfatin in OA and discuss some potential pharmacological interventions using Chinese herbs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Preterm birth implies an array of respiratory diseases including apnea of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Caffeine has been introduced to treat apneas but also appears to reduce rates of BPD. Oxygen is essential when treating preterm infants with respiratory problems but high oxygen exposure aggravates BPD. This experimental study is aimed at investigating the action of caffeine on inflammatory response and cell death in pulmonary tissue in a hyperoxia-based model of BPD in the newborn rat. Material/Methods. Lung injury was induced by hyperoxic exposure with 80% oxygen for three (P3) or five (P5) postnatal days with or without recovery in ambient air until postnatal day 15 (P15). Newborn Wistar rats were treated with PBS or caffeine (10 mg/kg) every two days beginning at the day of birth. The effects of caffeine on hyperoxic-induced pulmonary inflammatory response were examined at P3 and P5 immediately after oxygen exposure or after recovery in ambient air (P15) by immunohistological staining and analysis of lung homogenates by ELISA and qPCR. Results. Treatment with caffeine significantly attenuated changes in hyperoxia-induced cell death and apoptosis-associated factors. There was a significant decrease in proinflammatory mediators and redox-sensitive transcription factor NFκB in the hyperoxia-exposed lung tissue of the caffeine-treated group compared to the nontreated group. Moreover, treatment with caffeine under hyperoxia modulated the transcription of the adenosine receptor (Adora)1. Caffeine induced pulmonary chemokine and cytokine transcription followed by immune cell infiltration of alveolar macrophages as well as increased adenosine receptor (Adora1, 2a, and 2b) expression. Conclusions. The present study investigating the impact of caffeine on the inflammatory response, pulmonary cell degeneration and modulation of adenosine receptor expression, provides further evidence that caffeine acts as an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory drug for experimental oxygen-mediated lung injury. Experimental studies may broaden the understanding of therapeutic use of caffeine in modulating detrimental mechanisms involved in BPD development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The field of stochastic processes is essentially a branch of probability theory, treating probabilistic models that evolve in time. It is best viewed as a branch of mathematics, starting with the axioms of probability and containing a rich and fascinating set of results following from those axioms. In probability theory, a convex function applied to the expected value of a random variable is always bounded above by the expected value of the convex function of the random variable. In this paper, the concept of generalized h-convex stochastic processes is introduced, and some basic properties concerning generalized h-convex stochastic processes are developed. Furthermore, we establish Jensen and Hermite–Hadamard and Fejér-type inequalities for this generalization.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yu Dong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nanomechanical properties and interphase dimensions of PVA bionanocomposites reinforced with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and Cloisite 30B montmorillonite (MMT) were evaluated by means of peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PFQNM). A three-phase theoretical composite model was established based on hard-core–soft-shell structures consisting of hard mono-/polydispersed anisotropic particles and soft interphase and matrices. Halpin-Tsai model and Mori-Tanaka model were employed to predict experimentally determined tensile moduli of PVA bionanocomposites where effective volume fraction of randomly oriented nanoparticles resulted from the inclusion of interphase properties and volume fractions. Overall, it was suggested that the estimation of elastic modulus according to effective volume fraction of nanoparticles revealed better agreement with experimental data as opposed to that based upon their nominal volume fraction. In particular, the use of polydispersed HNTs and Cloisite 30B MMT clays with Fuller particulate gradation was proven to yield the best prediction when compared with experimental data among all proposed theoretical models. This study overcomes the neglected real interphase characteristics in modelling nanocomposite materials with much more accurate estimation of their mechanical properties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe visual loss and irreversible blindness in the elderly population worldwide. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are the major site of pathological alterations in AMD. They are responsible for the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POSs) and clearance of cellular waste under physiological conditions. Age-related, cumulative oxidative stimuli contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. Excessive oxidative stress induces RPE cell degeneration and incomplete digestion of POSs, leading to the continuous accumulation of cellular waste (such as lipofuscin). Autophagy is a major system of degradation of damaged or unnecessary proteins. However, degenerative RPE cells in AMD patients cannot perform autophagy sufficiently to resist oxidative damage. Increasing evidence supports the idea that enhancing the autophagic process can properly alleviate oxidative injury in AMD and protect RPE and photoreceptor cells from degeneration and death, although overactivated autophagy may lead to cell death at early stages of retinal degenerative diseases. The crosstalk among the NFE2L2, PGC-1, p62, AMPK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways may play a crucial role in improving disturbed autophagy and mitigating the progression of AMD. In this review, we discuss how autophagy prevents oxidative damage in AMD, summarize potential neuroprotective strategies for therapeutic interventions, and provide an overview of these neuroprotective mechanisms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a mathematical model for describing the solid-fluid transformation of ice water is put forward based on the special geometry cases. The correctness of the obtained model is verified through comparison with numerical analysis and experiments. The good agreement indicates that the obtained model is available for the study of the solid-fluid transformation of ice water. The theory derived in this paper lays a foundation for the research of solid-fluid transformation phenomena of other materials and may have important applications in engineering areas such as rheology, creep, and instability of materials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In view of the problem of “jumping points” in the phase unwrapping of the multifrequency heterodyne principle, this paper proposes a novel method to improve the multifrequency heterodyne. By solving the root-mean-square error of the original frequency function, it includes the relationship between the error and the adjacent phase in the condition of constrained phase unwrapping, and it compensates phase ±2π of the skip point. To ensure the accuracy of phase unwrapping, the function with a “jump point” after each phase unwrapping and the absolute phase curve of the principal value function are used to establish the threshold judgment model of the least square method, and the initial phase unwrapping of the principal value function with different frequencies is carried out continuously. The simulation analysis of phase compensation with the four-step phase-shifting method shows that the error is reduced to 36% under the set environment. The experimental result of 3D reconstruction by measuring the flatness of the plate shows that the error decreases by 41% after phase compensation compared with before phase compensation. The three-dimensional reconstruction experiment of pitch measurement with a nut shows that the nut after phase compensation is smooth without noise, and the pitch error is 0.033 mm, which verified the method is workable and effective.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To systematically evaluate the effects of red yeast rice (RYR) and its extract on bone formation in experimental animals and to provide reference data for clinical research on the treatment of osteoporosis. Methods. Chinese and English language databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Elsevier, Google Scholar, SpringerLink, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu Chinese Sci-tech periodical full-text database (VIP), and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), were searched from their establishment to February 2020 using the following terms: “hongqu,” “red yeast rice,” “Monascus purpureus-fermented rice,” “bone mineral density,” “osteoblast,” “osteoporosis,” and “animal models.” After excluding nonrelevant articles, Review Manager 5.2 was used to evaluate article quality and to analyze the data. Outcome indicators included bone mineral density (BMD), osteoblast proliferation, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Results. A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis, all of which were animal studies. Six studies included data on BMD, five on osteoblast proliferation, and six on the expression of ALP. The results of the meta-analysis showed that RYR can significantly improve BMD (standardized mean difference SMD=3.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 4.83, P=0.0003), promote osteoblast proliferation (SMD=1.64, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.23, P&lt;0.00001), and increase ALP expression in rats (SMD=1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.80, P&lt;0.00001). Conclusions. RYR can promote bone formation in experimental animals and may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we propose a stage-structured predator-prey model with migrations among patches in an n-patch environment. The net reproduction number for each patch in isolation is obtained along with the net reproduction number of the system of patches, ℛ0. Inequalities describing the relationship among these numbers are also given. Furthermore, threshold dynamics determined by ℛ0 is established: the predator dies out if ℛ0&lt;1 while the predator persists if ℛ0&gt;1. Focusing on the case with two patches, we obtain that the dispersal decreases the net reproduction number ℛ0. By numerical simulations, we find that the dispersal may be a good thing or a bad thing because the dispersal could make the predator population thrive or extinct, and hence we might seek steady state in the ecological environment by controlling parameters related to the prey and the predator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The present study investigated the relationship between dry eye and the disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Patients with RA were divided by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) into the symptomatic group (score ≥ 12) and the asymptomatic group (score &lt; 12). By using the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) questionnaire, they were divided into the active group (score &gt; 2.6) and the stable group (score ≤ 2.6). In the control group, 20 healthy adults with matched sex and age were selected. RA patients and healthy adults were inspected for the tear film break time (TBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), meibomian scan (MS), meibomian gland secretion score (MSS), and eyelid margin assessment (EMS). Results. The TBUT of the RA group was significantly less than that of the control group, while the CFS, MS, EMS, and MSS were higher. The TBUT of the symptomatic RA group was significantly less than that of the asymptomatic group, and the CFS was higher. In the active RA group, only the CFS was higher than that of the stable group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups for other parameters. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the course of RA and the dry eye (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion. The rheumatoid activity does not necessarily lead to an aggravation of dry eye. Regardless of the duration, RA was not found to exhibit relation with the severity of dry eye. Translational Relevance. RA patients with disease active period cannot be ignored for the existence of dry eye, since patients with dry eye often lack the signs and symptoms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A method based on the wavelet transform and improved particle swarm optimization (WIPSO) algorithm is proposed to identify the microdamage of structures. First, the singularity of wavelet coefficients is used to identify the structural damage location, and then, the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is used to calculate the optimal solution of the objective function of the structural damage location to determine the structural damage severity. To study the performance of WIPSO, the structural microdamage severity is set within 10%, and a numerical simulation and experimental structure under different damage scenarios are considered. In addition, the ability of wavelet coefficients to identify the location of the structural damage under different noise levels is studied. To evaluate the performance of IPSO, the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm with an inertia weight factor of 0.8 (0.8PSO), the genetic algorithm (GA), and the bat algorithm (BA) are also considered. The results show that WIPSO can effectively and accurately identify the structural damage location and severity. Wavelet transform is very robust to the structural damage location. Compared with the standard 0.8PSO and other mainstream algorithms, IPSO has good convergence and performs more stable and more accurate in the identification of structural damage severity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is the major cause of intestinal damage in clinic. Although either mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or interleukin 37 (IL-37) shows some beneficial roles to ameliorate IRI, their effects are limited. In this study, the preventative effects of IL-37 gene-modified MSCs (IL-37-MSCs) on intestinal IRI are investigated. Methods. Intestinal IRI model was established by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 30 minutes and then reperfused for 72 hours in rats. Forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the sham control, IL-37-MSC-treated, MSC-treated, recombinant IL-37- (rIL-37-) treated, and untreated groups. Intestinal damage was assessed by H&amp;E staining. The levels of gut barrier function factors (diamine oxidase and D-Lactate) and inflammation cytokine IL-1β were assayed using ELISA. The synthesis of tissue damage-related NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream cascade reactions including cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 was detected by western blot. The mRNA levels of proinflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-α, which are downstream of IL-1β and IL-18, were determined by qPCR. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) after the normality test and followed by post hoc analysis with the least significant difference (LSD) test. Results. IL-37-MSCs were able to migrate to the damaged tissue and significantly inhibit intestinal IRI. As compared with MSCs or the rIL-37 monotherapy group, IL-37-MSC treatment both improved gut barrier function and decreased local and systemic inflammation cytokine IL-1β level in IRI rats. In addition, tissue damage-related NLRP3 and downstream targets (cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18) were significantly decreased in IRI rats treated with IL-37-MSCs. Furthermore, IL-1β- and IL-18-related proinflammatory mediator IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expressions were all significantly decreased in IRI rats treated with IL-37-MSCs. Conclusion. The results suggest that IL-37 gene modification significantly enhances the protective effects of MSCs against intestinal IRI. In addition, NLRP3-related signaling pathways could be associated with IL-37-MSC-mediated protection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In addition to the vibration loads caused by offshore structure construction, the offshore foundation pit can also be affected by additional hydraulic loads such as waves, tides, and typhoons, hindering our understanding of the mechanical performance of the foundation pit supporting structure. In order to illuminate this mechanical performance under waves, tides, hammering, and unbalanced loads, this paper analyzed the supporting structure with theoretical and numerical simulations. The results were verified with field monitoring data. Moreover, the influences of loads, including construction vibration loads and unbalanced loads, on structure and soil were discussed. By applying these results to the engineering design, this research could provide a reference for studying mechanical properties of relevant supporting structures and the construction of offshore foundation pits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Globally, anemia affects one-fourth of the world population including 30% of nonpregnant reproductive-aged women. It has a number of causes including micronutrient deficiencies and chronic infections, inherited or acquired disorders of hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cell production, or survival alterations. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anemia among reproductive-aged women in Sayint Adjibar town, South Wollo Zone, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April among 359 reproductive-aged women (RAW). Systematic random sampling technique was implemented to select study participants. Sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive histories of study participants were collected using the structured and pretested questionnaire. Capillary blood and stool samples were collected from each study participant for hemoglobin and parasitological analysis, respectively. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of anemia. p value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result. The median age of the study participants was 25 years. The overall prevalence of anemia was 24.2%. Among those anemic individuals, 49 (56.3%) were mildly anemic. Age category 36–49 years (AOR = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 6.60), no formal educational status (AOR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.92), food insecurity (AOR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.01–3.65), and body mass index of above 25 kg/m2 (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08–0.87) were found to be statistically significant with anemia. Conclusion. The prevalence of anemia in this study was found as a moderate public health problem. The prevalence was significantly associated with women who had no formal education and were of older age group and those women living with household food insecurity and with higher body mass index. Therefore, it is better to design appropriate interventional strategies to reduce reproductive-aged women anemia. These include information, education, and communication activities focused on reproductive-aged women with no formal education and life-cycle-focused food security rather than targeted to only infants and young children or pregnant women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Euglycemic ketoacidosis is a recognised side effect secondary to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, there is scarce evidence to suggest whether preexisting comorbid conditions contribute to the development of this potentially life-threatening complication. We describe a case of euglycemic ketoacidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the context of empagliflozin use after a recent diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis was complicated by a pulmonary embolism and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and was subsequently established after an anion-gap metabolic acidosis was identified on arterial blood gas and serum ketone measurement. The patient required admission to the intensive care unit for fluid resuscitation and regular intravenous insulin to ensure resolution of acidosis and maintenance of normoglycaemia. The patient was discharged to home for outpatient single-agent pembrolizumab for treatment of his lung adenocarcinoma. This article highlights the importance or awareness of oral hypoglycaemic medications and their side effects, along with providing further evidence for the potential contribution of malignancy to the development of euglycemic ketoacidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the authors introduced energy entropy as a reference feature into the field of blast vibration recognition classification and achieved good results. On the basis of the previous experimental database, 4 kinds of typical vibration signals were selected to form the sample group (building collapse vibration, surface rock blast vibration, underground tunnel blast vibration, and natural gas pipeline explosion vibration). EEMD (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) algorithm was used to calculate the energy entropy of each signal. Taking eigenvector composed of CEE (components of energy entropy) as input, multiclassification SVM algorithm was used for training and prediction. Prediction accuracy was more than 80%. Compared with BP (backpropagation) neural network algorithm, SVM (support vector machine) algorithm has higher training efficiency. The research results can be used in urban vibration monitoring, identify the nature of vibration source in time, and provide technical support for rapid response of emergency rescue.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ritodrine hydrochloride is used for preterm labor, although serious side effects, including agranulocytosis, are reported. We report a case of ritodrine hydrochloride-induced agranulocytosis accompanied by bacteremia due to catheter infection. At 24 weeks of gestation, a female patient presented due to threatened premature labor and was administered continuous intravenous infusion of ritodrine hydrochloride. On day 36 after starting intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride, she was diagnosed with agranulocytosis. The white blood cell and granulocyte count nadirs were 1,660/μl and 438/μl. The cumulative dose of ritodrine hydrochloride was 2,610 mg. Ritodrine therapy was immediately stopped, and she was given an intravenous injection of antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. From her blood culture, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was detected. However, she started vaginal delivery two days after we stopped the ritodrine infusion. When using ritodrine hydrochloride, it is necessary to frequently check the white blood cell count, regardless of the total dose and treatment period.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Not much is yet known about this new viral disease. In our early encounter with the COVID-19, before the pandemic and during the early days of dealing with this novel viral disease in our country, we saw some cases of anosmia in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In many cases, this chemosensitive dysfunction persisted after the negativization of the nasopharyngeal swab. We report effective treatment of anosmia by oral corticosteroid therapy in a patient recovered from COVID-19.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Based on the principle of the critical flow and standard k-ε three-dimensional turbulence model, experiments and simulations were performed on a portable pillar-shaped flume with three contraction ratios under 12 working conditions. By combining the numerical simulations with the experiments, the theoretical stage-discharge formula of the portable pillar-shaped flume was developed, and the variations in the Froude number, backwater height, critical submergence, head loss, and velocity distribution were examined. The simulation data obtained from the standard k-ε three-dimensional turbulence model are in good agreement with the experimental results, with a maximum error of 8.65%. The maximum error in the difference between the theoretical stage-discharge formula and the measured value is 4.74%. The upstream Froude number is less than 0.5, and critical submergence is between 0.73 and 0.96. Compared to airfoil pillar-shaped flumes, the portable pillar-shaped flume had a significantly smaller head loss and backwater height. Finally, the portable pillar-shaped flume can be used for flow measurement and has the advantages of high measurement accuracy, low backwater height, and small head loss.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The importance of facility management (FM) has gradually been recognized in the life cycle of a building. Both new and existing buildings require a more efficient approach and advanced technology to improve the efficiency of the FM. The study is aimed to enhance the facility repair process. Thus, the study presents a building information modeling (BIM)-based facility repair platform framework, which enables expedited reporting for repairs and a comprehensive listing of the status, location, and maintenance record facilities. To effectively facilitate the FM information transfer among stakeholders, firstly, the study presents a facility traceability coding structure for building facilities, the proposed platform framework. The proposed facility traceability information coding in QR code format can help general users and FM personnel identify and locate the specific or abnormal facility quickly. Secondly, the study demonstrates that how to apply the proposed code in QR code format in the BIM-based facility repair platform with a case test. The research findings showed that the proposed method enables FM personnel to significantly improve the efficiency of FM, which can help FM personnel make preliminary facility repair judgments and schedule maintenance plan to track the status of the facility repair which can help improve the efficiency of facility management and simplify the repair process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Some adult patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) were found to simultaneously develop ascending aortic dilation. Severe aortic dilation would lead to several aortic diseases, including aortic aneurysm and dissection, which seriously affect patients’ living quality and even cause patients’ death. Current practice guidelines of aortic-dilation-related diseases mainly focus on aortic diameter, which has been found not always a good indicator. Therefore, it may be clinically useful to identify some other factors that can potentially better predict aortic response to dilation. Methods. 20 TOF patients scheduled for TOF repair surgery were recruited in this study and were divided into dilated and nondilated groups according to the Z scores of ascending aorta diameters. Patient-specific aortic CT images, pressure, and flow rates were used in the construction of computational biomechanical models. Results. Simulation results demonstrated a good coincidence between numerical mean flow rate at inlet and the one obtained from color Doppler ultrasonography, which implied that computational models were able to simulate the movement of the aorta and blood inside accurately. Our results indicated that aortic stress can effectively differentiate patients of the dilated group from the ones of the nondilated group. Mean ascending aortic stress-P1 (maximal principal stress) from the dilated group was 54% higher than that from the nondilated group (97.97 kPa vs. 63.47 kPa, p value = 0.044) under systolic pressure. Velocity magnitude in the aorta and aortic wall displacement of the dilated group were also greater than those of the nondilated group with p value &lt; 0.1. Conclusion. Computational modeling and ascending aortic biomechanical factors may be used as a potential tool to identify and analyze aortic response to dilation. Large-scale clinical studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Vibrations due to mechanical excitation and internal and external fluid flow can cause fatigue in pipelines and leaks in fittings. A beam-based dynamic vibration absorber (beam DVA) is a device comprising an L-shaped beam with a concentrated mass at its free end that can be used to absorb and dissipate vibrations in the pipeline. In this paper, a mathematical equation is extracted to design the beam DVA using the dimensional analysis (DA) method and data recorded from 120 experimental tests. In the experimental studies, the pipes are fabricated in 1-inch, 2-inch, and 3-inch sizes. Each pipe is subjected to harmonic excitation at different frequencies, and the amplitude of vibration of the pipe is evaluated by changes in the geometric characteristics of beam DVA and concentrated mass. The proposed methodology is validated using the finite element method and simulation in the SIMULINK/MATLAB. The results showed that, out of the nine effective dimensionless parameters identified in pipe vibration control, mass ratio and stiffness ratio have the highest and lowest impacts on pipe vibration absorption, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigated the characteristics of metal(loid) transport and dispersion in agricultural soils near an abandoned metal mine. Topsoil samples were collected from 162 sampling sites in the study area, including 1 in the mine tailing dumps, to analyze the total concentrations of As, Pb, Cd, and Zn. Subsequently, the metal(loid) transport and dispersion characteristics were investigated using geographic information system (GIS) technology. The results of this study clearly demonstrated the variation in the dispersal of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn from the mine tailing dumps to nearby agricultural soils and the element-specific spatial variability in their respective transport and dispersion characteristics. These findings suggested that compared with the migration behavior of Cd, Pb, and Zn, that of As has a farther-reaching impact on agricultural soils owing to its geochemical cycling in the soil and groundwater environment. This impact differed significantly in magnitude from that of the other investigated metals. Therefore, special consideration must be given to the migration behavior of As.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Trastuzumab has been introduced a decade ago and demonstrated improvement in the prognosis in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- (HER2-) positive (+) breast carcinoma (BC). This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide with weekly paclitaxel-trastuzumab as neoadjuvant chemotherapies in HER2+ BC patients. Methods. A total of 234 HER2+ BC patients were given neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) between 2010 and 2016. The primary endpoints were pathologic complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical and pathological factors associated with pCR and DFS were conducted. Results. The pCR (30.4% vs. 14.8%; P=0.004) and DFS (P=0.036) showed significant differences between patients administered with neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy and those who did not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment was regarded as an independent predictor of pCR. Patients with pCR had prolonged DFS (P=0.025). In patients who did not achieve pCR (non-pCR), those who received trastuzumab had more prolonged DFS (P=0.046). The luminal B/HER2+ subtypes had prolonged DFS when compared with nonluminal B/HER2+ subtypes (P=0.010). The luminal B/HER2+ subgroup also showed improved DFS in non-pCR patients (P=0.010). In the subgroup of non-pCR, the luminal B/HER2+ subgroup administered with trastuzumab showed no superior DFS (P=0.168). However, a positive result was observed in patients without trastuzumab (P=0.039). Multivariate analysis showed cT stage (P=0.006) and tumor grade (P=0.041), considering them as significant prognostic factors of DFS. Conclusions. HER2+ BC patients showed improvement in pCR and DFS after neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment. Patients without pCR had prolonged DFS after trastuzumab maintenance. Although the prognosis of luminal B/HER2+ BC showed favorable outcomes in the non-pCR subgroup, those receiving trastuzumab showed no survival advantage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by progressive pancreatic β-cells failure and progressive autoimmunity. It is difficult to diagnose T1DM and to prevent the pancreatic β-cells destruction because of the undetectable pancreatic β-cell necrosis and abnormal autoimmunity. Here, we built streptozotocin-induced T1DM mouse model and performed MSC injection at the early stage of T1DM. We found that MSC infusion displayed enhanced effects on reducing the pathological damage and improving the survival quality. Moreover, the delivery of MSCs inhibited Th1 cell polarization and downregulated the Th1 subset ratio. The immunomodulatory mechanism of MSC was further investigated. Real-time PCR and ELISA assays demonstrated that IFN-γ expression at both mRNA and protein level in MSC infusion T1DM mice was downregulated, partially regulated by MSC-exosome-derived miR-148a-3p. Taken together, this early therapeutic strategy may improve the clinical efficacy of MSC-based therapy in T1DM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Symptomatic hypercalcemia is a commonly encountered clinical scenario. Though it is important to collect detailed history to find clinical clues connecting to the etiology of hypercalcemia, the diagnostic workup of hypercalcemia depends heavily on laboratory analysis. Accurate measurement of the parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels is essential. However, commercial laboratory measurement of vitamin D levels can be erroneous in the setting of abundant paraprotein in the serum. One of the most common conditions that can cause an increased amount of paraproteins is multiple myeloma. We report 2 cases of falsely elevated 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in patients presenting with hypercalcemia and an underlying diagnosis of MM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper develops two novel and fast Riemannian second-order approaches for solving a class of matrix trace minimization problems with orthogonality constraints, which is widely applied in multivariate statistical analysis. The existing majorization method is guaranteed to converge but its convergence rate is at best linear. A hybrid Riemannian Newton-type algorithm with both global and quadratic convergence is proposed firstly. A Riemannian trust-region method based on the proposed Newton method is further provided. Some numerical tests and application to the least squares fitting of the DEDICOM model and the orthonormal INDSCAL model are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Comparisons with some latest Riemannian gradient-type methods and some existing Riemannian second-order algorithms in the MATLAB toolbox Manopt are also presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aiming at the problem of how to store/release gait energy with high efficiency for the conventional unpowered lower extremity exoskeletons, an unpowered lower-limb exoskeleton is proposed. In the current study, the human motion model is established, and the change rule and recovery/utilization mechanism of gait energy are illustrated. The stiffness and metabolic cost of relevant muscles in lower extremity joints are obtained based on OpenSim software. The results show that stiffness of muscle is increased when muscle concentric contraction generates positive work, but it is reverse when muscle eccentric contraction generates negative work. Besides, metabolic cost of the soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior decreased about 31.5%, 34.7%, and 40%, respectively. Metabolic cost of the rectus femoris, tensor fascia lata, and sartorius decreased about 36.3%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, and the total metabolic cost of body decreased about 15.5%, under the exoskeleton conditions. The results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for the optimal design of unpowered lower extremity exoskeleton.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was carried out to examine the removal of rare earth (RE) elements by electrodeposition for the purification and reuse of LiCl-KCl salt after electrorefining and electrowinning. The electrochemical behavior of RE elements (Dy and Gd) in LiCl-KCl-DyCl3-GdCl3 at 500°C was investigated using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique using Mo and Mg electrodes. It was observed that the reduction potential of the RE elements shifted at the Mg electrode owing to the alloy formation with Mg (RE-Mg alloy). Subsequently, a series of potentiostatic electrolysis tests were conducted to remove the RE elements in the salt and check the formation of deposits at the Mg and Mo electrodes. The scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) technique was used to confirm that the reduced RE metals were deposited on the surface of the Mg electrode. However, no significant deposit on the Mo electrode was observed, and a mud-like deposit was found on the bottom of the electrochemical cell. The salt analysis performed by employing the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) indicated that the removal efficiency of Dy3+ and Gd3+ through electrodeposition was 83.5∼95.2 and 91.6∼95.2%, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A young woman with mixed connective tissue disease complicated by erosive arthritis, secondary hypogammaglobulinemia due to rituximab, and a history of many infectious complications developed multiple nonhealing wounds, polyarticular joint pain, and leukocytosis. Radiographic studies demonstrated multiple scattered areas of osteomyelitis and complex abscesses. Purulent fluid drained from multiple sites did not yield a microbiologic diagnosis by standard culture technique, but Mycoplasma orale was ultimately identified using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplification and sequencing. We describe this unique case and review the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Most of the malaria-related complications in children are due to delay in the treatment-seeking of caregivers. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of delay in seeking malaria treatment for under-five children in Gambella town, Ethiopia. Methods. A case-control study was conducted in March 2017 among caregivers/parents consecutively included in the study. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were, respectively, used for descriptive and analytical data analyses. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI were, respectively, calculated to assess the strength of association and statistical significance. Result. A total of 153 cases and 153 control caregivers/parents participated in the study giving a response rate of 100%. The mean age of cases and controls was 29.4 years (SD ± 6.0 years) and 29.63 years (SD ± 7.8 years), respectively. Being housewife (AOR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.47–4.22), having no history of child mortality (AOR = 3.70; 95% CI: 1.79–7.64), and chewing khat (AOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.57–7.68) were significantly associated with delay in seeking malaria treatment for under-five children among the caregivers. Conclusion and Recommendation. Comprehensive community-based malaria prevention and control education should be given for the caregivers in the town giving due emphasis to housewives, khat-chewers, and the caregivers with no story of child death to better promote early malaria treatment-seeking for under-five children.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Personalised medicine in oncology needs standardised immunological assays. Flow cytometry (FCM) methods represent an essential tool for immunomonitoring, and their harmonisation is crucial to obtain comparable data in multicentre clinical trials. The objective of this study was to design a harmonisation workflow able to address the most effective issues contributing to intra- and interoperator variabilities in a multicentre project. Methods. The Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS) managed a multiparametric flow cytometric panel harmonisation among thirteen operators belonging to five clinical and research centres of Lazio region (Italy). The panel was based on a backbone mixture of dried antibodies (anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD45RA, and anti-CCR7) to detect naïve/memory T cells, recognised as potential prognostic/predictive immunological biomarkers in cancer immunotherapies. The coordinating centre distributed frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fresh whole blood (WB) samples from healthy donors, reagents, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to participants who performed experiments by their own equipment, in order to mimic a real-life scenario. Operators returned raw and locally analysed data to ISS for central analysis and statistical elaboration. Results. Harmonised and reproducible results were obtained by sharing experimental set-up and procedures along with centralising data analysis, leading to a reduction of cross-centre variability for naïve/memory subset frequencies particularly in the whole blood setting. Conclusion. Our experimental and analytical working process proved to be suitable for the harmonisation of FCM assays in a multicentre setting, where high-quality data are required to evaluate potential immunological markers, which may contribute to select better therapeutic options.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To investigate whether preventive administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can reduce the occurrence and development of traumatic granuloma (TG) following type IV-VI cordectomy. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the status of postoperative granulomas in 37 patients who underwent type IV-VI cordectomy due to glottic cancer and determined whether postoperative administration of a PPI had any impact on granuloma formation and development. Results. The percentage and number of patients with granuloma in the PPI treatment group (experimental group) at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th month following surgery were 81.25% (13/16), 25.00% (4/16), 18.75% (3/16), and 0.00% (0/16), respectively. The percentage and number of patients with granuloma in the no-PPI group (control group) were 95.24% (20/21), 71.43% (15/21), 52.38% (11/21), and 14.29% (3/21), respectively. The granuloma percentage of the PPI treatment group was lower than that of the control group at all postoperative time points assessed. The differences were not statistically significant at the 1st month (p=0.175) but were statistically significant at the 2nd and 3rd months after surgery (p=0.005, p=0.037). Conclusion. Preventive use of a PPI in patients after type IV-VI cordectomy can shorten the TG recovery duration and may reduce the severity of TG, but it cannot prevent TG from occurring. Our results should be confirmed by prospective randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To explore the relationship between elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and postoperative delirium (POD). Methods. 206 patients scheduled to receive cervical or lumbar vertebra surgery under general anesthesia for more than 2 hours in a single medical center were observed and analyzed. Patients’ serum CRP, delirious status (using the confusion assessment method (CAM)), and delirious score (using the memorial delirium assessment scale (MDAS)) were examined before surgery and 1-2 days after surgery. The association of a serum CRP elevation value from before to after surgery (D-CRP) with delirium occurrence within 2 days after surgery was assessed with a binary logistic regression model, while the association of D-CRP with the postoperative delirious score was assessed with a linear regression model. The effect of D-CRP on predicting delirium occurrence was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results. D-CRP was significantly positively associated with postoperative delirium occurrence (OR=1.047, 95%CI=1.013, 1.082), and D-CRP was also significantly linearly associated with the postoperative delirious score (β=0.014, 95%CI=0.006, 0.023). AUC of ROC was 0.711 (P=0.014), suggesting that D-CRP had moderate efficacy on predicting postoperative delirium occurrence (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions. Elevated serum CRP after surgery may be a risk factor for and a predictor of postoperative delirium.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. We investigated which benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary parameters are related to upper urinary tract obstruction and whether transurethral prostatectomy could improve upper urinary tract obstruction. Materials and Methods. Patients with prostate size over 30 g and urodynamically proven bladder outlet obstruction were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Bladder wall thickness and prostate size were measured by ultrasonography. A urodynamic study with laboratory tests including serum creatinine, prostate-specific antigen, and urinalysis was performed. Finally, a diuretic scintigraphy using mercaptoacetyltriglycine was performed. Tests except the urodynamic evaluation were repeated after transurethral prostatectomy. Results. In total, 24 patients were enrolled, and 19 patients completed the present study. The mean values of age (yrs), prostate size (mL), bladder thickness (mm), bladder compliance (ΔmL/Δpr), and the bladder outlet obstruction index were 68.42±8.25, 72.29±32.78, 4.42±1.14, 50.17±32.15, and 82.11±34.68, respectively. The mean T1/2 (min) was 17.51±16.34 on the left side and 15.30±11.96 on the right side. Statistical analysis showed that bladder compliance and bladder thickness were preoperatively related to upper urinary tract obstruction (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively). Diuretic mercaptoacetyltriglycine scan in 19 patients showed improvement 6 months after prostate surgery. Clinically significant proteinuria was associated with upper urinary tract obstruction, and proteinuria was also improved after prostate surgery. Conclusion. Storage-phase bladder dysfunction could be a reliable urodynamic factor for the indication of upper urinary tract obstruction in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and upper urinary tract obstruction with subsequent kidney damage could be improved by surgical decompression of benign prostatic obstruction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Shoutai Pill (STP), a famous classic herbal formula documented in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is widely available in China for treating unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of STP in the first trimester of pregnancy in women with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion. Methods. The following eight databases were searched from their establishment to Dec 31, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs): PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese BioMedical database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and the Wanfang database. The quality of evidence was estimated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results. A total of 12 studies (916 patients) with URSA were contained in this meta-analysis. The forest plot showed that patients treated with Shoutai Pill and western medicine had a significantly lower incidence of early pregnancy loss (RR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.34–0.52; P&lt;0.01, I2=0%). Subgroup analysis revealed that different types of TCM syndrome differentiation had the similar results. Also, in the combined group, patients had a lower TCM syndromes and symptoms and serum D-dimer level, while higher incidence of live birth. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that cotreatment with STP and western medicine might be superior to western medicine alone in the first trimester of pregnancy to prevent miscarriage in women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion, and there was no adverse event in the experimental group reported. However, the methodological quality of included RCTs was unsatisfactory; it is necessary to verify its effectiveness with further more standardized researches of rigorous design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fracture characterization is essential for estimating the stimulated reservoir volume and guiding subsequent hydraulic fracturing stimulations in shale reservoirs. Laboratory fracturing experiments can help provide theoretical and technical guidance for field operations. In this study, hydraulic fracturing experiments on the shale samples from Niutitang Formation in Hunan Province (China) under a uniaxial loading condition are conducted. The multifractal method is used to analyze the acoustic emission (AE) signals and characterize fracture initiation and propagation. The hydraulic fracturing process can be divided into three stages based on the characteristics of AE signals: the initial stage, the quite stage, and the fracturing stage. The multifractal analysis results showed that: (1) the value of the spectrum width, Δα, continues to increase as the energy accumulates until the fracturing stage starts; and (2) the difference in the multifractal spectrum values, Δf, reflects the relationship between small and large signal frequencies and can quantify the fracture scale, i.e., the lower the Δf, the larger the fracture scale and vice versa. The results were further verified using a time-frequency analysis of the AE signals and micro-CT scanning of the samples. This study demonstrates that the multifractal method is feasible for quantitatively characterizing hydraulic fractures and can aid field hydraulic fracturing operations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An image target recognition approach based on mixed features and adaptive weighted joint sparse representation is proposed in this paper. This method is robust to the illumination variation, deformation, and rotation of the target image. It is a data-lightweight classification framework, which can recognize targets well with few training samples. First, Gabor wavelet transform and convolutional neural network (CNN) are used to extract the Gabor wavelet features and deep features of training samples and test samples, respectively. Then, the contribution weights of the Gabor wavelet feature vector and the deep feature vector are calculated. After adaptive weighted reconstruction, we can form the mixed features and obtain the training sample feature set and test sample feature set. Aiming at the high-dimensional problem of mixed features, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions. Lastly, the public features and private features of images are extracted from the training sample feature set so as to construct the joint feature dictionary. Based on joint feature dictionary, the sparse representation based classifier (SRC) is used to recognize the targets. The experiments on different datasets show that this approach is superior to some other advanced methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a time-delayed fractional order adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is proposed for a two-wheel self-balancing vehicle system. The closed-loop system is proved based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function. The switching function is designed to make the system robust when facing uncertainties and external disturbances. It is designed to avoid monotonically increasing gains and can handle state-dependent uncertainties without a prior bound. The two-wheel self-balancing vehicle used in the experiment consists of a gyroscope MPU-6050 and accelerometer, a motor driving circuit composed of a motor driving chip TB6612FNG, and STM32F103x8B that is selected as the control core. The experimental results show that the time-delayed fractional order adaptive sliding mode control algorithm can make the vehicle achieve autonomous balance and quickly restore its stable state while appropriate disturbance is introduced.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Missing values in data series is a common problem in many research and applications. Most of existing interpolation methods are based on spatial or temporal interpolation, without considering the spatiotemporal correlation of observation data, resulting in poor interpolation effect. In this paper, a Modified Spatiotemporal Mixed-Effects (MSTME) model for interpolation of spatiotemporal data series is proposed. Experiments with simulated data and real SCIGN data are performed to assess the validity of the proposed model in comparison with Kriged Kalman Filter (KKF) model and Spatiotemporal Mixed-Effects (STME) model. The average improvements of simulated data and SCIGN data for observed stations are around 46% and 19% over the KKF model and 62% and 21% over the STME model, and those for unobserved stations are around 23% and 34% over the KKF model and 41% and 16% over the STME model, respectively, indicating that the proposed MSTME model can achieve better accuracy for interpolating missing values.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Tianming Cai</dc:creator>
<dc:description>China’s economy presents a new normal of speed changes, structural optimization, and power conversion. Deepening supply-side reforms and controlling financial risks are two prominent themes of current economic work. With the economic growth slowing down and the financing environment tightening, the credit risk of the banking industry is being exposed more quickly. This article uses a structured method and an unstructured method to measure the competitiveness of China commercial bank credit market. The structured method uses the HHI (Herfindahl–Hirschman Index), and the unstructured method uses the Lerner Index. This article compares the sample banks’ 2008–2015 industry loan total HHI and Lerner Index. The results of HHI and Lerner Index are basically the same, which indicate that the competitiveness of the China commercial bank credit market is generally at a low level. However, the Lerner Index has a clear upward trend after 2014, which indicates the possibility of increased competition in the credit market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study is to investigate the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and the influencing factors among coal mine workers employed in on-site operations. The job burnout scale and MSD scale were implemented to investigate a random sample of 1,500 coal mine workers working in on-site operations in Xinjiang, China. In total, 1,325 valid questionnaires were collected, with a recovery rate of 88.33% (1,325/1,500). The rate of job burnout was 90%, of which 39.8% were categorized as mild burnout, 43.8% as moderate burnout, and 6.4% as severe burnout; the average job burnout score was 50.77±11.93. The annual prevalence of MSDs was 65.6%, with the highest annual prevalence in the waist (50.7%), followed by the neck, shoulder, and knee, and the lowest prevalence in the elbow (18.8%). Of the areas of the body affected by work-related MSDs, the highest proportion of requests for leave of absence was related to the waist, accounting for 25.7% of requests, while the lowest proportion (13.4%) was related to the wrist. In addition, the incidence of MSDs increased with the years of service. The lowest incidence of MSDs was associated with the two-shift and three-group working pattern. The prevalence of MSDs in the neck and waist was higher in women than in men. The prevalence of MSDs in various body parts increased with the years of service. Moreover, multiple logistic regression indicated that three shifts with four groups (OR=1.096, 95% CI: 0.832-1.445), working more than 10 years (OR=3.396, 95% CI: 2.369-5.748), working more than 20 years (OR=3.008, 95% CI: 1.419-6.337), significant bending (OR=2.062, 95% CI: 1.400-3.038), forward neck tilting (OR=1.572, 95% CI: 1.071-2.281), maximum force operation within a short period of time (OR=1.7222, 95% CI: 1.164-2.547), repeated movement of upper arms or fingers (OR=1.495, 95% CI: 1.034-2.161), slip or fall incidents (OR=1.124, 95% CI: 1.039-1.216), work under conditions of cold or temperature variations (OR=1.911, 95% CI: 1.342-2.720), mild burnout (OR=1.492, 95% CI: 1.016-2.191), moderate burnout (OR=1.852, 95% CI: 1.267-2.708), and severe burnout (OR=2.001, 95% CI: 1.145-3.496) were risk factors for MSDs. In conclusion, there is a high annual prevalence of MSDs among the coal mine workers employed in on-site operations in Xinjiang, China. Measures to reduce this prevalence are required.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Low molecular heparin (LWMH) therapy can prevent the occurrence of VTE in tumor patients and may have a direct antitumor effect. However, the expression pattern of VEGF-A and microRNAs was less reported in cervical cancer subjects who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or received anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) after CCRT (CCRT+LWMH). Methods. In this study, 30 cervical cancer subjects treated with CCRT and 30 cervical cancer patients treated with CCRT+LWMH were enrolled. We screened five miRNAs (miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-195-5p, and miR-205-5p), which have multiple binding sites with VEGF-A and are highly expressed in serum of patients with cervical cancer, by RT-qPCR. The expression level of VEGF-A was also detected by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Statistical methods were used for difference and correlation analyses. Results. We observed the curative effect in the two treatment methods. In the CCRT group, the total effective rate was 60.00%, and in the CCRT+LWMT group, the total effective rate was 83.33% (P=0.013, χ2=6.129). Additionally, the serum levels of VEGF-A in the CCRT+LWMH group were downregulated, relative to the CCRT group (P&lt;0.05), and VEGF-A in serum was significantly positively correlated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) (r=2.134, P=0.035). Only miR-205-5p and miR-195-5p were upregulated in CCRT+LWMH, relative to CCRT (P&lt;0.05). In serum of patients with cervical cancer after CCRT+LWMH treatment, there was no significant correlation between VEGF-A and miR-15a-5p (r=−0.132, P=0.209), miR-16-5p (r=−0.205, P=0.311), or miR-29a-3p (r=−0.029, P=0.662), but VEGF-A was significantly negatively correlated with miR-195-5p (r=−0.396, P=0.040) and miR-205-5p (r=−0.315, P=0.032). Furthermore, VTE was also significantly negatively correlated with miR-195-5p (r=−0.412, P=0.031) and miR-205-5p (r=−0.123, P=0.044). Conclusion. These data revealed roles for VEGF-A and these miRNAs as potential biomarkers in cervical cancer patients with VTE, which exhibited usage potential in the treatment of venous thromboembolism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. In the clinical management of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), preoperative identification of early recurrence (≤2 years) after curative resection is essential. Thus, we aimed to develop a CT-based radiomic signature to predict early recurrence in HSCC patients preoperatively. Methods. In total, 167 HSCC patients who underwent partial surgery were enrolled in this retrospective study and divided into two groups, i.e., the training cohort (n=133) and the validation cohort (n=34). Each individual was followed up for at least for 2 years. Radiomic features were extracted from CT images, and the radiomic signature was built with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression (LR) model. The associations of preoperative clinical factors with early recurrence were evaluated. A radiomic signature-combined model was built, and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to explore their performance in discriminating early recurrence. Results. Among the 1415 features, 335 of them were selected using the variance threshold method. Then, the SelectKBest method was further used for the selection of 31 candidate features. Finally, 11 out of 31 optimal features were identified with the LASSO algorithm. In the LR classifier, the AUCs of the training and validation sets in discriminating early recurrence were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90) (sensitivity 0.8 and specificity 0.83) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.67-0.99) (sensitivity 0.69 and specificity 0.71), respectively. Conclusions. Using the radiomic signature, we developed a radiomic signature to preoperatively predict early recurrence in patients with HSCC, which may serve as a potential noninvasive tool to guide personalized treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, is the initiating event of sepsis and results in immune imbalance by releasing IL-1β and IL-18 in the early stages. Studies show that enhancing autophagy via genetic manipulation can inhibit pyroptosis and prolong the survival of a sepsis animal model, indicating a possible therapeutic strategy against sepsis. However, almost no study so far has achieved pyroptosis inhibition via pharmacological autophagy induction in a sepsis disease model. To this end, we established an in vitro sepsis model by stimulating primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and analyzed the effect of the autophagy agonist rapamycin (RAPA) on pyroptosis. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) activated human THP-1 cells were used as the positive control. LPS significantly increased the levels of the pyroptotic protein Gasdermin D (GSDMD), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase 1 (caspase-1), secreted LDH, IL-1β, and IL-18. RAPA treatment downregulated the above factors and enhanced autophagy in the LPS-stimulated HUVECs and THP-1 cells. This study shows that RAPA abrogates LPS-mediated increase in IL-1β and IL-18 by inhibiting pyroptosis and enhancing autophagy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. In China, the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) diseases and epidemiological trends in the TB forms among children are still unclear; a retrospective study was conducted aiming to assess it. Methods. Between January 2007 and September 2020, 1577 consecutive childhood TB patients (aged ≤ 15 years) were included in the study. Data, including demographic information and underlying diseases, were collected from medical records. Then, patients were categorized and reported according to the anatomical site of TB disease. To analyze the epidemiological trends in the proportion of each form of TB disease, a linear-by-linear association was used, and a P value of &lt;0.05 was considered to indicate that a significant change had occurred in the proportion of TB disease over the studied period. Results. During the fourteen-year study period, a total of 1577 children patients were enrolled, including 954 boys (60.5%) and 623 girls (39.5%), with a mean age of 9.26±5.18 years. Among the studied patients, 810 (51.4%) patients have pulmonary TB, 1137 (72.1%) have extrapulmonary TB, 372 (23.6%) have both conditions, and another 765 (48.5%) extrapulmonary cases presented in isolated form. Pleural TB (29.0%) and tuberculous lymphadenitis (23.7%) were the most frequent two forms of childhood TB. In addition, during the past decade, the proportions of pulmonary TB, pleural TB, and tuberculous lymphadenitis showed an increasing trend (all P&lt;0.05). However, no significant trends in the proportions of other forms of TB disease, such as extrapulmonary TB (P&gt;0.05), tuberculous meningitis (P&gt;0.05), endobronchial TB (P&gt;0.05), and disseminated TB (P&gt;0.05), were found. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that childhood TB is facing new challenges, and the policy should be adjusted timely to fit the real situation.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zhan Zhou</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper concerns the existence of solutions for the Dirichlet boundary value problems of p-Laplacian difference equations containing both advance and retardation depending on a parameter λ. Under some suitable assumptions, infinitely many solutions are obtained when λ lies in a given open interval. The approach is based on the critical point theory.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ubiquitination is a three-step enzymatic cascade for posttranslational protein modification. It includes the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyse the posttranslational proteolytic and nonproteolytic functions in various physiological and pathological processes, such as inflammation-associated signal transduction. Resulting from the diversity of substrates and functional mechanisms, RING-type ligases regulate microbe recognition and inflammation by being involved in multiple inflammatory signalling pathways. These processes also occur in autoimmune diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand the importance of RING-type ligases in inflammation, we have discussed their functional mechanisms in multiple inflammation-associated pathways and correlation between RING-type ligases and IBD. Owing to the limited data on the biology of RING-type ligases, there is an urgent need to analyse their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in IBD in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Preclinical studies support the anticancer activity of statins; however, the existing clinical evidence is inconsistent and not definitive. Our study aimed at evaluating a postulated cancer chemo-sensitizing effect of statin (simvastatin) in a cohort of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. We designed a prospective, single-centered, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial that encompassed MBC patients with an ECOG Performance Status Scale ≤2 and scheduled to be treated with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin and vinorelbine every 3 weeks at Al-Baironi Hospital, Damascus, Syria. Patients were enrolled between August 2011 and July 2012 and randomly allocated to receive a 15-day course of either simvastatin (40 mg) or placebo seven days prior to the first day of each chemotherapy cycle and then continued for eight days in each individual cycle. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and toxicity, and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Eighty-two patients met the inclusion criteria and consented. ORR (35% vs. 32.5%) and predominant toxicity and grade ≥3 neutropenia (occurred in 30% vs. 40% of the patients) were not significantly different between simvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 10–60), median OS was 15 months in the simvastatin group and 17 the in placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI (0.70–1.91), P=0.57). Elevated baseline values of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP &gt;10 mg/l), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH &gt;480 U/L), and chemotherapy being ≥2nd line were significantly associated with shorter OS for the total cohort in both Univariate and multivariate analyses. Our data prove a safe profile of simvastatin at 40 mg per day combined with carboplatin and vinorelbine in MBC patients but without any beneficial increase of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Moreover, we demonstrated a strong clinical advantage of baseline values of hsCRP and LDH as useful prognostic tools in MBC patients. This trial is registered with ISRCTN12964275.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The main purpose of this paper is to consider the strong law of large numbers for random sets in fuzzy metric space. Since many years ago, limited theorems have been expressed and proved for fuzzy random variables, but despite the uncertainty in fuzzy discussions, the nonfuzzy metric space has been used. Given that the fuzzy random variable is defined on the basis of random sets, in this paper, we generalize the strong law of large numbers for random sets in the fuzzy metric space. The embedded theorem for compact convex sets in the fuzzy normed space is the most important tool to prove this generalization. Also, as a result and by application, we use the strong law of large numbers for random sets in the fuzzy metric space for the bootstrap mean.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Severe dengue infections in a postoperative patient may lead to significant derangement in the body’s homeostasis resulting in morbidity and sometimes even mortality. Reports on presentation and clinical manifestations of dengue in patients following major surgical procedures are scarce and restricted to few case reports. We describe a 26-year-old male with atypical presentation and late detection of dengue haemorrhagic fever following a major abdominal surgery. On postoperative day 6, he developed spontaneous bleeding from the drain site and moderate-to-massive bilateral pleural effusion with respiratory distress. His dengue IgM and IgG were positive. Therefore, a diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever with bilateral lower zone pneumonia was made. A right-sided intercostal tube was inserted. Intensive care was given and was managed with intravenous antibiotics, targeted fluid therapy, and supportive care. He recovered from the infection and was discharged uneventfully. This case is unique because during the postoperative period, he went into critical phase with significant fluid leakage and developed bleeding manifestations without a clear febrile phase and deterioration in the haemodynamic parameters. High degree of suspicion and early detection are necessary to guide the fluid therapy and provide organ support in such patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is an extremely rare cutaneous neoplasm of the apocrine or eccrine sweat glands. Solid and cystic glandular structures with cribriform and tubular architecture along with CK5/6, pankeratin and p63 immuno-profile set apart SCACP from other cutaneous malignancies. Wide local excision (WLE) has been the mainstay treatment for localized SCACP; however, no standard treatment has yet been established for unresectable or metastatic disease. Herein, we report a 74-year-old male with SCACP, who initially presented with a painful nodule on the upper back and later developed metastatic disease. He was treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel with concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which resulted in disease stabilization for 12 months. Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a total of 18 genomic alterations associated with potential benefit from targeted therapeutics. PD-L1 expression was identified in 70% of tumor cells. These findings suggest that the opportunity of targeted therapeutics and immunotherapy exist as for metastatic SCACP. Reporting molecular profile of the rare tumors with no established standard treatment options should be encouraged.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An enhanced method able to perform accurate stability of constrained uncertain systems is presented. The main objective of this method is to compute a sequence of feedback control laws which stabilizes the closed-loop system. The proposed approach is based on robust model predictive control (RMPC) and enhanced maximized sets algorithm (EMSA), which are applied to improve the performance of the closed-loop system and achieve less conservative results. In fact, the proposed approach is split into two parts. The first is a method of enhanced maximized ellipsoidal invariant sets (EMES) based on a semidefinite programming problem. The second is an enhanced maximized polyhedral set (EMPS) which consists of appending new vertices to their convex hull to minimize the distance between each new vertex and the polyhedral set vertices to ensure state constraints. Simulation results on two examples, an uncertain nonisothermal CSTR and an angular positioning system, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology when compared to other works related to a similar subject. According to the performance evaluation, we recorded higher feedback gain provided by smallest maximized invariant sets compared to recently studied methods, which shows the best region of stability. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can achieve less conservative results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effects of hardware impairments with imperfect channel estimation for cache-enabled UAV networks are studied in this paper. The effects of the setup parameters, such as the number of cached or relaying nodes, the hardware impairment factor, the channel estimation error, and the transmission SNR, on the outage probability are present by deriving the exact closed-form expressions on outage probability. Also, the asymptotic results are present when the transmission SNR is large enough. From the asymptotic analysis, we can see that there is an error floor introduced by the hardware impairments and imperfect channel estimation. Specifically, the error floor is dependent on the channel estimation error factor, the hardware impairment distortion factor, and the QoS requirements. And the diversity order of the error floor for the cached/relaying links is equal to the number of cached/relaying UAV nodes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the biomedical literature increases exponentially, biomedical named entity recognition (BNER) has become an important task in biomedical information extraction. In the previous studies based on deep learning, pretrained word embedding becomes an indispensable part of the neural network models, effectively improving their performance. However, the biomedical literature typically contains numerous polysemous and ambiguous words. Using fixed pretrained word representations is not appropriate. Therefore, this paper adopts the pretrained embeddings from language models (ELMo) to generate dynamic word embeddings according to context. In addition, in order to avoid the problem of insufficient training data in specific fields and introduce richer input representations, we propose a multitask learning multichannel bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) model. Multiple feature representations (e.g., word-level, contextualized word-level, character-level) are, respectively, or collectively fed into the different channels. Manual participation and feature engineering can be avoided through automatic capturing features in BiGRU. In merge layer, multiple methods are designed to integrate the outputs of multichannel BiGRU. We combine BiGRU with the conditional random field (CRF) to address labels’ dependence in sequence labeling. Moreover, we introduce the auxiliary corpora with same entity types for the main corpora to be evaluated in multitask learning framework, then train our model on these separate corpora and share parameters with each other. Our model obtains promising results on the JNLPBA and NCBI-disease corpora, with F1-scores of 76.0% and 88.7%, respectively. The latter achieves the best performance among reported existing feature-based models.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yunfei Xie</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shichun Chi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to reduce the differential settlement of piled raft foundations, an optimization method based on pile-to-pile interaction theory is proposed in this paper, which translates the problem of pile-to-pile interaction (PPI) in pile groups into that in single piles using the interaction factor method. The pile lengths were adjusted via the relationship between load, settlement, and the length of single piles during the optimization design. ANSYS software, in conjunction with nonlinear elastic soil model, is used to analyze piled raft foundation models. Two cases with different safety factors that suffer different kinds of surface loads (uniform load and nonuniform load) are used to verify this method. The differential settlements of the raft in different cases are all reduced by nearly or more than 80% after optimization design. The results show that the optimization method proposed in this paper has high efficiency and stability. This study can help practicing engineers optimize the pile lengths in pile groups to satisfy higher differential settlement requirements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In underground mining and roadway support engineering of coal mine, the coal and rock layers bear loads together; therefore, the deformation and mechanical characteristics of the coal-rock combined bodies are not the same as those of the pure coal or rock bodies. In this paper, conventional triaxial compression tests of coal-rock combined bodies with different height ratios were conducted. And the stress and deformation characteristics of coal-rock combined body were studied and the experimental results were analyzed with different strength criteria. The results show that the peak stress, elastic modulus, and strength reduction coefficient of coal-rock combined body are negatively correlated with the ratio of coal to coal-rock combination height and positively correlated with the confining pressure; the coal-rock combination shows obvious ductility under 10 MPa confining pressure. Under the conventional triaxial condition, the shear failure was the main cause of the lateral deformation of the coal body in the coal-rock combination, which was much larger than that of the rock body. The circle deformation value, volume strain value, and the deformation rate in the postpeak stage of coal-rock combination are much higher than those in the prepeak stage. Mohr–Coulomb and general Hoek–Brown strength criterion fit the experimental results well.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to understand the influence of unloading path on the mechanical properties of coal, triaxial unloading confining pressure tests with different initial confining pressure and different unloading rate were carried out. The test results show that the triaxial unloading strength of coal samples under different test conditions is lower than conventional triaxial tests, but the brittleness characteristics are more obvious. This result indicates that the coal samples are easily damaged under unloading conditions. In the axial loading stage of the confinement unloading tests, the axial strain plays a leading role. However, during the confining pressure unloading stage, the circumferential deformation is large, which is the main deformation in this stage. Higher unloading rates of confining pressure are associated with shorter times between the peak stress position and sample complete failure. This shows that samples are more easily destroyed under higher unloading rates and the samples are more difficultly destroyed under lower unloading rates. In addition, with increasing unloading rate, the peak principal stress difference and confining pressure at failure decrease gradually, whereas the confining pressure difference at failure increases gradually. Compared with conventional triaxial compression tests, the cohesion of coal is reduced and the internal friction angle is increased under the condition of triaxial unloading test.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Period genes are important core clock genes, including PER1, PER2, and PER3. A number of studies have demonstrated that the abnormal expression of the PER gene family of clock genes is associated with the survival and prognosis of patients with cancer; however, the sample sizes included in the majority of these studies were small, and the reported results were inconsistent. This study was the first to collect the relevant publications to systematically evaluate the value of the expression of the PER gene family in the prediction of survival and prognosis of human tumors. Methods. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched systematically, and a meta-analysis was performed. Results. A total of 12 eligible publications met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, including 1,369 patients and 9 different types of cancer. The pooled hazard ratio for overall survival indicated that the overall survival of patients in the high PER1, PER2, and PER3 protein expression group was significantly higher than that in the low-expression group, respectively. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the result was stable and reliable. The association between PER1 and PER3 mRNA expression levels and cancer prognosis was not meta-analyzed as the number of experimental studies was &lt;3. There was no significant association between the expression of PER2 mRNA and the overall survival of patients with cancer. Conclusion. PER1, PER2, and PER3 protein expression levels can be used as novel potential biomarkers for predicting cancer prognosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In a distributed system, cross-domain access control is an important mechanism to realize secure data sharing among multiple domains. Most of the existing cross-domain access control mechanisms are generally based on a single-server architecture, which has limitations in terms of security and reliability (the access decision may be incorrect) and completeness and confidentiality (the access records can be modified). Blockchain technology with decentralization, verifiability, and immutability properties can solve these problems. Motivated by these facts, in this article, we construct a trusted and efficient cross-domain access control system based on blockchain. Consequently, we integrate blockchain and role mapping technology to provide reliable and verifiable cross-domain access process. We use blockchain to record user roles, role mapping rules, access policies, and audit records, realizing user self-validation, and access nonreputation. Considering the low throughput of the blockchain, we design an efficient smart contract to make the access decision based on the access history of users. Finally, a performance evaluation of the system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Nurses working in the intensive care unit play an essential role in detecting patients at risk of deterioration through ongoing assessment and action in response to changing health status. Objectives. To assess knowledge, attitude, and associated factors towards physical assessment on critically ill patients among nurses working in the intensive care unit at Amhara regional state referral hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019. The research hypothesis: there is poor physical assessment knowledge, poor physical assessment attitude, and there are factors that are likely to affect nurses’ knowledge and attitude towards physical assessment providing this care to critically ill patients at Amhara regional state referral hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019. Methods. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 299 nurses from March to September 2019. A convenience sampling method was used. Data were entered by using Epi Info 7.2.2 and analyzed by using STATA 14. The result was computed by descriptive statistics and to explore predictors of knowledge, and attitude linear regression analysis models were fitted, and the adjusted unstandardized beta (β) coefficient at 95% CI was used. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Result and conclusion: the knowledge mean scores were 9.93 ± 2.99 [95% CI (9.59, 10.31)]. The proportion of nurse’s knowledge who score above the mean was 167 (55.9%) [95% CI (50.2, 61.5)] and below the mean 132 (44.1%) [95% CI (38.5, 49.8)]. Attitude means scores were 36.85 ± 6.21 [(36.16, 37.51)]. The proportions of nurse’s attitudes who score above the mean were 158 (52.8%) [95% CI (47.5, 58.5)] and below the mean 141 (47.2) [95% CI (41.5, 52.5)]. Regarding predictor variables, being male [β = 0.84, 95% CI (0.16, 1.52)] and taken training [β = 1.85, 95% CI (1.14, 2.56)] were factors positively associated with knowledge, whereas has taken training [β = 4.13, 95% CI (2.82, 5.44)], total years of experience [β = 0.59, 95% CI (0.25, 0.93)], and knowledge [β = 0.92, 95% CI (0.0.72, 1.12)] were factors positively associated with attitude towards physical assessment. Conclusion. Based on the result of this study, the knowledge and attitude towards physical assessment regarding critically ill patients among nurses working in intensive care units were good. Hence, training, educational support services, and awareness are recommended to encourage nurse’s knowledge and attitude towards physical assessment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The aim of this study was to compare the daily costs and cost effectiveness of fixed combination glaucoma drugs in China. Methods. This study included the following fixed combination drugs: brinzolamide 1% and timolol 0.5% (Azarga; Alcon, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA), travoprost 0.004% and timolol 0.5% (DuoTrav; Alcon, Inc.), bimatoprost 0.03% and timolol 0.5% (Ganfort; Allergan, Inc., Dublin, Ireland), and latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5% (Xalacom; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA). Five bottles of each drug were measured. The mean actual volume, mean actual number of drops, volume per drop, daily cost, yearly cost, and per mmHg reduction cost for each drug were calculated. Results. The volumes per drop ranged from 32.61 ± 2.90 μl (DuoTrav) to 24.38 ± 0.23 μl (Ganfort). The number of usage days per bottle varied from 36 days (DuoTrav) to 61 days (Ganfort). Azarga had the lowest daily cost ($0.23) and yearly cost ($84.72), while DuoTrav had the highest daily cost ($0.79) and yearly cost ($287.02). Azarga costed $2.17–$3.30 per mmHg intraocular pressure reduction, which was lower than the other three drugs. For the prostaglandin and ß-adrenergic blocker FCs, Ganfort had the lowest daily cost ($0.35) and per mmHg reduction cost (from $3.40 to $4.04). Conclusions. The daily costs of these drugs were significantly different, with Azarga having the lowest daily cost and best cost effectiveness. For the prostaglandin and β-adrenergic blocker fixed combinations, Ganfort was the most economical choice with its lower daily cost and per mmHg reduction cost. The results of this study could provide drug selection guidance from an economic perspective, but various factors should be considered when making a decision.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Conservation of paper-based materials, namely, manuscripts, includes repair of tears, gap filling, consolidation, and fixation, which requires the use of adhesives. The adhesive in use for these purposes should be compatible with the chemical and physical properties of paper and should present good aging characteristics. In this study, we conducted a set of experiments with paper samples on which fructan-based biopolymer Halomonas levan (Hlevan) was applied for the first time and compared with glucan-based adhesive starch. Adhesive-applied samples were initially prepared by the application of different historical recipes of sizing and ink. Then, they underwent accelerated thermal aging. Chemical and physical changes of paper samples (crystallinity, pH, and color) were analyzed. Finally, Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify dominating factors affecting sample behavior with applied adhesives. This study demonstrates the aging characteristics of Hlevan on cellulose-based materials. The results showed that there is a color shift from blue to yellow for all samples after aging, but it is more pronounced for some samples with Hlevan. In addition, Hlevan is slightly less acidic than starch in all cases and acted as a plasticizer for a specific kind of sizing material. The methodology of this research is also efficacious in terms of understanding the interaction of paper media with the adhesives and their effects on aging.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Health-related physical fitness is vital for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) to gain healthier lives. The adapted rhythmic gymnastics (ARG) program was designed for children with IDD and is aimed at testing the effects of the exercise program on children’s physical fitness. Methods. Participants were recruited from two special needs schools in Beijing of China. Twenty-two children with IDD were assigned to an ARG experimental group or a traditional control group. The experimental group took part in a 16-week ARG program consisting of three 50 min sessions each week. And children’s body composition, aerobic capacity, and musculoskeletal functioning were measured by the Brockport Physical Fitness Test (BPFT) before and after the program. Results. The between-group analysis revealed great improvements for the experimental group in abdominal strength (curl-up test: p=0.025&lt;0.05) and upper limb strength (dumbbell press test: p=0.038&lt;0.05). Compared to the pretest, most of the physical fitness parameters improved significantly in the experimental group except BMI, and flexibility of the experimental group children showed a substantial increase. Conclusions. Most of the physical fitness parameters of children with IDD in the experimental group improved significantly, especially on abdominal strength and upper limb muscle strength when comparing to the control group.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gene differential expression studies can serve to explore and understand the laws and characteristics of animal life activities, and the difference in gene expression between different animal tissues has been well demonstrated and studied. However, for the world-famous rare and protected species giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), only the transcriptome of the blood and spleen has been reported separately. Here, in order to explore the transcriptome differences between the different tissues of the giant panda, transcriptome profiles of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney from five captive giant pandas were constructed with Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The comparative analysis of the intertissue gene expression patterns was carried out based on the generated RNA sequencing datasets. Analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed according to the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We generated 194.52 GB clean base data from twenty-five sequencing libraries and identified 18,701 genes, including 3492 novel genes. With corrected p value &lt;0.05 and |log2FoldChange| &gt;2, we finally obtained 921, 553, 574, 457, and 638 tissue-specific DEGs in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, respectively. In addition, we identified TTN, CAV3, LDB3, TRDN, and ACTN2 in the heart; FGA, AHSG, and SERPINC1 in the liver; CD19, CD79B, and IL21R in the spleen; NKX2-4 and SFTPB in the lung; GC and HRG in the kidney as hub genes in the PPI network. The results of the analyses showed a similar gene expression pattern between the spleen and lung. This study provided for the first time the heart, liver, lung, and kidney’s transcriptome resources of the giant panda, and it provided a valuable resource for further genetic research or other potential research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Primary peritoneal carcinosarcomas which arise from extragenital locations are extremely rare. Carinosarcomas contain both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements and can be mainly detected in the female genital tract. We herein report a case of primary peritoneal carcinosarcoma diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery and treated with olaparib. A 62-year-old woman referred to our hospital due to abdominal distension. From imaging findings, we suspected advanced primary peritoneal carcinoma, and laparoscopic surgery was thereafter performed. The pathological diagnosis was carcinosarcoma, and the patient received chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin. After three cycles of chemotherapy, the interval debulking surgery was attempted but resulted in suboptimal results. Because the bilateral ovaries were observed with a normal size and normal findings, we considered that the most likely diagnosis was primary peritoneal carcinosarcoma. After the additional chemotherapy and a 6-month observation period, the tumor relapsed. The patient received chemotherapy again, and the peritoneal carcinosarcoma was judged to be a platinum-sensitive tumor. Oral administration of olaparib was thus initiated. Although a dose reduction was needed due to anemia, olaparib was effective, and the patient could continue the drug for another 7 months. This is the first report of primary peritoneal carcinosarcoma treated with olaparib and shows that it could be a treatment option for platinum-sensitive tumors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rotigotine transdermal patch (RTP) is a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD). Some PD patients cannot continue RTP treatment due to application site reactions. We explored sites for RTP where application site reactions are less severe than those in the six approved application sites. Thirty PD patients (12 men, mean age = 76 years) who underwent RTP at the approved sites and had some application site reactions were enrolled in this study. When applying the RTP to the approved application sites for more than four weeks (pre-RTP) and then on the shin for the following four weeks (post-RTP), skin reactions, itching evaluated using the skin irritation score, motor symptoms, clinical global impressions scale, and plasma rotigotine concentration were examined. The mean visual analogue scale and skin irritation score in the post-RTP group were significantly lower than those in the pre-RTP group. The mean Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III score in the post-RTP group was slightly but significantly lower than that in the pre-RTP group. Plasma rotigotine concentration in the post-RTP group was slightly but significantly lower than that in the pre-RTP group. These results indicate that the shin can be a useful application site for RTP.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The implantation of a radial head prosthesis can take place as a therapeutic option after radial head fracture. There are various implants for this purpose. Many studies and case reports about silastic radial head prosthesis implantation describe foreign body reactions with accompanying synovitis and poor functional results. A few studies have investigated the reason for the material failure and the accompanying synovitis. The case report presented shows an unusually long durability of an in situ 14-year silastic radial head prosthesis. 14 years after implantation, a previously full-time working and healthy patient presented himself with a dislocation of the silastic radial head prosthesis and atraumatic joint blockage of the right elbow triggered by a negligible movement. The prosthesis was removed surgically. We found a macroscopic foreign body reaction intraoperatively. In a histopathological examination, with hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) in 40x and 100x magnification, we have seen an aseptic inflammatory response to foreign bodies with activated epithelial cells and multinucleated giant cells with intracytoplasmic foreign material. Due to these problems, the silastic radial head prosthesis is no longer used today. However, there are still patients with the implanted silastic radial head prosthesis, which should therefore be checked regularly. A metal prosthesis also does not seem to be an optimal alternative due to cartilage wear and loss of ROM. The choice of prosthesis material should be selected carefully and patient-specific in radial head prosthetics according of the results presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the protective effect of a fermented wheat germ extract (FWGE) against LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in IPEC-J2 porcine intestinal epithelial cells was studied. Enterocytes were treated with LPS derived from Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O55:B5, O111:B4, and O127:B8 strains. Intracellular ROS level and extracellular H2O2 level were followed up by two fluorescent assays (DCFH-DA and Amplex Red). The effect of FWGE on the intestinal barrier integrity was determined by transepithelial electric resistance measurements and using a FD4 fluorescent tracer dye. IL-6 concentration of supernatants was also measured by the ELISA method. Our data revealed that FWGE had a significant lowering effect on the inflammatory response especially related to oxidative stress. Treatment with FWGE (1-2%) significantly decreased the level of intracellular ROS compared to LPS-treated cells. Furthermore, LPS-triggered partial disruption of epithelial integrity was reduced after FWGE application.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents the comparison of three methodologies to detect if some fans in a matrix are not working properly. These methodologies are based on detecting fan failures by analysing acoustic images of the fan matrix, obtained using a planar array of MEMS microphones. Geometrical parameters of these acoustic images for different frequencies are then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, in order to detect the fan failures. One of the methodologies is based on the detection of the faulty fan in the matrix, under the hypothesis that only one fan can fail. Other methodology is based on the detection of the specific working situation of the matrix. And finally, the third methodology that is compared is based on determining individually if each of the fans of the matrix is working properly or not. The comparison shows that this third methodology is the most reliable.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sanhuang Xiexin Decoction (SXD) is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In order to elucidate the specific analysis mechanisms of SXD for T2DM, the method of network pharmacology was applied to this article. First, the effective ingredients of SXD were obtained and their targets were identified based on the TCMSP database. The T2DM-related targets screened from the GEO database were also collected by comparing the differential expressed genes between T2DM patients and healthy individuals. Then, the common targets in SXD-treated T2DM were obtained by intersecting the putative targets of SXD and the differential expressed genes of T2DM. And the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was established using the above common targets to screen key genes through protein interactions. Meanwhile, these common targets were used for GO and KEGG analyses to further elucidate how they exert antidiabetic effects. Finally, a gene pathway network was established to capture the core one in common targets enriched in the major pathways to further illustrate the role of specific genes. Based on the data obtained, a total of 67 active compounds and 906 targets of SXD were identified. Four thousand one hundred and seventy-six differentially expressed genes with a P value &lt; 0.005 and ∣log2fold change∣&gt;0.5 were determined between T2DM patients and control groups. After further screening, thirty-seven common targets related to T2DM in SXD were finally identified. Through protein interactions, the top 5 genes (YWHAZ, HNRNPA1, HSPA8, HSP90AA1, and HSPA5) were identified. It was found that the functional annotations of target genes were associated with oxygen levels, protein kinase regulator, mitochondria, and so on. The top 20 pathways including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cancers, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were significantly enriched. CDKN1A was shown to be the core gene in the gene-pathway network, and other several genes such as CCND1, ERBB2, RAF1, EGF, and VEGFA were the key genes for SXD against T2DM. Based on the network pharmacology approach, we identified key genes and pathways related to the prognosis and pathogenesis of T2DM and also provided a feasible method for further studying the chemical basis and pharmacology of SXD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to address the lack of collaborative decision and failure to notice the emergency and fairness of relief after disasters have occurred, a collaborative decision-making system for emergency relief materials dispatching is established. According to the forecast of the demand for postdisaster relief materials, the entropy weight-TOPSIS method is applied to measure the urgency of the disaster area; then, a “Hub-and-Spoke” dispatching network is constructed. In this paper, a multiobjective collaborative relief material dispatching model is built, which has great performance in terms of minimal distribution cost and maximal fairness, and the objective of fairness requires minimizing the penalty cost caused by unsatisfied demands. Based on the urgency of demand points, the simulated annealing algorithm is designed to solve the Pareto disaggregation of multiobjective optimization model. The performance of the model is verified with the case of Wenchuan Earthquake. The results indicate that if the fair distribution of supplies is emphasized, it will increase the number of rescue vehicles and the number of distribution batches. On the other hand, a variety of relief material dispatching plans can be provided based on calculation of the Pareto front for policy-makers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Since December 2019, novel coronavirus- (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout China. This study is aimed at describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Methods. 199 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in China from January 24th to March 15th. The cases were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups according to the history of taking antidiabetic drugs or by plasma fasting blood glucose level at admission, and the difference between groups were compared. Results. Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO2), and higher mortality (P&lt;0.05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6×109/L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death. Antidiabetic drugs were associated with decreasing odds of death. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was not related to odds of death. Conclusion. The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was significantly higher than those without diabetes. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6×109/L at admission were the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accumulating evidence has supported an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women and elderly men diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. However, it is not uncommon for young and middle-aged male patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to suffer from osteopenia or osteoporosis. Few studies focused on this population group are available. The aim of this study is to evaluate bone metabolic status and investigate the influence of T2DM on bone metabolism in 30-50-year-old men. Anthropometric assessment and blood samples were obtained from 160 patients with T2DM and 69 nondiabetic volunteers. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone turnover markers (BTMs), including serum procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP), osteocalcin (OC), and β-cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX), were analysed. No significant differences were observed based on age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, total protein, and albumin levels when comparing T2DM and control groups. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly increased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased in the T2DM group. Compared with controls, diabetic patients showed lower serum PINP, OC, and PTH levels, whereas serum β-CTX levels were similar between the two groups. Moreover, HbA1c levels were positively correlated with PINP and inversely associated with PTH levels. TG levels were negatively correlated with OC or β-CTX levels. Furthermore, multiple linear regression revealed a positive correlation between HbA1c and PINP levels. These results also revealed a negative association between HbA1c and PTH, and between TG and OC levels, even after adjusting for expected confounder factors. Collectively, these findings indicated that young and middle-aged male patients with T2DM showed a lower turnover state resulting from bone formation inhibition. Glucose and lipid metabolic disorders may affect bone formation through different pathways.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Common beans are a leguminous plant of the genus Phaseolus. They are rich in protein, energy, and minerals. They confer a wide range of health benefits when consumed. Utilization of common bean has however been poor due to high antinutrient content that results in reduced nutrient digestibility and mineral bioavailability. Flatulence after consumption is also a huge deterrent to common bean consumption. Lactic acid fermentation is the most common form of food fermentation with the Lactobacilli spp dominating most spontaneous fermentations. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the antinutrient and flatulence causing oligosaccharide composition of red haricot bean. A factorial research design was used in the study. Red haricot beans were sorted and soaked for 15 h. The soaked beans were fermented in 2% salt-sugar solutions for 120 h. Experimental batch was inoculated with Lb. plantarum BFE 5092 (IF), and the control batch was spontaneously fermented (SF). Microbial growth and pH were monitored every 24 h during fermentation. After fermentation, the beans were dried and milled, and the flours were subjected to biochemical analysis. ANOVA was done using SPSS statistics 23. The pH decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) from 6.06 to 3.9 in both batches at the end of fermentation. The LAB counts significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) in both batches, whereas coliform counts decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05). Fungi were not detected in both batches. Soaking lowered tannins and phytates and raffinose concentrations significantly but had no significant effect on stachyose concentration. At the end of 120 h of fermentation, the tannin content was 109.50 and 54.04 mg/100 g in IF and SF, respectively. Phytates were at 242.52 and 163.43 mg/100 g in IF and SF, respectively. Raffinose content was 32.85 and 32.58 mg/100 g in IF and SF, respectively, while stachyose content was 593.33 and 467.49 mg/100 g in IF and SF, respectively. This research showed that LAB is able to ferment soaked whole red haricot and lower the tannin, phytate, raffinose, and stachyose content significantly. Spontaneous fermentation lowered these antinutrients and oligosaccharides better than inoculation with Lb. plantarum BFE 5092.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Meng Jia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The image encryption schemes developing more sensitive and more chaotic maps are used as a key sequence generator, such as cascade chaotic maps and high-dimension maps. High-dimension chaotic maps can generate sequences with little correlation after hundred times of iteration. In fact, the sequence is just a flow of the manifold of the chaotic system. A fast way to select sensitive flows of the dynamic systems is introduced in the paper. Combining with the divided blocks diffusion algorithm, the novel scheme yields the cipher image more randomly. Experimental results show that the sensitive flows of the high-dimension system can generate a series with better ergodicity and less correlation compared with the common flows of the same system. The encryption efficiency is enhanced by choosing the sensitive flows of the high-dimension system. The analysis proved that the novel image encryption scheme can resist all common kinds of attacks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We report the case of a 69-year-old male patient with extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon rupture associated with a scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC) wrist. He could not actively extend the left thumb interphalangeal joint and visited our institution for an examination. Plain X-rays revealed advanced stage SNAC and an enlarged soft tissue shadow owing to dorsal ridge growth. The patient was diagnosed with EPL tendon subcutaneous rupture due to SNAC. During surgery, the EPL tendon was found to be absent, a proximal-type scaphoid nonunion was detected, and bone growth to the dorsal part of the dorsal ridge was observed. Considering that the EPL tendon rupture was associated with the bone growth, we performed scaphoid lunate advanced collapse (SLAC) reconstruction and extensor indicis proprius tendon transfer which needed a revision tendon surgery afterward. To the best of our knowledge, EPL tendon ruptures caused by SLAC or SNAC are considered rare and have not yet been reported.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yuzhen Wen</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Chuancun Yin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the expected discounted utility of dividend payments for an insurance company taking into account the time value of ruin. We assume the preference of the insurer is of the CRRA form. The discounting factor is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion. We introduce the VaR control levels for the insurer to control its loss in reinsurance strategies. By solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we obtain the value function and the corresponding optimal strategy. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the results and analyze the VaR control levels on the optimal strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Distal trochanteric transfer (DTT) has been widely performed to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip or Perthes disease. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) following DTT in patients with hip osteoarthritis is one of the most challenging procedures for hip surgeons, because great care must be taken regarding anatomical abnormalities of the greater trochanter and the soft tissue attached to the greater trochanter. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on THA after DTT. We herein report two cases of patients who underwent THA post DTT using cementless components. After THA, both patients developed abduction temporary contraction because of leg length extension and gluteus medius hypertension. However, in both cases, the contraction was reversible within two months and the final clinical result was good. Therefore, THA can be considered an effective and safe choice for treating osteoarthritis after DTT.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Murraya koenigii is well documented in the Indian ancient medical text “Charaka Samhita.” The carbazole alkaloid “mahanine” from this plant exhibited anticancer activity against several cancers. Here, we have taken a comprehensive study to standardize the method for the preparation of a mahanine-enriched fraction (MEF) with the highest yield and defined markers. Our optimized method produced MEF having the highest amount of mahanine, a major marker, with excellent in vitro antiproliferative activity against ovarian and breast cancer cells as evidenced by decreased cell viability by MTT assay. Moreover, it exhibited condensed and fragmented nuclei by DAPI staining and increased annexin V-/PI-stained cells after MEF treatment, indicating apoptosis. It also exhibited good efficacy in ovarian and breast cancer syngeneic mice models, with an ED50 of 300 mg/kg body weight (BW). MEF is stable up to 40°C for ≥3 months. Its biological activity remains unchanged at a wide range of pH (1-10) for up to ~3 hours, indicating a safe oral route of administration. Additionally, the comparative pharmacokinetics of MEF and mahanine in rats showed a 31% higher bioavailability of mahanine in MEF-fed rats compared to rats fed with mahanine alone. Furthermore, mice fed with MEF at 5000 mg/kg BW single dose, 300-1500 mg/kg BW/day for 14 days, and 300 mg/kg BW/day for 28, 90, and 180 days for subacute, subchronic, chronic studies, respectively, did not show any significant clinical signs of toxicity, behavioral changes, mortality, organ weights, serum biochemistry, and hematological parameters indicating no/minimum toxicity for up to 180 days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the pH/temperature stability and chronic toxicity studies of MEF along with in vivo efficacy against breast cancer. Taken together, our study will enhance the commercial value of this highly potential medicinal plant and will be helpful as a reference material for its clinical development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a dynamic two-stage Cournot duopoly game with R&amp;D efforts is built. Then, the local stability of the equilibrium points are discussed, and the stability condition of the Nash equilibrium point is also deduced through Jury criterion. The complex dynamical behaviors of the built model are investigated by numerical simulations. We found that the unique route to chaos is flip bifurcation, and the increase of adjusting speed will cause the system to lose stability and produce more complex dynamic behavior. In addition, we also found the phenomenon of multistability in the given model. Several kinds of coexistence of attractors are shown. In particular, we found that boundary attractors can coexist with internal attractors, which also aggravates the complexity of the system. At last, the chaotic state in the built system has been successfully controlled.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Compound Kushen injection (CKI) has been extensively used in treating breast cancer (BC). However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, 16 active compounds of CKI were obtained from 3 articles for target prediction. Then, a compound-predicted target network and a compound-BC target network were conducted by Cytoscape 3.6.1. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed on the DAVID database. The binding energy between the key targets of CKI and the active compounds was studied by molecular docking. As a result, 16 active compounds of CKI were identified, corresponding to 285 putative targets. The key targets of CKI for BC are HSD11B1, DPP4, MMP9, CDK1, MMP2, PTGS2, and CA14. The function enrichment analysis obtained 13 GO entries and 6 KEGG pathways, including bladder cancer, cancer pathways, chemical carcinogenesis, estrogen signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. The result of molecular docking indicated that DPP4 had strong binding activity with matrine, alicyclic protein, and sophoridine, and MMP9 had strong binding activity with adenine and sophoridine. In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of CKI on BC is based on the overall pharmacological effect formed by the combined effects of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways. This study provides a theoretical basis for further experimental research in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cervical cancer is one of the top lethal malignancies among women worldwide. The current treatment methods have so many drawbacks that new treatment methods need to be developed. Zhidai Decoction (ZDD) is an effective traditional Chinese herbal formulation for gynecological diseases. Its main effect is controlling abnormal leucorrhea which is a typical early clinical manifestation of cervical cancer. However, how ZDD directly affects cervical cancer has not been addressed. In this study, we established a mouse cervical cancer U14 cell subcutaneous transplantation tumor model and took an early intervention with ZDD to evaluate the antitumor effect of ZDD. In addition, we also investigated the regulatory effects of ZDD on the vaginal microbiota using 16S rRNA analysis in this study. Our results showed that ZDD can significantly improve systemic symptoms and reduce vaginal secretions of tumor-bearing mice. Compared with the CCM group (the cervical cancer model group), in the ZDD-treated group, the tumor inhibitory rate was 37.90%, the average daily food intake of mice was increased to 5.27 ± 0.74 g (P&lt;0.05), and the survival time was obviously prolonged to 21 days (P&lt;0.05). Analysis of the sequencing results of 16S rRNA showed that the main microbial genera of the CCM group were Pasteurella (27.20%) and Helicobacter (18.50%), while those in the ZDD group were Staphylococcus (13.22%) and Lactobacillus (4.68%). It revealed that ZDD has the effect of regulating the vaginal microbiota of cervical cancer, especially in increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus and decreasing the relative abundance of Pasteurella and Helicobacter. The analysis also showed that ZDD could adjust microbiota structure, species abundance, and community compositions of vaginal microbiota. In conclusion, ZDD displayed inhibitory effect on cervical cancer, and it might be based on restoring the balance of vaginal microbiota. Furthermore, our conclusion supports the promotion of ZDD in the early treatment of cervical cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xinxin Li</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jinku Xu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, three kinds of ZnS NPs capping different amount of mercaptoethanol (ME) were synthesized, and the effect of capping amount on ZnS NPs was studied, indicating that the capping amount of ME on ZnS surface decreases, while ZnS size increases as the decrease of added capping agent in synthesis process, and ZnS NP capping middle amount of ME (~27.7 wt%) shows a highest apparent refractive index (RI) value. ZnS NPs were composited into polymeric matrices by a simple “one-step” thermocuring method characterized by adding a small amount of functional monomer of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) The reaction mechanism, studied by 1H NMR spectra, indicates that the epoxy of GMA monomer can be easily opened and chemically grafted on ME-capped ZnS surface under the catalysis of DMF, and then copolymerized with other monomer. By the route, ZnS NPs can be composited into pure poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-type (DMA-type), DMA-type copolymer, and DMA-free matrices to fabricate transparent films, and its RI value can be improved by either optimizing capping amount on ZnS surface or increasing ZnS content in the nanocomposites. The RI value of resulting dried nanocomposites can be improved to 1.764 by compositing 80 wt% ZnS capping middle amount of ME.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. This study reports the use of real-time PCR to identify the SNP rs1545397 in the intron region on the OCA2 gene from ancient and degraded DNA isolated from ancient human bones from Mongolia, Korea, and Uzbekistan. This SNP is a marker for skin pigmentation. LightCycler-based probes (HybProbes) were designed. A LightCycler (version 2.0) system was used for the real-time PCR. Results. The results of the real-time PCRs of three different genotypes of SNP rs1545397 were compared with those of the direct sequencing. Melting curve analysis was used for genotype determination. Three genotypes were distinguished: the homozygous T (T/T) SNP type formed a distinct melting peak at 53.3±0.14°C, the homozygous A (A/A) SNP type formed a distinct melting peak at 57.8±0.12°C, and the heterozygous A/T SNP type formed two distinct melting peaks at 53.3±0.17°C and 57.8±0.15°C. Mongolian aDNA samples tested in this study carried all three types of the SNP (A/T, A/A, and T/T) with no distinctly predominant type observed. In contrast, Korean aDNA samples carried the Asian genotype (T/T), while the Uzbekistan aDNA samples carried the European genotype (A/A) more often than the Asian genotype (T/T). Conclusions. Human Mongolian aDNA samples had A/T, A/A, and T/T SNP rs1545397 with no distinct predominant genotype. When combined with the archeological and aDNA studies of other coupling morphologies with aDNA, our results infer that Mongolia’s prehistoric population had considerable heterogeneity of skin color and morphological traits and that in the Neolithic period, a Eurasian or mixed population inhabited the western part of Mongolia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coloring of graph theory is widely used in different fields like the map coloring, traffic light problems, etc. Hypergraphs are an extension of graph theory where edges contain single or multiple vertices. This study analyzes cluster hypergraphs where cluster vertices too contain simple vertices. Coloring of cluster networks where composite/cluster vertices exist is done using the concept of coloring of cluster hypergraphs. Proper coloring and strong coloring of cluster hypergraphs have been defined. Along with these, local coloring in cluster hypergraphs is also provided. Such a cluster network, COVID19 affected network, is assumed and colored to visualize the affected regions properly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Early diagnosis and positive outcomes of retinoblastoma in childhood have been positively correlated with the economic wealth of high-income countries (HICs) worldwide. Adequate curability and survival rates, adherence to treatment, presence of poor prognostic initial clinical signs, and metastatic disease at diagnosis appear to have a less favorable picture in low-income countries (LICs). However, this is not always the case. An example is Argentina, where disease-free survival rates of retinoblastoma are notably higher than expected when taking into consideration its economic situation. Unfortunately, as in other Latin American LICs, retinoblastoma outcomes in Mexico are worrisome. Interestingly, the Human Development Index (HDI) in Mexico varies widely between its different geographical regions. While in some states, the HDI resembles those of high-income countries, and in others, the opposite is observed. A unifying picture of Mexico’s developmental status, health resources, indicators, and other factors possibly influencing outcomes in retinoblastoma is currently unavailable. The present review explores the previously mentioned factors in Mexico and compares them to other countries. Additionally, it recommends solutions or enhancements where possible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To investigate the effects of Apatinib on the “stemness” of lung cancer cells in vivo and to explore its related mechanisms. Methods. A xenograft model of lung cancer cells A549 was established in nude mice and randomized into a control group (n = 4) and an Apatinib group (n = 4). Tumor tissues were harvested after 2 weeks, and mRNA was extracted to detect changes in stemness-related genes (CD133, EPCAM, CD13, CD90, ALDH1, CD44, CD45, SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4) and Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Hippo signal pathways. Results. Compared with the control group, the volume and weight of nude mice treated with Apatinib were different and had statistical significance. Apatinib inhibited the expressions of ABCG2, CD24, ICAM-1, OCT4, and SOX2 and upregulated the expressions of CD44, CD13, and FOXD3. Apatinib treatment also inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Hippo signaling pathways. Conclusion. Apatinib suppressed the growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cells by repressing the stemness of lung cancer through the inhibition of the Hedgehog, Hippo, and Wnt signaling pathways.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Abel Demerew Hailu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Solomon Ahmed Mohammed</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Adverse drug reactions are major global public health problems and an important cause of mortality. Problems related to medicines safety can emerge from real-life medication use due to increasing access to complex treatment of concomitant infectious and noncommunicable diseases, hence leading to a higher prevalence of drug-related problems. The objective of this review was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of adverse drug reaction reporting among health care professionals in Ethiopia. Relevant literatures were searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Hinari, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct using inclusion and exclusion criteria. From 133 searched studies, 13 studies were reviewed. The knowledge and attitude of health care professionals towards adverse drug reaction reporting ranged from 22.68% -60.33% and 47.22% -67.14%, with averages of 41.50% and 57.18%, respectively. While 46.93% encountered adverse drug reactions and 41.8% reported in the last 12 months. One-third (34.15%) of health care professionals do not know how to report adverse drug reactions. Fearing to report, uncertainty about the adverse drug reaction, concern about reporting generating extra work, thinking that one report does not make any difference, nonavailability of reporting forms, and lack of feedback from regulatory authority were the stated reasons for underreporting. We conclude that the knowledge, attitude, and practice of health care professionals towards spontaneous ADR reporting were low. Conducting awareness and educational training and implementation of electronic reporting can improve the ADR reporting practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The tumor volume of high-grade glioma (HGG) after surgery is usually determined by contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), but the clinical target volume remains controversial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (multimodality MRI) techniques such as magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) can make up for CE-MRI. This study explored the survival outcomes and failure patterns of patients with HGG by comparing the combination of multimodality MRI and CE-MRI imaging with CE-MRI alone. Methods. 102 patients with postoperative HGG between 2012 and 2016 were included. 50 were delineated based on multimodality MRI (PWI, DTI) and CE-MRI (enhanced T1), and the other 52 were delineated based on CE-MRI as control. Results. The median survival benefit was 6 months. The 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local–regional control rates were 48% vs. 25%, 42% vs. 13.46%, and 40% vs. 13.46% for the multimodality MRI and CE-MRI cohorts, respectively. The two cohorts had similar rates of disease progression and recurrence but different proportions of failure patterns. The univariate analysis shows that characteristics of patients such as combined with epilepsy, the dose of radiotherapy, the selection of MRI were significant influence factors for 2-year overall survival. However, in multivariate analyses, only the selection of MRI was an independent significant predictor of overall survival. Conclusions. This study was the first to explore the clinical value of multimodality MRI in the delineation of radiotherapy target volume for HGG. The conclusions of the study have positive reference significance to the combination of multimodality MRI and CE-MRI in guiding the delineation of the radiotherapy target area for HGG patients.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Dan Li</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the development of virtual scenes, the degree of simulation and functions of virtual reality have been very complete, providing a new platform and perspective for teaching design. Firstly, the hidden Markov chain model is used to perform emotion recognition on English speech signals. English speech emotion recognition and speech semantic recognition are essentially the same. Hidden Markov style has been widely used in English speech semantic recognition. The experiments of feature extraction and pattern recognition of speech samples prove that Hidden Markovian has higher recognition rate and better recognition effect in speech emotion recognition. Secondly, combining the human pronunciation model and the hearing model, by analyzing the impact of the glottis feature on the human ear hearing-model feature, the research application of the English speech recognition emotion interactive simulation system uses the glottis feature to compensate the human ear, hearing feature is proposed by compensated English speech recognition, and emotion interaction simulation system is used in the English speech emotion experiment, which has obtained a high recognition rate and showed excellent performance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, the mechanism of cancer research has become hotspots of life science and medicine, especially due to the rapid development of molecular medicine and bioinformatics research. Similarly, the molecular mechanism also has received increasing attention in osteosarcoma (OS) research. Also, a considerable amount of research confirmed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) could regulate cancer cell growth and metastasis. This study aimed to explore the effect of a circRNA, circCCDC66, on OS and reveal its potential molecular mechanism. High circCCDC66 expression level was found in OS patient-derived tissue samples and OS cell lines by qRT-PCR. The abilities cell proliferation and metastatic of U2OS and SW1353 cells were then assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell assay, respectively. The interaction between circCCDC66 and its target miRNAs were verified by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Through functional experiments, we found that circCCDC66 knockdown promoted the inhibition of cell proliferation and metastatic of OS cell lines. From mechanistic perspective, circCCDC66 upregulated PTP1B by sponging miR-338-3p. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that circCCDC66 contributed to malignant behaviors of OS cells by miR-338-3p/PTP1B pathway, which suggested circCCDC66/miR-338-3p/PTP1B axis might be a potential therapeutic target.</dc:description>

<dc:description>AURKA, a cell cycle-regulated kinase, is associated with malignant transformation and progression in many cancer types. We analyzed the expression change of AURKA in pan-cancer and its effect on the prognosis of cancer patients using the TCGA dataset. We revealed that AURKA was extensively elevated and predicted a poor prognosis in most of the detected cancer types, with an exception in colon cancer. AURKA was elevated in colon cancer, but the upregulation of AURKA indicated better outcomes of colon cancer patients. Then we revealed that undermethylation of the AURKA gene and several transcription factors contributed to the upregulation of AURKA in colon cancer. Moreover, we demonstrated that AURKA overexpression promoted the death of colon cancer cells induced by Oxaliplatin, whereas knockdown of AURKA significantly weakened the chemosensitivity of colon cancer cells to Oxaliplatin. Mechanistically, AURKA inhibited DNA damage response by suppressing the expression of various DNA damage repair genes in a TP53-dependent manner, which can partly explain that ARUKA is associated with a beneficial outcome of colon cancer. This study provided a possibility to use AURKA as a biomarker to predict the chemosensitivity of colon cancer to platinum in the clinic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Incarcerated diaphragmatic hernias with intrathoracic perforation of the colon is a very rare but serious surgical emergency. A 78-year-old male patient presented to our emergency department with severe abdominal pain. A computer tomography (CT) scan revealed herniation of the left transverse colon and spleen into the thorax with colon perforation and fecal contents in the thoracic cavity. An emergent laparotomy confirmed the radiological diagnosis and showed a 6 cm dehiscence of the left diaphragm with strangulation of the left transverse colon as well as the spleen. A left-sided hemicolectomy with terminal transversostomy and splenectomy were performed. The diaphragm was closed with interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. We abstained from reinforcement of the suture line with a mesh because of the feculent contamination of the abdominal cavity. After extensive thoracoscopic lavage and insertion of two chest tubes, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Diaphragmatic hernia even after a mild chest trauma can cause fatal complications. Diagnosis and treatment can be challenging and an interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Due to the associated comorbidity and long-lasting sequelae, we believe the awareness of this rare pathology as a differential diagnosis is important; both as an abdominal and thoracic emergency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. This review aims to investigate the efficacy of Tai Chi Chuan on subjective sleep quality among adults. Methods. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and the Wanfang Database from their inception to August 2019 and identified 25 eligible studies that were published in both English and Chinese. Results. 24 out of 25 studies were identified to be high-quality studies according to the PEDro scale. The pooled results confirmed that Tai Chi Chuan elicited moderate improvements in subjective sleep quality (SMD = −0.512, 95% CI [−0.767, −0.257], P&lt;0.001). Notably, Tai Chi Chuan yielded more significant effects on sleep quality among the healthy population (SMD = −0.684, 95% CI [−1.056, −0.311], P&lt;0.001) than the clinical population (SMD = −0.395, 95% CI [−0.742, −0.047], P=0.026) and more benefits among the Asian population (SMD = −0.977, 95% CI [−1.446, −0.508], P&lt;0.001) than the American population (SMD = −0.259, 95% CI [−0.624, 0.105], P=0.164). After controlling the methodological quality of studies, it has been noted that Asians could achieve the most significant sleep-promoting benefit when Tai Chi Chuan was practiced between 60 and 90 min per session. Conclusions. Available data implied that subjective sleep quality was improved via Tai Chi training, but more thorough studies must be executed to ascertain our findings and optimize Tai Chi practices accordingly toward various populations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film battery has high photoelectric conversion efficiency, better spectral dispersion ability, and weak light-adsorption characteristics, as well as shape and size flexibility. CIGS-BIPV (building integrated photovoltaic) has attracted more and more research attention with the advantages of good curvature, form and color diversity, and broad application prospects. This paper uses the classical “Porter’s Five Forces Model” to make a preliminary analysis of the competitiveness of CIGS-BIPV products. A more specific competitiveness analysis model is further built with the index modeling method, and the competitiveness of CIGS-BIPV products is thoroughly analyzed from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Six primary research indicators are used, i.e., safety index, building aesthetics index, economic index, energy-saving and environmental protection index, innovation index, and sales force index. The weight analysis of index modeling shows that compared with a glass curtain wall, exterior stone, and silica-based BIPV, CIGS-BIPV is characterized by high product competitiveness, acceptable cost, attractive appearance, environmental benignity, high technical quality, and certain economic benefits. The product competitiveness of CIGS-BIPV could be further enhanced through the construction and promotion of sales channels.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin or the combination of metformin and 5-FU on the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). For the in vitro experiments, HCT 116 and SW1463 cell lines were treated with metformin or the combination of metformin and 5-FU. Cell proliferation and invasion were analyzed by CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell assay, respectively. For the in vivo experiments, the CRC xenograft nude mice model was used to observe the effects of metformin or combined with 5-FU on tumor growth and metastasis. Metformin significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCT116 and SW1463 cells in vitro, which showed synergetic effects to 5-FU. In CRC xenograft nude mice, metformin alone and metformin combined with 5-FU treatment significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. In summary, metformin played an inhibitory role in the proliferation and metastasis of CRC and had a synergistic effect with 5-FU. Metformin may be a potentially effective anti-metastatic drug or an anticancer adjuvant agent for treating CRC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Microorganisms in the human body play a vital role in metabolism, immune defense, nutrient absorption, cancer control, and prevention of pathogen colonization. More and more biological and clinical studies have shown that the imbalance of microbial communities is closely related to the occurrence and development of various complex human diseases. Finding potential microbial-disease associations is critical for understanding the pathology of a few diseases and thus further improving disease diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we proposed a novel computational model to predict disease-associated microbes. Specifically, we first constructed a heterogeneous interconnection network based on known microbe-disease associations deposited in a few databases, the similarity between diseases, and the similarity between microorganisms. We then predicted novel microbe-disease associations by a new method called the double-ended restart random walk model (DRWHMDA) implemented on the interconnection network. In addition, we performed case studies of colon cancer and asthma for further evaluation. The results indicate that 10 and 9 of the top 10 microorganisms predicted to be associated with colorectal cancer and asthma were validated by relevant literatures, respectively. Our method is expected to be effective in identifying disease-related microorganisms and will help to reveal the relationship between microorganisms and complex human diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Discriminative feature extraction is a challenge for data-driven fault diagnosis. Although deep learning algorithms can automatically learn a good set of features without manual intervention, the lack of domain knowledge greatly limits the performance improvement, especially for nonstationary and nonlinear signals. This paper develops a multiscale information fusion-based stacked sparse autoencoder fault diagnosis method. The autoencoder takes advantage of the multiscale normalized frequency spectrum information obtained by dual-tree complex wavelet transform as input. Accordingly, the multiscale normalized features guarantee the translational invariance for signal characteristics, and the stacked sparse autoencoder benefits the unsupervised feature learning and ensures accurate and stable diagnosis performance. The developed method is performed on motor bearing vibration signals and worm gearbox vibration signals, respectively. The results confirm that the developed method can accommodate changing working conditions, be free of manual feature extraction, and perform better than the existing intelligent diagnosis methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rapid development of interventional procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias in humans, especially the use of catheter ablation techniques, has renewed interest in cardiac anatomy. Although the substrates of atrial fibrillation (AF), its initiation and maintenance, remain to be fully elucidated, catheter ablation in the left atrium (LA) has become a common therapeutic option for patients with this arrhythmia. Using ablation catheters, various isolation lines and focal targets are created, the majority of which are based on gross anatomical, electroanatomical, and myoarchitectual patterns of the left atrial wall. Our aim was therefore to review the gross morphological and architectural features of the LA and their relations to extracardiac structures. The latter have also become relevant because extracardiac complications of AF ablation can occur, due to injuries to the phrenic and vagal plexus nerves, adjacent coronary arteries, or the esophageal wall causing devastating consequences.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, the field monitoring method is used to study the variation of rock mass pressure during the construction of a tunnel in phyllite stratum, and three functions are used to fit and analyze the variation of rock mass pressure with deformation, excavation time, and space. The results show the following (1) When the deformation increases significantly, the rock mass pressure decreases firstly and then increases. This is caused by the insufficient bearing capacity of the rock mass in the arch foot of the supporting structure after the excavation of the upper bench, which leads to a settlement of supporting structure and surrounding rock. (2) Compared with other kinds of fitting functions, the logistic function can better characterize the variation of the pressure of surrounding rock with deformation, excavation time, and distance from the face. This paper provides a reliable reference for the design and construction of the tunnel in phyllite stratum. The logistic function can be used to present and predict the change of rock mass pressure with deformation, excavation time, and space in similar rock mass conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to study the seismic response of the rock slopes with the anchor cable, centrifuge modeling tests were performed on concrete slope models. Different seismic loadings were performed to investigate the horizontal acceleration response, the rock slope displacement, and the stress of anchor cables. The results show that the horizontal acceleration response is obviously amplified by a rock slope. Under the same conditions, the higher the seismic intensity is, the larger the acceleration amplification coefficient will be. Anchor cable can effectively reduce the acceleration amplification effect of the slope. For the slope with a structural plane, the anchor cable at the structural plane is stressed greatly during the seismic action, and the strength of anchor cables near the expected structural plane is important.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to analyze the influence of different nanoadditives on the physical and mechanical properties of similar silty mudstone materials, nano-TiO2 (NTi), nano Al2O3 (NAl), and nanobentonite (NBe) were added to improve the physical and mechanical properties of silty mudstone similar materials. The physical and mechanical parameters are more in line with silty rock. Finally, nanometer additives suitable for silty mudstone similar materials are determined by conducting density test, natural water absorption test, uniaxial compression test, splitting test, softening coefficient test, expansibility test, and microscopic test. The effects of adding NTi, NAl, and NBe on improving the physical and mechanical properties of silty mudstone similar materials were studied to analyze the influence law of different NTi, NAl, and NBe contents on similar material density, natural water absorption, uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, softening coefficient, expansion rate, and other physical and mechanical parameters. The microscopic morphology of similar materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the mechanism of influence of nanoadditives on the microscopic structure of samples was revealed. The results are as follows. (1) The density of similar materials of silty mudstone increases with the increase of the content of nanoadditive. The natural water absorption rate decreased first and then increased with the increase of the content of nanometer additives, while the softening coefficient decreased with the increase of the content of nanometer additives. The uniaxial compressive strength and tensile strength increased first and then decreased with the increase of the content of nanometer additives. This is due to the incorporation of the nanoadditive amount effective to promote the hydration reaction of gypsum and accelerate the production of cement, while a similar material may be filled in the pores, reducing the internal defects, a similar material to make denser; when excessive dosage, nanoadditives agglomeration occurs, resulting in deterioration of the effect, but will reduce the mechanical properties of similar materials. (2) When the content of NBe is 6%, the physical and mechanical parameters of similar materials can reach or be closer to the silty raw rock except uniaxial compressive strength. The failure mode of the uniaxial compression specimen is also the same as that of the original rock, which can be used as the best choice. The research results laid the foundation for further analysis of NBe application in similar materials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The microscopic pore development of most coal seams in China leads to different permeability of coal seams and different gas drainage efficiency. Representative three coal rank coal samples were selected for saturation-centrifugation observation. The microscopic pore characteristics of coal samples were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid nitrogen adsorption methods. The experimental results showed that the coal samples were subjected to saturation-centrifugation and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests. It was found that the pores of the low-rank coal (XJ-1, XJ-2) were developed at various stages, and the connectivity between the pores was good and the permeability was also good. The adsorption pores of the intermediate coal (HB-1, HB-2) and high-rank coal (ZM-1, ZM-2) were relatively developed, and the connectivity between the pores was slightly poor. The parallel coal seam samples of coals of different ranks were better than the vertical bedding. The adsorption of liquid nitrogen showed that the low-order coal had more open pores and good gas permeability; the high-order coal had more openings at one end, more ink bottles, and narrow holes, and the gas permeability was not good. Studying the micropore structure and permeability of coals of different ranks has guiding significance for mastering the law of coal seam gas storage and transportation, extracting drilling arrangements, and increasing gas drainage and reducing greenhouse effect.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The increased use of fertilizers from phosphates in agriculture generates water pollution by heavy metals contained in these phosphates at levels higher than the standards. In our study, we used a cadmium nitrate Cd(NO3)2 solution to simulate artificially polluted water, whose decontamination efficiency will be evaluated by an electrocoagulation/flotation process. During this work, we aimed to optimize the electrocoagulation process according to the following factors: initial pH of the solution, density of the electrolysis current, cell time, and nature of the supporting electrolyte and its concentration. The criteria adopted during the optimization of the process are relatively different from those used in similar studies. Indeed, we have tried to achieve maximum efficiency and also seeking to minimize costs and facilitate implementation. We achieved a 98% Cd removal efficiency from the solution at pH = 7, J = 6.25 A/m2, t = 10 min, and [K2SO4] = 0.01 M. In addition, during the characterization of the flocs obtained as a supernatant, we first highlighted the presence of Cd in this gelatinous body and then the relatively easy volatility of Cd as well as that of aluminum oxide (Al2O3).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Glycosaminoglycan plays an important role in the maintenance of glomerular charge selectivity of diabetic nephropathy. Sulodexide, a mixture of naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide components, has shown a nephroprotective effect in an experimental model of diabetic nephropathy. Although sulodexide reduced albuminuria in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, long-term effects in patients with type 2 diabetes with significant proteinuria have not been established. Objectives. The study was aimed at investigating the effects of sulodexide on proteinuria and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Methods. Fifty-two patients with proteinuria between 500 and 3000 mg/day received sulodexide 200 mg/day for 12 months, while 56 matched patients with type 2 diabetes constituted the control group. All patients received standard metabolic and blood pressure controls. Primary outcome was evaluated as percentage of reduced proteinuria compared with the control group. Renal function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Results. Proteinuria significantly increased in the control group [0.9 (IQR 0.3 to 1.78) to 1.16 (IQR 0.44 to 2.23) g/gCr, P=0.001], whereas it remained stable in the sulodexide group [0.66 (IQR 0.23 to 0.67) to 0.67 (IQR 0.17 to 1.51) g/gCr, P=0.108]. At 12 months, proteinuria was higher by 19.4% (IQR 10.3 to 37.6) in the control group while proteinuria was lower by -17.7% (IQR -53.1 to 3.2) in the sulodexide group with a significant difference between groups (P=0.001). Renal function was noted as a change of estimated GFR, and serum creatinine decreased significantly during the study in both groups but did not significantly differ between groups. No significant changes in the blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A1C were reported. Conclusion. In addition to standard treatment, sulodexide is efficient in maintaining proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes with nonnephrotic range proteinuria, but it did not provide an additional benefit concerning renal disease progression.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Fengliang Wu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhisheng Li</dc:creator>
<dc:description>To investigate the effect of structural parameters on the performance of an annular slot ejector, a series of numerical simulations were conducted with single-factor analysis. Moreover, a multifactor grey relational analysis was applied to examine the correlations between the structural parameters and entrainment ratio. Subsequently, the optimised model was verified by comparing the simulated results with experimental data. Results show that the performance of the optimised ejector model was improved. The RNG k-ε turbulent transport mode can simulate the internal field characteristics of an annular slot ejector, and the corresponding simulated results, as verified by experiment, satisfy engineering requirements. In addition, a quantitative correlation between structural parameters and entrainment ratio was obtained as follows: e (nozzle clearance) &gt; θ (diffusing chamber angle) &gt; HL (mixing chamber length) &gt; d (throat diameter) &gt; KL (diffusing chamber length). This work may provide a certain guiding significance for the design and application of annular slot ejectors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chryseobacterium gleum is a lactose nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) found in soil, plants, and some water sources but rarely implicated as a human pathogen. Its scarcity in the medical literature and resistance to numerous broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems, cephalosporins, and beta-lactam/lactamase inhibitors pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present the first reported case, to the best of our knowledge, of sepsis from central line-associated blood stream infection from Chryseobacterium gleum in the United States.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected 210 countries and territories around the world. The virus has spread rapidly, and the disease is still extending up to now. The pathophysiology for SARS-CoV-2 has not been well elucidated, and diverse hypotheses to date have been proposed. Initially, no skin manifestations were observed among patients with COVID-19, but recently a few cases have been described. In this review, we discuss these various cutaneous manifestations and skin problems related to personal protective equipment, as well as different cutaneous anti-COVID-19 drug-associated reactions. We also focus on the currently proposed managements of these rare manifestations.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Wei Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ying Fan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper proposes a matching degree to study dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of urban taxi and offers a novel understanding of self-organization taxi dispatch in hotspots on top of the Fermi learning model. The proposed matching degree can not only reflect the overall spatiotemporal characteristics of urban taxi supply and demand but also show that the density of distribution and the distance between the taxis supply and the city center will affect the satisfaction of demand. Besides, it is interesting to note that supply always exceeds demand and they will self-organize into an equilibrium state in hotspots. To understand the phenomenon, we develop the Fermi learning model based on the prospect theory and compared the results with the popular reinforcement learning model. The results demonstrate that both models can account for self-organization behavior under different scenarios. We believe our work is crucial to explore taxis data and our indicator can provide a significant suggestion for urban taxis development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Verifiable secret sharing (VSS) is one of the basic problems in the theory of distributed cryptography and has an important role in secure multiparty computation. In this case, it is tried to share a confidential data as secret, between multiple nodes in a distributed system, in the presence of an active adversary that can destroy some nodes, such that the secret can be reconstructed with the participation of certain size of honest nodes. A dynamic adversary can change its corrupted nodes among the protocol. So far, there is not a formal definition and there are no protocols of dynamic adversaries in VSS context. Also, another important question is, would there exist a protocol to share a secret with a static adversary with at most 1 broadcast round? In this paper, we provide a formal definition of the dynamic adversary. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed protocol in terms of the runtime, the memory usage, and the number of message exchanges. We show that the change period of the dynamic adversary could not happen in less than 4 rounds in order to have a perfectly secure VSS, and then we establish a protocol to deal with this type of adversary. Also, we prove that the lower bound of broadcast complexity for the static adversary is (2,0)-broadcast rounds.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Weiguo Yang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, a multilayer recurrence network is introduced to examine the information linkage between carbon and energy markets. We first construct a multilayer recurrence network of energy and carbon markets, and we define the information linkage coefficient to measure the linkage relationship between the network layers based on the network microstructure. To measure the mutual leading relationship between carbon and energy markets, we construct a time-delay multilayer recurrence network and introduce the time-delay information linkage coefficient to measure the intersystem interaction. The carbon and energy prices, including West Texas Intermediate crude oil, coal, natural gas, and gasoline, from February 22, 2011, to April 1, 2019, are selected as sample data for empirical analysis. The results show that the linkage relationship between oil, coal, natural gas, and carbon prices presents a U-shaped trend in the second, transitional, and third phases of the European Union carbon market, while the linkage trend of gasoline and carbon prices continues to rise. The mutual leading relationship between energy and carbon prices changes in different stages, and carbon price plays a leading role at the present stage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Robotic intravenous poles are automated supportive instrument that needs to be triggered by patients to hold medications and needed supplies. Healthcare engineering of robotic intravenous poles is advancing in order to improve the quality of health services to patients worldwide. Existing intravenous poles in the market were supportive to patients, yet they constrained their movement, consumed the time of both the patient and the nurse, and they were expensive in regard to what they offer. Although robotic poles overcame some of the movement limitations of the commercial/market poles, they were partially automated and did not offer additional technological features. The aim of our work was to develop a fully automated Biomedical Intravenous Pole Robot (BMIVPOT) to resolve the aforementioned limitations and to offer new technological features to intravenous poles, thereby promoting the health services. Several sensors and build-up materials were empirically chosen to be cost-effective and fulfill our needs. The new prototype was divided into three steps: simulated prototype, real implementation of the prototype, and testing and evaluation. Simulation results showed the best qualitative way to fit all the specifications in the robotic system, such as the shape, sensors, and connections in order to provide the proper functionality of the system. Experimental and real results provided the manufactured parts, implemented sensors, and the final robot. Testing the tracking and the flow sensor performances were provided. Evaluation of our Biomedical Intravenous Pole Robot with alternatives showed that our robot outperforms the other poles in many aspects including the features it offers, the percentage of interventions it comprised, the reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The overall percentage of features offered by our Biomedical Intravenous Pole Robot was 60% higher than that offered by peer research poles and 80% higher than that of the market poles. In addition, the average percentage of integration of interventions (architecture, sensor, wireless, tracking, and mechanical) in the Biomedical Intravenous Pole Robot was at least 56% higher than that of the alternative poles. According to the results, Biomedical Intravenous Pole Robot offers a cost-effective price as compared to the others. As a future prospect, we intend to add more features to this prototype in order to enhance it, such as vital signs detection, and improve the tracking system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wireless signal-transmitting process is a complex procedure, to improve the indoor positioning accuracy, and this work proposes a novel indoor positioning technique based on receiving signal’s strength. First, the indoor environment of the building is regionalized in the training phase of indoor positioning. Then, the adjacent points of the indoor space with the same wireless signal transmission characteristics are gathered into the same area, and the corresponding parameter sets and decision domains of each area are constructed. After that, during the positioning stage, the regional confidence and receiving signal’s strength are used to predict the indoor area where the mobile station is located. Finally, the ranging and solution results of the traditional three-sided positioning process are constrained to obtain the optimal solution. Comparing with the traditional positioning techniques that regard the entire complex indoor environment as an entirety, the proposed indoor space regionalization preprocessing method can effectively reduce the ranging error. Compared with the indiscriminate data fusion of the centroid method, the data filtering method based on regional confidence is more targeted. In the experiment, a practical office area is used to test our proposal’s performance, and the experimental results show that our approach can effectively improve the accuracy of indoor positioning results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. While completion of the Child Welfare Clinic (CWC) schedule for children remains a crucial factor in the prevention of illness and promotion of better child health, there has been low attendance among caregivers in Ghana. This study examined knowledge of 220 caregivers of children aged 24–59 months on CWC and other factors influencing attendance in the Garu-Tempane District of Northern Ghana. Methods. This health facility-based descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among caregivers of children using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics comprising frequency, percentage, Fisher’s exact test, and logistic regression were adopted in analysing the data. Results. Less than half (46.9%) of the children completed their CWC schedules. Meanwhile, caregivers’ knowledge on CWC was 97.7%. Children aged 37–48 months (AOR = 0.42, 95%CI = 0.21–0.86, p=0.017) and 49–59 months (AOR = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.10–0.77, p=0.014), respectively, had lower odds of completing CWC. Children with caregivers not having any formal education also had lower odds of completing CWC (AOR = 0.45, 95%CI = 0.21–0.95, p=0.036). Conclusion. Educational programmes on the importance of CWC completion should focus on caregivers with children aged 37 months and above and those caregivers with low educational level. It is further recommended that studies be conducted to explore the extent of association between caregivers’ marital status, occupation, level of knowledge, and child CWC completion in the Garu-Tempane District.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zhenya Wu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jianping Hao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prior distribution elicitation is a challenging problem for a Bayesian inference-based mean time to repair (MTTR) demonstration because if inaccurate prior information is introduced into the prior distribution, the results become unreliable. This paper proposes a novel maintenance task representation model based on the similarity of attributed maintenance items. A novel similarity computation algorithm for maintenance tasks is then formulated on the basis of this model. Optimistic and pessimistic values are ascertained from the time data for similar maintenance tasks to obtain a prior distribution. The main idea is to separate maintenance tasks into distinct items and use attribute sets to extract key features. Each pair of items is then compared to quantify the differences between reference and candidate tasks. Candidate tasks with an acceptable difference from the reference task are taken as prior information sources for constructing the prior distribution. A case study involving a high-frequency (HF) transceiver MTTR Bayesian demonstration shows that the proposed method can effectively obtain maintenance tasks similar to those of information sources for prior distribution elicitation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the multistep attack scenario, each rational attack-defense player tries to maximize his payoff, but the uncertainty about his adversary prevents him from taking the favorable actions. How to select the best strategy from the candidate strategies to maximize the defense payoff becomes the core issue. For this purpose, the paper innovatively designs a game theory model from the point of network survivability in combination with the attribute attack graph. The attack graph is created based on the network connectivity and known vulnerabilities using the MulVAL toolkit, which gives the full view of all the known vulnerabilities and their interdependence. Then, we use the attack graph to extract attack-defense actions, candidate attack-defense strategies, attack-defense payoffs, and network states, as well as other game modeling elements. Afterwards, the payoffs of attack-defense strategies are quantified by integrating attack-defense strength and network survivability. In addition, we input the above elements into the game model. Through repeated learning, deduction, and improvement, we can optimize the layout of defense strategies. Finally, the efficient strategy selection approach is designed on the tradeoff between defense cost and benefit. The simulation of attack-defense confrontation in small-scale LAN shows that the proposed approach is reliable and effective.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yu Tang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hui Qin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Real-time substructure testing (RST) algorithm is a newly developed integration method for real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) which has structure-dependent and explicit formulations for both displacement and velocity. The most favourable characteristics of the RST algorithm is unconditionally stable for linear and no iterations are needed. In order to fully evaluate the performance of the RST method in solving dynamic problems for nonlinear systems, stability, numerical dispersion, energy dissipation, and overshooting properties are discussed. Stability analysis shows that the RST method is only conditionally stable when applied to nonlinear systems. The upper stability limit increases for stiffness-softening systems with an increasing value of the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity while decreases for stiffness-hardening systems when the instantaneous degree of nonlinearity becomes larger. Meanwhile, the initial damping ratio of the system has a negative impact on the upper stability limit especially for instantaneous stiffness softening systems, and a larger value of the damping ratio will significantly decrease the upper stability limit of the RST method. It is shown in the accuracy analysis that the RST method has relatively smaller period errors and numerical damping ratios for nonlinear systems when compared with other two well-developed algorithms. Three simplified engineering cases are presented to investigate the dynamic performance of the RST method, and the numerical results indicate that this method has a more desirable accuracy than other methods in solving dynamic problems for both linear and nonliner systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rock mechanical properties under the effect of high temperature present a great significance on underground rock engineering. In this paper, the mechanical properties of sandstones, marbles, and granites under real-time heating were investigated with a servo-controlled compression apparatus. The results show that mechanical behaviours of all the three types of rocks are influenced by real-time heating to different degrees. Due to thermal cracking, the uniaxial compressive strengths decrease as the heating temperature rises from room temperature to 400°C. Above 400°C, the sandstone exhibits a significant increase in UCS because of the sintering reaction. The sintering enlarges the contact area and friction between crystal grains in the sandstone, which strengthens the bearing capacity. For marbles, the UCS continues to decrease from 400°C to 600°C due to thermal cracking. However, the carbonate in the marble begins to decompose after 600°C. The generated particles would fill the cracks in the marble and increase the strength. For granites, their UCS presents a sharp decline after 400°C because of thermal cracking. For all rock elastic modulus, they present a decreasing trend, and this indicates that the rock’s ability to resist deformation gradually weakens under the effect of temperature. In general, rock mechanical behaviours under real-time heating differ from those in normal situations, and use of the parameters presented here is important for underground rock engineering related to high temperature and can improve the precision in theoretical and numerical analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although pulmonary fibrosis can occur in the absence of a clear-cut inciting agent, and without a clinically clear initial acute inflammatory phase, it is more commonly associated with severe lung injury. This may be due to respiratory infections, chronic granulomatous diseases, medications, and connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction. Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the evidence in support of the putative risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis in the disease and propose risk mitigation strategies. We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism. With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Critical care medicine is a branch of medical science that deals with the characteristics and regularity of life-threatening processes initiated by any injury or disease and, accordingly, relevant treatment for patients with critical illness. Conceptions of critical care medicine in China stemmed in the early 1970s. Ever since the establishment of the first intensive care unit (ICU) along with the increasingly incomparable role of ICU in medical practices, critical care medicine has become an indispensable part of the Chinese medical and health system. Currently, critical care medicine as a secondary clinical discipline and a well-constructed science is in sustainable development on the way towards systematization and standardization. Methods. The gross domestic product (GDP) and population data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. The number of ICUs, ICU beds, and hospital beds and other data regarding ICU staffing and facility resources were obtained from the Yearbook of Health in the People’s Republic of China and National Bureau of Statistics. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 and the number of health workers aiding Hubei amid COVID-19 pandemic were obtained from the National Health Commission. Findings. Critical care medicine in mainland China has made significant strides: both quantity and quality are progressing at a fast pace after SARS in 2003. Although there exist some disparities in healthcare personnel and medical resources, they have not hindered the country from mobilizing its healthcare workers and resources against a public health emergency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stress is regulated by the autonomous nervous system, increasing the sympathetic modulation when a threat is perceived. A multifactorial response usually leads to significant behavioural modifications and alterations on homeostasis and physical and psychological status. Moreover, stress is an emotional response that can lead to psychosocial and psychophysiological adversity. Regarding military population, military operations and combat exposure are important stressors that influence acute and chronic stress response in soldiers, affecting their performance and health. A bibliographic search was carried out between April and May 2019, focusing on recent studies (2013–2019) that analysed psychophysiological response, stress, stress regulation, heart rate, heart rate variability, and posttraumatic stress disorder in military population. Autonomic and cardiovascular chronic stress seems to be modulated by experience and previous specific training of each military unit. Physical exercise, music embedded with binaural beat technology, bidirectional sensory motor rhythm training, heart rate variability biofeedback, and transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation are the main techniques applied to balance stress and to recover body homeostasis. Since military population are usually exposed to multiple stressors, knowing previous training and experience, together with developing techniques to balance stress, is the main practical application in this field of study to balance autonomic and cardiovascular systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A bipolar clavicle separation is defined as a simultaneous dislocation of the ipsilateral sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) and acromioclavicular joint (ACJ). This rare injury pattern is usually the result of a high-energy mechanism, such as a motor vehicle collision or fall from height. While there are several treatment options such as screw fixation, sutures, or plate fixations, there is no single standard approach for this infrequent injury. We describe a unique case of bipolar clavicle dislocation, specifically an anteriorly displaced SCJ and posteriorly displaced ACJ, treated with a novel surgical technique—a TightRope technique (Arthex®) and semitendinosus allograft.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has high global prevalence; however, the treatments of NAFLD are limited due to lack of approved drugs. Methods. Mice were randomly assigned into three groups: Control group, NAFLD group, NAFLD plus Si-Wu-Tang group. A NAFLD mice model was established by feeding with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for four weeks. Si-Wu-Tang was given orally by gastric gavage at the beginning of 3rd week, and it lasted for two weeks. The treatment effects of Si-Wu-Tang were confirmed by examining the change of body weight, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, Oil Red O staining, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the liver samples and accompanied by steatosis grade scores. The expression and activation of the possible signaling proteins involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD were determined by western blotting. Results. Mice fed with four weeks of MCD diet displayed elevated serum levels of ALT and AST, while there was decreased body weight. The hepatic Oil Red O staining and H&amp;E staining showed severe liver steatosis with high steatosis grade scores. All these can be improved by treating with Si-Wu-Tang for two weeks. Mechanistically, the increased hepatic TLR4 expression and its downstream JNK phosphorylation induced by MCD diet were suppressed by Si-Wu-Tang. Moreover, the upregulations of Caspase-8, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and cleaved-GSDMD in liver mediated by MCD diet were all inhibited by Si-Wu-Tang. Conclusions. Treatment with Si-Wu-Tang improves MCD diet-induced NAFLD in part via blocking TLR4-JNK and Caspase-8-GSDMD signaling pathways, suggesting that Si-Wu-Tang has potential for clinical application in treating NAFLD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The present study highlighted the value of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) for different types of corneal foreign bodies in humans. Methods. This study was a prospective observational study. The patients included were divided into two groups. If the patients were directly diagnosed based on eye injury history and slit-lamp examination, then they were assigned to Group A. Otherwise, the patients were assigned to Group B. We compared and described the characteristics of the corneal foreign body in both groups using AS-OCT. Results. From October 2017 to January 2020, 36 eyes of 36 patients (9 females and 27 males) with a mean age of 37.8 ± 11.7 years were included in the study. Patients in Group A were the majority and accounted for 72.2% (26/36). High signals on AS-OCT images were the main constituent and accounted for 92.3% (24/26) in Group A and 70.0% (7/10) in Group B. Most of the patients in Group A, 96.2% (25/26), had clear boundaries. A blurred boundary was observed in 70.0% (7/10) of the patients in Group B. The foreign bodies on AS-OCT images had key characteristics of a high signal followed by a central zone shadowing effect and a low signal followed by a marginal zone shadowing effect. Further, all of the lesions could be directly located in Group B, and 92.3% (24/26) of the patients in Group A did not have directly located lesions. Six representative cases are described in detail. Conclusions. AS-OCT is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of corneal foreign bodies, especially for unusual corneal foreign body.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Riccardo C. Storti</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A derivation of Cosmological Age explicitly constrained by Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is presented, demonstrating that the correct value of Cosmological Age is equal to the Hubble Age. It is shown that utilizing “z = 0” for Cosmological Redshift in the Present Epoch introduces a fundamental flaw into Cosmological Age calculations. However, this flaw is captured and corrected by the Polarizable-Vacuum (PV) Model of Gravity developed by Puthoff, suggesting that the Dark Energy Field exists as a massive photonic field. Consequently, it is demonstrated that for a Dark Energy Driven description of Accelerated Cosmological Expansion, Cosmological Redshift takes a negative value in the Present Epoch.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Attempts to predict the likelihood of positive morphological imaging related with PSA value in patients referred with biochemical recurrence were the focus of many studies. Using nuclear medicine modalities, numerous studies likewise had been performed for the same purpose, however mostly using C-11-labeled choline. For this purpose, we selected 193 prostate cancer patients from our database between 2006 and 2010. They had been referred to our department to undergo 18F-fluorethylcholine (FECH)-PET/CT due to biochemical recurrence after potentially curative procedures. As a result, in 84 out of 193 patients, 18F-FECH-PET demonstrated positive findings with an overall detection rate of 44%. Statistically, there was a significant difference in PSA values in positive findings vs. negative findings (p&lt;0.001), and there was a linear correlation between the detection rate and PSA value (r = 0.91). Moreover, there was a relation between initial therapy and recurrence type. So, the local relapse was the most frequent recurrence (&gt;70%) after radiation therapy alone. By contrast, patients after radical prostatectomy followed by salvage radiotherapy showed a low likelihood of local recurrence. In conclusion, PSA value was confirmed to have a determinant role in 18F-FECH-PET outcome. Moreover, there was a link between recurrence type and initial therapy, which—if prospectively confirmed—may play a guiding role in selecting the appropriate diagnostic methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The level hydrolysis of myelin basic protein (MBP) by IgG in patients with schizophrenia was studied depending on the clinical features and course of the disease. The patients were grouped according to type of schizophrenia and type of disease course. We found that IgGs isolated and purified from sera of schizophrenia patients’ blood hydrolyses human MBP, and the level of this hydrolysis significantly exceeds that of healthy individuals. Detection of protease activity corresponding only to intact IgGs in polyacrylamide gel fragments, together with data of gel filtration of antibodies under conditions of “acid shock” (concordance of optical density profile of IgG with profile of MBP-hydrolyzing activity) and with the absence of any other proteins and bands in gradient SDS-PAGE and in PVDF membrane provides direct evidence that the IgGs from the schizophrenia patients have MBP-hydrolyzing activity. The antibodies-specific proteolytic activity of patients with acute schizophrenia (1.026 [0.205; 3.372] mg MBP/mg IgG/h) significantly exceeds the activity of IgG in patients in remission (0.656 [0.279; 0.873] mg MBP/mg IgG/h) and in healthy individuals (0.000 [0.00; 0.367] mg MBP/mg IgG/h). When comparing the specific activity in patients with different types of disease course, we have found that patients with a continuous course of paranoid schizophrenia (1.810 [0.746; 4.101 mg MBP/mg IgG/h]) had maximal activity values. It can be assumed that the increase in the activity of MBP-hydrolyzing antibodies is due to the activation of humoral immunity in acute schizophrenia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Isoniazid, the choice antitubercular agent, has only been employed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study evaluated if the enzyme-mimetic activities of magnetic nanoparticles could accelerate the activation process of isoniazid against mycobacterial and, more importantly, non-mycobacterial microorganisms. First, magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized and coated by lipoamino acid; then, isoniazid was conjugated to synthesized nanoparticles. Antibacterial activities of nanoconjugated isoniazid were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and four Gram-positive and Gram-negative nonmycobacterial strains through a microdilution broth process. Results showed that the required amount of isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis would decrease to 44.8% and 16.7% in conjugation with naked and surface-modified magnetic nanoparticles, respectively. Also, 32 μg/mL and 38 μg/mL of isoniazid in conjugation with naked and surface-modified nanoparticles, respectively, could prevent the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Hence, the vicinity of magnetic nanoparticles with isoniazid could declare promising aspects of isoniazid antibacterial capabilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. More than 90% of human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) infected patients show at least one mucocutaneous manifestation during the course of their disease. The frequency, pattern, and associated factors of these complications vary among different populations. Objective. This study was planned to evaluate the frequency of cutaneous presentations in HIV-infected patients and their association with the count of CD4 cells. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted on eighty-four HIV-positive patients, who attended the Behavior Consultation Center of Arak University of Medical Sciences. All subjects had a complete physical examination by an expert dermatologist. Further diagnostic procedures were performed, if necessary. Counts of CD4 were determined using flow cytometry. Results. From 84 patients who enrolled in this study, 95.2% manifested at least one type of mucocutaneous lesions. The most common presentation was xerosis, followed by seborrheic dermatitis, herpes simplex, and oral candidiasis. Oral candidiasis and furuncle were significantly associated with decrease in CD4 cell counts. Conclusions. Cutaneous manifestations are common in HIV-positive patients, some of which (oral candidiasis and furuncle) could be applicable as useful clinical indicators to predict the immune status of the patients. Therefore, regular skin examinations are recommended as routine HIV-infected patients’ healthcare programs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes some results concerning the interaction of living matter of different organization levels (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) with the flux of thermal neutrons. The phenomenon of the virtual neutron trap was tested during the passage of thermalized neutrons from the Pu-Be couple through a flat layer of E. coli suspension. We have studied the metabolic characteristics of A. salina cysts before and after artificial neutron flux exposure. It has been demonstrated that the concentrations of some metals in samples of alive and dead cysts irradiated with an artificial flow of thermal neutrons are not equal. The content of Mn in alive A. salina samples has increased more than ten-fold after their interaction with neutron flux, while the amount of As decreased by a factor of two after exposure. Levels of other elements (Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, and Pb) did not show any significant difference. Trace element composition of cysts was assessed using the method of atomic absorption spectroscopy with electrothermal atomization and the Zeeman background correction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. It is unknown whether the presence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in umbilical cord blood denotes activation of complement and oxidative stress to affect the duration of pregnancy and birth weight. Methods. In a cross-sectional study conducted from January to April 2019 in Bamenda, Cameroon, cord blood samples were collected from 300 women at delivery. Parasitaemia was determined microscopically. Babies’ weight and age of gestation were recorded. Plasma levels of complement and oxidative stress were measured by specific tests. Results. Cord blood malaria prevalence was 21.33%. Babies with an infected cord showed a low birth weight and gestation age than those with uninfected cords. More babies with infected cords had LBW (6.25%) compared to the counterparts (5.50%). The levels of parasitaemia and the babies’ weight showed a weak positive correlation. The prevalence of preterm and postterm birth was 4.33% and 24.33% respectively, with a weak negative correlation between the age of gestation and the umbilical cord parasitaemia. There was correlation between cord parasitaemia and levels of complement haemolytic activity titter (CH50) and specific classical pathway activity (CPA) in cord blood. CH50 and CPA levels, however, were significantly higher in infected cord blood samples, compared with uninfected cord blood samples. CH50 showed a negative correlation with the birth weight and gestational age in infected cord blood samples. The levels of total oxidative stress (TOS) and total antioxidant defense were significantly lower in infected cord blood than uninfected. TOS displayed a positive correlation with the density of parasitaemia and a weak negative correlation with the birth weight and gestational age in infected cord blood. Conclusion. Cord blood infection lowers the complement haemolytic titter, oxygen radicals and total antioxidant defense in neonates. This lowering of complement haemolytic titter and oxygen radical compounds in umbilical cord malaria are associated with low birth weight and preterm birth.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xiaoyan Peng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate analog widely used against a range of diseases including malignancies and autoimmune disorders. Its high effectiveness-price ratio also won extensive application in ophthalmology. On the other hand, although MTX has an excellent pharmacological efficacy, MTX associated side effects in clinical use, which vary from patient to patient, are nonnegligible. There is no comparatively systematic review on MTX associated side effects and its risk factors. This review aimed to reveal novel clinical approaches of MTX and its adverse effects in order to provide a reference for ophthalmic scholars in clinical application of MTX.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a case history of observed performance of highway embankment over soft marine clay in Wenzhou, China. During the embankment construction, the changes of ground settlement, ground displacement, and lateral displacement of subsoil with the construction time were monitored and analyzed. The monitoring results indicate that the ground settlement and lateral displacement of subsoil account for about 75% in the process of embankment construction. The measured maximum values of ground settlement, ground displacement, and lateral displacement of subsoil are 37.88 mm, 21.50 mm, and 23.56 mm, respectively. After the completion of the embankment construction, the settlement gradually tended to be stable. It is suggested that the monitoring data of settlement and displacement of embankment are smaller than the design requirements, and the embankment stability is also ensured.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Phloretin is a flavonoid existed in various plants and has been reported to possess anticarcinogenic activity. However, the anticancer mechanism of phloretin in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Here, our in vitro and in vivo experimental data demonstrate that phloretin inhibits the phosphorylation and the activation of EGFR and then inhibits its downstream PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in PCa cells. Inhibition of these two pathways further decreases expression of Sp1 by inhibiting Sp1 gene transcription, induces degradation of Sp1 protein by inhibiting GSK3β phosphorylation, suppresses nucleolin-enhanced translation of Sp1 mRNA by inhibiting nucleolin phosphorylation, and directly inactivates transcription activity of Sp1. Inhibition of Sp1 subsequently decreases the expression of Sp3/4, VEGF, and Survivin and then upregulates apoptosis-related proteins and downregulates cell cycle-related proteins in PCa cells. Finally, phloretin treatment in PCa cells induces cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, suggesting that phloretin may be an effective therapy compound in the treatment of prostate cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Fulminant necrotising amoebic colitis (FulNAC) is an uncommon and grave complication of a very common infectious disease widely prevalent in tropical countries. In most of the cases reported, only a segment of large bowel was gangrenous. The involvement of the whole of the large bowel, as in our case, is very rare and has very high mortality ranging from 55% to 100%. Case Summary. A 50-year-old gentleman presented with an acute abdomen with a history of crampy abdominal pain and passage of blood mixed with mucous and loose stools. After resuscitation and investigations, the patient was taken up for laparotomy and the findings showed that the caecum was sloughed off and the entire large bowel had multiple perforations. Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed evidence of pancolitis with multiple colonies of amoebic trophozoites. Discussion. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoon that affects the large intestine and liver in humans. There can be various presentations of amoebiasis: asymptomatic infection (90%), symptomatic noninvasive infection (6–8%), acute amoebic colitis (dysentery), or fulminant colitis with perforation. FulNAC is an uncommon complication, difficult to diagnose and treat, and associated with a high mortality rate, ranging from 55% to 100%. Conclusion. It is important to consider the possibility of fulminant necrotising amoebic colitis (FulNAC) as an uncommon and fatal complication of amoebiasis, especially in tropical countries, where amoebiasis is prevalent. Early diagnosis and antiamoebic treatment, along with urgent aggressive surgical resection of the involved segment and exteriorization of the proximal and distal bowel ends, are shown to reduce mortality.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jana Krykorkova</dc:creator>
<dc:description>General conditions and requirements for an internal standard useful in the determination of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) by the method of gas chromatography coupled with mass detection (GC/MS) were defined. The determination is based on a GC/MS analysis of a mixture of a CWA with an internal standard, conversion of the TIC chromatogram to a chromatogram extracted at a particular m/z ratio, and calculation of the CWA concentration from the internal standard concentration, response factor, and chromatographic peak areas. Available internal standards were identified, and they were verified for seven organophosphorus nerve-paralysing agents. Corresponding response factors were determined as a ratio of gradients of the linear functions of the peak area and compound concentration. Linearity, repeatability, and accuracy of the measurements were evaluated. The determination can be performed on all GC/MS systems of the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic (FRS), where no CWA standards are available.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examined the postoperative pain management practices among registered nurses in an urban hospital in Vietnam. Data of 90 nurses about postoperative pain management practices and pain management at the department were collected. Results indicated that 83.3% of nurses reported that they regularly assessed the degree of pain for postoperative patients. Only 32.2% used assessment tools such as the numeric rating scale to measure pain. Experience in pain management and having guidelines in the department were associated with a higher score in pain management practice. Findings suggested that facilitating the use of pain instruments and developing pain management guidelines should be prioritized.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The current study examined gender-related differences in hemispheric asymmetries of graph metrics, calculated from a cortical thickness-based brain structural covariance network named hemispheric morphological network. Methods. Using the T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 285 participants (150 females, 135 males) retrieved from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), hemispheric morphological networks were constructed per participant. In these hemispheric morphologic networks, the degree of similarity between two different brain regions in terms of the distributed patterns of cortical thickness values (the Jensen–Shannon divergence) was defined as weight of network edge that connects two different brain regions. After the calculation and summation of global and local graph metrics (across the network sparsity levels K=0.10‐0.36), asymmetry indexes of these graph metrics were derived. Results. Hemispheric morphological networks satisfied small-worldness and global efficiency for the network sparsity ranges of K=0.10–0.36. Between-group comparisons (female versus male) of asymmetry indexes revealed opposite directionality of asymmetries (leftward versus rightward) for global metrics of normalized clustering coefficient, normalized characteristic path length, and global efficiency (all p&lt;0.05). For the local graph metrics, larger rightward asymmetries of cingulate-superior parietal gyri for nodal efficiency in male compared to female, larger leftward asymmetry of temporal pole for degree centrality in female compared to male, and opposite directionality of interhemispheric asymmetry of rectal gyrus for degree centrality between female (rightward) and male (leftward) were shown (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusion. Patterns of interhemispheric asymmetries for cingulate, superior parietal gyrus, temporal pole, and rectal gyrus are different between male and female for the similarities of the cortical thickness distribution with other brain regions. Accordingly, possible effect of gender-by-hemispheric interaction has to be considered in future studies of brain morphology and brain structural covariance networks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To describe a clinical case with a severe mandibular crowding treated without extraction and showing a long-term outcome. Methods. A 14-year-old boy in permanent dentition showed a class I molar and cuspid relationship, a severe deep bite of 8 mm, a constricted V-shaped upper arch with moderate crowding, and a severe crowding of about 12 mm in the lower arch. The panoramic X-ray showed an impacted upper right canine. The treatment started with the placement of a transpalatal bar and 0.022×0.028 in standard edgewise appliances in the upper arch and a lip bumper bonded on the second lower molars. Initial leveling of the teeth was accomplished with light Australian round wires. Finishing was then performed with rectangular wires. The phase with fixed appliances lasted 2 years and 9 months, and the patient was motivated and cooperative throughout the treatment, although with poor oral hygiene. The patient was treated without extractions. Results. The space was gained with the first and second upper molar derotations using the transpalatal bar and the gingival lip bumper in the lower arch. The upper right canine was well positioned, and the maxillary arch form was improved. The severe lower crowding was completely corrected, and a good overbite was achieved. Conclusion. A conservative, nonextraction treatment approach for this patient with class I malocclusion with severe mandibular crowding was effective, and the results have remained stable after a long-term follow-up (10 years).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. We report a case of a 1-year-old girl who was referred to us with a cerebellar anomaly and delayed growth and development for bilateral ptosis and poor fixation. Based on our ophthalmologic examination, we concluded that she has bilateral persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) with morning glory syndrome (MGS). A closer look into her neurologic condition revealed that she has Joubert’s syndrome. Observations. External examination revealed bilateral symmetrical ptosis with syndromic facies and her fundus examination revealed a large dysplastic optic disc with anomalous radiating vessels and a fibrous tissue tuft originating from the disc. The left eye showed similar findings in addition to a central excavation and a fibrovascular stalk extending from the optic disc. These findings were consistent with bilateral MGS and bilateral PFV. The brain imaging included a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, both of which revealed a “molar tooth appearance” of the midbrain and an anomalous cerebellum suggestive of Joubert’s syndrome. Conclusions and Importance. This is the first case report of a case of bilateral MGS and bilateral PFV associated with Joubert’s syndrome. This case report documents the associated optic nerve disease in these patients, not previously described, which are additive causes of visual compromise in addition to the brain insult.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Aim. Direct oral anticoagulant- (DOAC-) induced small-bowel lesions have not been described. We evaluated small-bowel lesions related to DOAC using video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Methods. This study was a prospective, open-label, nonblinded, multicenter, and observational study. From September 2013 to March 2017, patients taking DOACs were enrolled. Patients underwent VCE. The type and location of small-bowel lesions were registered. Also, (1) the proportion of lesions detected between types of DOAC was evaluated and (2) the hemoglobin (Hb) and serum ferritin levels were compared between patients with and without small-bowel lesions. Results. 33 patients were enrolled, but 4 patients withdrew their consent, and VCE was performed on 29 patients. Eight, 13, and 8 patients received dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, respectively. Small-bowel transit was complete in 27 of 29 patients (93.1%). Small-bowel lesions were detected in 23 (79.3%), redness in 12 (41.4%), erosions in 14 (48.3%), and angioectasia in 3 (10.3%) patients, and 6 patients (20.7%) had no abnormalities. Redness and erosions were detected in the upper, middle, or lower portions, but erosions tended to be less frequent in the middle portion (p=0.25, 0.06). Angioectasia was not detected in the lower portion. No patients had active bleeding. The findings did not differ according to the drug. The relationships between the endoscopic findings and the Hb and serum ferritin levels were not significant. Conclusion. Many patients taking DOACs had small-bowel lesions; however, most lesions were relatively mild. Observing small-bowel lesions over longer periods may be necessary in patients taking DOACs. This trial is registered with UMIN000011527.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With energy and environmental issues becoming increasingly prominent, electric vehicles (EVs) have become the important transportation means in the logistics distribution. In the real-world urban road network, there often exist multiple paths between any two locations (depot, customer, and charging station) since the time-dependent travel times. That is, the travel speed of an EV on each path may be different during different time periods, and thus, this paper explicitly considers path selection between two locations in the time-dependent electric vehicle routing problem with time windows, denoted as path flexibility. Therefore, the integrated decision-making should include not only the routing plan but also the path selection, and the interested problem of this paper is a time-dependent electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and path flexibility (TDEVRP-PF). In order to determine the optimal path between any two locations, an optimization model is established with the goal of minimizing the distance and the battery energy consumption associated with travel speed and cargo load. On the basis of the optimal path model, a 0-1 mixed-integer programming model is then formulated to minimize the total travel distance. Hereinafter, an improved version of the variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is utilized to solve the proposed models, in which multithreading technique is adopted to improve the solution efficiency significantly. Ultimately, several numerical experiments are carried out to test the performance of VNS with a view to the conclusion that the improved VNS is effective in finding high-quality distribution schemes consisted of the distribution routes, traveling paths, and charging plans, which are of practical significance to select and arrange EVs for logistics enterprises.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this research, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform analysis is utilized to develop a logistic regression-based predictive model for the classification of diabetes. The classifier has three predictors age, b/a, and SP indices in which they achieved an overall accuracy of 92.3% in the prediction of diabetes. In this study, a total of 587 subjects were enrolled. A total of 459 subjects were used for model training and development, while the rest of the 128 subjects were used for model testing and validation. The classifier was able to diagnose 63 patients correctly as diabetes while 27 subjects were wrongly classified as nondiabetes with an accuracy of 70%. Again, the model classified 479 subjects as nondiabetes correctly while it incorrectly classified 18 subjects as diabetes with an accuracy of 96.4%. Finally, the proposed model revealed an overall predictive accuracy of 92.3% which makes it a reliable surrogate measure for diabetes classification and prediction in clinical settings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that is used for the treatment of various types of cancer. However, its clinical usage is limited due to its potential life-threatening adverse effects, such as cardio- and nephrotoxicities. Nonetheless, simultaneous administration of doxorubicin and antioxidants, such as those found in green tea leaves, could reduce cardiac and renal tissue damage caused by oxidative stress. The methylxanthine fraction isolated from Bancha tea leaves were tested in vitro for its antioxidant activity and in vivo for its organoprotective properties against doxorubicin-induced cardio- and nephrotoxicities in a rat model. The in vivo study was conducted on male Wistar rats divided into 6 groups. Methylxanthines were administered at high (5 mg/kg body weight) and low (1 mg/kg body weight) doses, while doxorubicin was administered at a cumulative dose of 20 mg/kg body weight. Serum creatinine, uric acid, and urea concentrations, as well as serum enzyme levels (creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and electrolytes (Na+, K+, and Cl-), were analysed. In addition, histological analysis was performed to assess cardiac and renal tissue damage. The concomitant administration of Bancha methylxanthines and doxorubicin showed a dose-dependent reduction in the serum biochemical parameters, indicating a decrease in the cardiac and renal tissue damage caused by the antibiotic. Histological analysis showed that pretreatment with methylxanthines at the dose of 5 mg/kg resulted in an almost normal myocardial structure and a significant decrease in the morphological kidney changes caused by doxorubicin exposure compared with the group that received doxorubicin alone. The putative mechanism is most likely related to a reduction in the oxidative stress caused by doxorubicin.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Considering that the charging behaviors of users of electric vehicles (EVs) (including charging time and charging location) are random and uncertain and that the disorderly charging of EVs brings new challenges to the power grid, this paper proposes an optimal electricity pricing strategy for EVs based on region division and time division. Firstly, by comparing the number of EVs and charging stations in different districts of a city, the demand ratio of charging stations per unit is calculated. Secondly, according to the demand price function and the principle of profit maximization, the charging price between different districts of a city is optimized to guide users to charge in districts with more abundant charging stations. Then, based on the results of the zonal pricing strategy, the time-of-use (TOU) pricing strategy in different districts is discussed. In the TOU pricing model, consumer satisfaction, the profit of power grid enterprises, and the load variance of the power grid are considered comprehensively. Taking the optimization of the comprehensive index as the objective function, the TOU pricing optimization model of EVs is constructed. Finally, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is introduced to solve the above optimization problems. The specific data of EVs in a municipality directly under the Central Government are taken as examples for this analysis. The empirical results demonstrate that the peak-to-valley ratio of a certain day in the city is reduced from 56.8% to 43% by using the optimal pricing strategy, which further smooth the load curve and alleviates the impact of load fluctuation. To a certain extent, the problem caused by the uneven distribution of electric vehicles and charging stations has been optimized. An orderly and reasonable electricity pricing strategy can guide users to adjust charging habits, to ensure grid security, and to ensure the economic benefits of all parties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Parkinson’s disease cannot be well treated by conventional medication. Acupuncture and Tai Chi are proven to be effective in relieving symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Traditional Chinese medicine exercises may prove to be an effective complementary therapy. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of conduction exercise and self-acupressure in treating Parkinson’s disease. Method. This study is an accessor- and data analyzer-blind, add-on, randomized, controlled, pilot clinical study. In the treatment group, they were taught to practice conduction exercise and self-acupressure for 8 weeks. No additional treatment was given in the control group. Assessments were done at week 4 and week 8 of the treatment period. The primary outcomes are the total score and domain scores of the Chinese version of 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes are the total score and domain scores of a custom-designed questionnaire, which is a short form of Nonmotor Symptom Scale. Results. 22 patients in the treatment group and 14 in the control group continued to the treatment phase. Patients in the treatment group displayed improvement trends in primary and secondary outcomes. Improvements were significant in two areas of a custom-designed questionnaire: total score (p=0.014) and domain score of gastrointestinal tract (p=0.004). No severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion. Conduction exercise and self-acupressure were well accepted by and feasible for Parkinson’s disease patients. The data generated can be used for the planning of future studies. The exercise regime can be promoted as a home-based, self-practice therapy for Parkinson’s disease patients, due to its safety, low cost, and convenience in implementation. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-17011987, on 14 July 2017).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Since both O-GlcNAcylation and autophagy sense intracellular nutrient level, the alteration of those two pathways plays substantial roles in the progression of heart failure. Hence, determining the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and autophagy is imperative to understand, prevent, and treat heart failure. However, the mechanism on how O-GlcNAcylation regulates autophagy in the heart is poorly investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation is required for autophagy in cardiomyocytes by utilizing an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) cardiomyocyte-specific knockout mouse model for the first time. We also identified that OGT might regulate the initiation of autophagy in cardiomyocytes through promoting the activity of ULK1 by O-GlcNAcylation. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heart dysfunction and benefit the development of treatments for heart failure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We propose to model the phenomenon of the spread of a rumor in social networks in this paper. From an existing SIR model, we manipulate a new one that is based on the model of cholera in order to take into account professional pages that specialize in spreading rumors. In the second part, we introduce a control strategy to fight against the diffusion of the rumor. Our main objective is to characterize the three optimal controls that minimize the number of spreader users, fake pages, and the corresponding costs. For that matter, using the maximum principle of Pontryagin, we prove the existence and we give characterization of our controls. Numerical simulations are given to concretize our approach.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Pan Jun Sun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cloud computing services have great convenience, but privacy security is a big obstacle of popularity. In the process result of privacy protection of cloud computing, it is difficult to choose the optimal strategy. In order to solve this problem, we propose a quantitative weight model of privacy information, use evolutionary game theory to establish a game model of attack protection, design the optimal protection strategy selection algorithm, and make the evolutionary stable equilibrium solution method from the limited rational constraint. In order to study the strategic dependence of the same game group, the classical dynamic replication equation is improved by using the incentive coefficient, an improved evolutionary game model of attack protection is constructed, the stability of equilibrium point is further analyzed by Jacobian matrix method, and the optimal selection strategy is obtained under different conditions. Finally, the correctness and validity of the model are verified by experiments, different strategies of the same group have the dual effects of promotion and inhibition, and the advantages of this paper are shown by comparing with other articles.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jianxiong Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Inventory level has a significant impact on the goodwill of products to customers, which seldom becomes the focus of previous studies. In this paper, joint dynamic pricing, advertising, and production decision-making problem is investigated, where the demand rate depends on sales price and goodwill. The inventory and backlog as well as advertisement are considered as goodwill-building factors. The optimal dynamic pricing, advertising, and production policies are derived by using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the obtained results, and sensitivity analysis of main system parameters is carried out to obtain some managerial insights. We find that when the initial goodwill is relatively high, the firm’s profit first decreases and then increases with respect to the impact intensity of inventory on goodwill; otherwise, the firm always benefits from a higher impact intensity of inventory on goodwill. Furthermore, the optimal production and advertising policies are complementary caused by the feature of inventory-dependent goodwill.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Yiqi Huayu Jiedu (YQHYJD) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction made up of eight traditional Chinese medicines. Although YQHYJD is effectively used to prevent and treat ARDS/acute lung injury (ALI) in rats, the molecular mechanisms supporting its clinical application remain elusive. The purpose of the current study was to understand its lung protective effects at the molecular level using network pharmacology approach. Methods. In an ARDS animal model, the beneficial pharmacological activities of YQHYJD were confirmed by reduced lung tissue damage levels observed on drug treated rats versus control group. We then proposed a network analysis to discover the key nodes based on drugs and disease network. Subsequently, we analyzed interaction networks and screened key targets. Using Western blot to detect the expression level of key targets, the intervention effect of changes in expression level of key targets on ARDS was evaluated. Results. Pathway enrichment analysis of highly ranked genes showed that ErbB pathways were highly related to ARDS. Finally, western blot results showed decreased level of the AKT1 and KRAS/NRAS/HRAS protein in the lung after treatment which confirmed the hypothesis. Conclusion. In conclusion, our results suggest that YQHYJD can exert lung tissue protective effect against the severe injury through multiple pathways, including the endothelial cells permeability improvement, inflammatory reaction inhibition, edema, and lung tissue hemorrhage reduction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study assessed the relationship between Internet addiction and oral health practices and clinical outcomes and whether this was affected by oral health perception. In 2017, a cross-sectional study included university students in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Questionnaires assessed demographic background, oral health practices (consuming sugar, tobacco use, and oral hygiene), perceived oral health, and Internet addiction. Caries experience and gingivitis were assessed using the World Health Organization criteria. The multivariate general linear analysis assessed the relationship between dependent variables (oral health practices, DMFT, and gingivitis) and exposure (Internet addiction). Data were available for 919 participants, 75.4% females, mean age = 19.8 years, and 1.6% with significant Internet use problem. The mean percentage of teeth with gingivitis was 8.5% and mean DMFT was 2.9. Among those with good perception of oral health and compared with participants with significant Internet use problem, average Internet users had lower consumption of sugar and tobacco (B = −6.52, P=0.03 and B = −2.04, P=0.03), better oral hygiene practices (B = 2.07, P=0.33), higher DMFT (B = 2.53, P=0.10), and lesser gingivitis (B = −15.45, P=0.06). Internet addiction was associated with negative oral health practices and poor clinical outcomes among young Saudis. Holistic health promotion approaches need to address the negative impact of Internet addiction on health and oral health status for this at-risk age group.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Otsu’s algorithm is one of the most well-known methods for automatic image thresholding. 2D Otsu’s method is more robust compared to 1D Otsu’s method. However, it still has limitations on salt-and-pepper noise corrupted images and uneven illumination images. To alleviate these limitations and improve the overall performance, here we propose an improved 2D Otsu’s algorithm to increase the robustness to salt-and-pepper noise together with an adaptive energy based image partition technology for uneven illumination image segmentation. Based on the partition method, two schemes for automatic thresholding are adopted to find the best segmentation result. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real world uneven illumination images as well as real world regular illumination cell images. Original 2D Otsu’s method, MAOTSU_2D, and two latest 1D Otsu’s methods (Cao’s method and DVE) are included for comparisons. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is more robust to salt-and-pepper noise and acquires better segmentation results on uneven illumination images in general without compromising its performance on regular illumination images. For a test group of seven real world uneven illumination images, the proposed method could lower the ME value by 15% and increase the DSC value by 10%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Grid cells and place cells are important neurons in the animal brain. The information transmission between them provides the basis for the spatial representation and navigation of animals and also provides reference for the research on the autonomous navigation mechanism of intelligent agents. Grid cells are important information source of place cells. The supervised learning and unsupervised learning models can be used to simulate the generation of place cells from grid cell inputs. However, the existing models preset the firing characteristics of grid cell. In this paper, we propose a united generation model of grid cells and place cells. First, the visual place cells with nonuniform distribution generate the visual grid cells with regional firing field through feedforward network. Second, the visual grid cells and the self-motion information generate the united grid cells whose firing fields extend to the whole space through genetic algorithm. Finally, the visual place cells and the united grid cells generate the united place cells with uniform distribution through supervised fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) network. Simulation results show that this model has stronger environmental adaptability and can provide reference for the research on spatial representation model and brain-inspired navigation mechanism of intelligent agents under the condition of nonuniform environmental information.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induced by oxidative injury is one of the main features in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. Geranylgeranyl transferase-I (GGTase-I) is an essential enzyme mediating posttranslational modification, especially the geranylgeranylation of small GTPase, Rac1. Our previous studies found that GGTase-I played an important role in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. However, its exact role is largely unclear. In this study, mouse conditional knockout of VSMC GGTase-I (Pggt1bΔ/Δ mice) was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The mouse model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis was induced by streptozotocin injections and an atherogenic diet. We found that GGTase-I knockout attenuated diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis in vivo and suppressed high-glucose-induced VSMC proliferation in vitro. Moreover, after a 16-week duration of diabetes, Pggt1bΔ/Δ mice exhibited lower α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and nitrotyrosine level, Rac1 activity, p47phox and NOXO1 expression, and phospho-ERK1/2 and phosphor-JNK content than wild-type mice. Meanwhile, the same changes were found in Pggt1bΔ/Δ VSMCs cultured with high glucose (22.2 mM) in vitro. In conclusion, GGTase-I knockout efficiently blocked diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, and this protective effect must be related to the inhibition of VSMC proliferation. The potential mechanisms probably involved interfering Rac1 geranylgeranylation, inhibiting the assembly of NADPH oxidase cytosolic regulatory subunits, reducing oxidative injury, and decreasing ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ensuring the structural safety of a deployable solar panel under a severe launch vibration environment is one of the important factors for a successful CubeSat mission. A CubeSat’s deployable solar panel proposed in this study is effective to guarantee the structural safety of solar cells by attenuating launch loads owing to the superior damping characteristic achieved by a multilayered stiffener with viscoelastic acrylic tapes. The demonstration model of 3 U CubeSat’s deployable solar panel was fabricated and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. The basic dynamic characteristics of the solar panel were measured through free-vibration tests according to the various layers of the stiffener. Moreover, the characteristics of the deployed solar panel were measured and investigated under various temperatures to predict its capability under in-orbit operation. The effectiveness of the proposed design for launch vibration attenuation was demonstrated through qualification level sine and random vibration tests.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Globally, immunization is among the major contributors to public health, preventing 20% of childhood mortality annually. The highest fatality rates from vaccine preventable diseases are usually among children under five. Despite immunization guidelines put in place by the World Health Organization, globally, 1.5 million children die annually related to inadequate vaccination coverage. Existing literature indicate that there is an increase in nonadherence to immunization schedule in developing countries, and therefore, there is an increased demand to improve adherence to immunization schedule. Objective. To explore strategies that will improve adherence to immunization schedule among children under 24 months attending the Maternal and Child Health clinic at Kenyatta National Hospital. Methods. A cross-sectional mixed method study involving caregivers (n=214) of well babies attending the Maternal and Child Health clinic. Data was collected using semistructured questionnaires, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews and analyzed using SPSS V.20. Results. There was a significant relationship between the level of education and marital status of the caregivers and adherence to immunization schedule. Barriers found that is related to adherence to immunization schedule included far distance from health facility, baby’s sickness, and vaccine stock-outs while employment of a caregiver was a constrainer factor. Conclusion. The enabling factors to current strategies of improving adherence to immunization schedule were having more health facilities near residential areas, using text messages reminders a day before the clinic date to remind caregivers of the due date for the clinic, and constant availability of vaccines. The health system strategies that would improve adherence to immunization schedules were more flexible clinic hours, availability of vaccines on daily basis, phone call reminders by health care providers, and increasing awareness on the importance of both vaccinations and adherence to immunization schedule.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. The metabolism of three major nutrients (sugar, lipid, and protein) will change during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester. The present study is aimed at evaluating carnitine alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the second trimester of pregnancy and the correlation between carnitine and GDM. Methods. 450 pregnant women were recruited in the present prospective study. Metabolic profiling of 31 carnitines was detected by LC-MS/MS in these women. Correlation between carnitine metabolism and maternal and neonatal complication with GDM was analyzed. Results. We found the levels of 7 carnitines increased in age&gt;35, BMI≥30, weight gain&gt;20 kg, and ART pregnant groups, but the level of free carnitine (C0) decreased. Nine carnitines were specific metabolites of GDM. Prepregnancy BMI, weight gain, and carnitines (C0, C3, and C16) were independent risk factors associated with GDM and related macrosomia. C0 was negatively correlated with FBG, LDL, TG, and TC. A nomogram was developed for predicting macrosomia in GDM based on carnitine-related metabolic variables. Conclusion. The carnitine metabolism in the second trimester is abnormal in GDM women. The dysfunction of carnitine metabolism is closely related to the abnormality of blood lipid and glucose in GDM. Carnitine metabolism abnormality could predict macrosomia complicated with GDM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) have been widely applied in the shipborne rocket launcher systems due to their high torque density and high efficiency. However, since there are many external disturbances from the shipborne rocket launcher, the tracking performance under random noises needs to be improved. In this paper, an improved finite control set optimal control (IFCSOC) based on a super-twisting extended state observer (SESO) is investigated for position tracking control of PMSMs. The SESO can improve the anti-interference ability of the proposed controller. Moreover, in order to improve tracking accuracy, Taylor’s formula is used to solve the phase-lag problem of nonlinear tracking differentiator in IFCSOC. Simulation shows that compared with conventional FCSOC, IFCSOC exhibits better robustness under random disturbances. Furthermore, the semiphysical experiment is conducted to verify the proposed IFCSOC strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Increasing physical objects connected to the Internet make it possible for smart things to access all kinds of cloud services. Mashup has been an effective way to the rapid IoT (Internet of Things) application development. It remains a big challenge to bridge the semantic gap between user expectations and application functionality with the development of mashup services. This paper proposes a mashup service recommendation approach via merging semantic features from API descriptions and structural features from the mashup-API network. To validate our approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a real-world accessible service repository, ProgrammableWeb. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A theoretical and experimental study on the separation method of the incident sound field based on a small-scale vector sensor is proposed in this study, with the aim of resolving the problem of separation and acquisition of an incident sound field under the interference of near-field sound scattering from a cylindrical shell in water. The method of identifying and separating sound waves obtained under plane wave conditions is extended to complex sound-field conditions. Simulation and experimental results show that the vector separation method can greatly reduce the sound pressure amplitude and the phase deviation of the incident sound field, which is affected by near-field scattering from the cylindrical surface. The separation accuracy is related to the deviation angle and the distance from the target surface. The maximum deviation of the pressure amplitude is less than 1 dB, and the phase deviation is less than 3°. This method can effectively suppress the near-field scattering of the cylindrical shell and improve the separation accuracy of the incident sound field. The research results have reference value for a range of practical engineering applications.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Wu Shuang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A method for satellite downlink signal detection based on a generative adversarial network is proposed. The generator adversarial network and adversarial network are established, respectively. The generator network realizes the local generator of satellite signals, and the adversarial network is used for high-precision signal detection. The error network is generated by the error signal to form the satellite link downlink. The network reconstructs the optimal weights by generating errors, forms an error matrix for different satellite downlink, and then forms an adaptive matrix weight adjustment. Through the reconstruction of the optimal detection matrix, detection for the downlink signals of multiple satellites is completed. The proposed generative adversarial network can realize the high-precision detection for the downlink signal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the paper, joint angle and range estimation issue for monostatic frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) is proposed, and a tensor-based framework is addressed to solve it. The proposed method exploits the multidimensional structure of matched filters in FDA-MIMO radar. Firstly, stack the received data to form a third-order tensor so that the multidimensional structure information of the received data can be acquired. Then, the steering matrices contain the angle and rang information are estimated by using the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Finally, the angle and range are achieved by utilizing the phase characteristic of the steering matrices. Due to exploiting the multidimensional structure of the received data to further suppress the effect of noise, the proposed method performs better in angle and range estimation than the existing algorithms based on ESPRIT, simulation results can prove the proposed method’s effectiveness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aiming at correcting the error caused by the nonlinear and power supply noise of the bridge-tied-load (BTL) power stage of the filterless digital class D power amplifier, an error correction method was proposed based on feedforward power supply noise suppression (FFPSNS) and first-order closed loop negative feedback (FCLNF) techniques. This method constructed the first-order LCLNF loop for the power stage and further reduced the impact of the power supply noise on the power amplifier output by using FFPSNS technology to introduce the power supply noise into the feedback loop at the same time. The 0.35 μm CMOS process is used for analysis and comparison in Cadence. Cadence simulation results indicate that PSRR at the power supply noise frequency of 200 Hz is improved with 36.02 dB. The power supply induced intermodulation distortion (PS-IMD) components are decreased by approximately 15.57 dB and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the power amplifier is increased by 17 dB. The total harmonic distortion + noise (THD + N) of the power amplifier is reduced to 0.02% by FCLNF + FFPSNS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes a new transmission scheme of hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT) for tractors. The HMCVT has 4 working ranges in each of the front and rear directions. The speed characteristic and the torque characteristic of HMCVT are theoretically derived. On the basis of HMCVT power flow direction, the Крейнeс formula is used to calculate the transmission efficiency. Then, the image analysis method is used to study the influence of parameters on the transmission efficiency of HMCVT, and the main influencing factors are found. The results of theoretical derivation demonstrate that, by coordinating control of the HST displacement ratio and the engagement conditions of shifting clutches, the stepless speed regulation of HMCVT at the tractor speed of 0–50 km/h can be realized. The proposed HMCVT has the ability to continuously transmit and change torque over all working ranges. The overall transmission efficiency of HMCVT is at a high level. To verify the theoretical derivation, Amesim simulation software is used for the modeling and simulation of HMCVT. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical analysis results. Therefore, the HMCVT proposed in this paper has the advantages of compact structure and high transmission efficiency, and it is suitable for matching tractors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wavy horizontal sections are typically encountered in horizontal gas wells, which will result in gas accumulation on top of the wavy horizontal sections. This gas accumulation can be a problem and may trigger gas kick or blowout accident while tripping and pulling this gas into the vertical section. In this paper, a numerical model for gas accumulation and gas migration in the wavy horizontal sections of the horizontal gas well is developed; meanwhile, the gas accumulation and gas migration process is numerically investigated. The results show that the gas exhausting time in the wavy horizontal section increases with the increase of the wellbore curvature and the critical drilling fluid flow velocity for gas exhausting increases with the increase of the wellbore curvature. When the drilling fluid flow velocity is higher than the critical drilling fluid flow velocity for gas exhausting, no gas accumulation will occur. With all other parameter values set constant, the number of the wavy horizontal sections has a great effect on the gas-liquid flow pattern while it has little effect on the efficiency of the gas exhausting. This work provides drilling engineers with a practical tool for designing the drilling fluid flow velocity to avoid gas kick or blowout accident in horizontal gas well drilling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the uncertainty and difficulty of estimating the investment payback period of the airport bridge facility, a model for calculating the investment payback period of bridge facility is proposed in this paper from the perspective of airport routine operation. Based on the actual operational data of Kunming Changshui Airport, Wuhan Tianhe Airport, and Lijiang Sanyi Airport in 2018, the factors influencing the payback period of bridge facility are the number of bridge facilities and service time, which have been discussed in this paper. According to the simulation, it is concluded that the number of bridge facilities and service time are the key points to the length of the investment payback period, and the annual operating cost of the airline can be saved quite a lot. The research results can be used to assist the leaders’ decision-making of airports and airlines for the promotion of the service of bridge facilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) approach is developed for the systematic quantification and propagation of uncertainties in the modelling and simulation of lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) and applied to the demonstration LFR (DLFR) initially investigated by Westinghouse. The impact of nuclear data uncertainties based on ENDF/B-VII.0 covariances is quantified on lattice level using the generalized perturbation theory implemented with the Monte Carlo code Serpent and the deterministic code PERSENT of the Argonne Reactor Computational (ARC) suite. The quantities of interest are the main eigenvalue and selected reactivity coefficients such as Doppler, radial expansion, and fuel/clad/coolant density coefficients. These uncertainties are then propagated through safety analysis, carried out using the MiniSAS code, following the stochastic sampling approach in DAKOTA. An unprotected transient overpower (UTOP) scenario is considered to assess the effect of input uncertainties on safety parameters such as peak fuel and clad temperatures. It is found that in steady state, the multiplication factor shows the most sensitivity to perturbations in 235U fission, 235U ν, and 238U capture cross sections. The uncertainties of 239Pu and 238U capture cross sections become more significant as the fuel is irradiated. The covariance of various reactivity feedback coefficients is constructed by tracing back to common uncertainty contributors (i.e., nuclide-reaction pairs), including 238U inelastic, 238U capture, and 239Pu capture cross sections. It is also observed that nuclear data uncertainty propagates to uncertainty on peak clad and fuel temperatures of 28.5 K and 70.0 K, respectively. Such uncertainties do not impose per se threat to the integrity of the fuel rod; however, they sum to other sources of uncertainties in verifying the compliance of the assumed safety margins, suggesting the developed BEPU method necessary to provide one of the required insights on the impact of uncertainties on core safety characteristics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of intravitreal injections (IVI) of ranibizumab and aflibercept on the choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with treatment-naive diabetic macular edema (DME) before and after monthly IVI. Patients and Methods. Prospective monocenter study. Inclusion criteria were treatment-naive DME eyes without concomitant panretinal photocoagulation, associated with a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity ≤75 letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. DME was defined by a central retinal thickness ≥300 μm on swept-source OCT (Triton DRI OCT, Topcon Corporation, Itabashi, Japan). Patients received 5 IVI of ranibizumab or aflibercept. The primary endpoint was the change in the central subfield CT (CSCT) between inclusion (M0) and 1 month after the fifth IVI (M5). The secondary endpoint was the CT changes between M0 and M5 in other locations of the macular ETDRS grid. Results. Twenty-four eyes of 24 patients with a mean age of 61.1 years were included. Eleven and 13 patients were, respectively, treated with ranibizumab and aflibercept, and 86.4% had type 2 diabetes. The overall CSCT decreased significantly by −12 μm between M0 and M5 (231.7 μm at M0 and 219.7 μm at M5) (p=0.03). It decreased by −15.2 μm (p=0.02) in the aflibercept group (206.9 μm at M0 and 191.7 μm at M5) and by −7.3 μm (p=0.4) in the ranibizumab group (267.5 μm at M0 and 260.2 μm at M5). The CSCT decreased by −4.9 μm in noninjected contralateral eyes (242.3 μm at M0 and 237.4 μm at M5). CT changes between M0 and M5 in the superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal macular inner ring were significant in the aflibercept group but not in the ranibizumab and control groups. Conclusion. In DME patients, the CSCT decreases after 5 IVI of anti-VEGF, especially after aflibercept treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This manuscript presents a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control for a mathematical model of the knee position of paraplegic patients using functional electrical stimulation (FES). Each local model of the fuzzy system is represented considering norm-bounded uncertainties. After obtaining the model of FES with norm-bounded uncertainties, the fuzzy control strategy is designed through the solution of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) using the conditions available in the literature, which consider these norm-bounded uncertainties. The strategy considers decay rate and constraints on the input signal. The model is simulated in the Matlab environment using the numerical parameters measured by experimental tests from a paraplegic patient.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly known as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative disease (UC), is a chronic and relapsing intestinal disease which cannot be cured completely. The prevalence of IBD in Europe and in North America has increased over the past 20 years. As most IBD patients are young at onset, their quality of life (QOL) can be influenced to varying degrees. Thus, current treatment goals are typically focused on preventing complications, including maintaining clinical remission and improving the QOL. Adjuvant therapies have been widely concerned as an effective treatment in alleviating IBD symptoms, including dietary intervention, traditional Chinese medicine, smoking, alcohol, and physical activities. This review focuses on different ancillary therapies for IBD treatments, in particular the mechanism of reducing inflammation based on the actual data from research studies. Moreover, comparing the latest data, this review also presented potential future prospect for adjuvant therapies.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ming-Can Fan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wen Qin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper deals with the leader-following output consensus problem for a class of high-order affine nonlinear strict-feedback multiagent systems with unknown control gains and input saturation under a general directed graph. Nussbaum gain function technique is used to handle the unknown control gains, and the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of each agent is approximated by radial basis function neural networks. Distributed adaptive controllers are designed via the backstepping technique as well as the dynamic surface control approach. It is proved that the closed-loop multiagent systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output consensus error can converge to a small region around the origin. Finally, the theoretical results are supported by a numerical simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the rapid development of computer technology, some machine learning methods have begun to gradually integrate into the petroleum industry and have achieved some achievements, whether in conventional or unconventional reservoirs. This paper presents an alternative method to predict vertical heterogeneity of the reservoir utilizing various deep neural networks basing on dynamic production data. A numerical simulation technique was adopted to obtain the required dataset, which contains dynamic production data calculated under different heterogeneous reservoir conditions. Machine learning models were established through deep neural networks, which learn and capture the characteristics better between dynamic production data and reservoir heterogeneity, so as to invert the vertical permeability. On the basis of model validation, the results show that machine learning methods have excellent performance in predicting heterogeneity with the RMSE of 12.71 mD, which effectively estimated the permeability of the entire reservoir. Moreover, the overall AARD of the predictive result obtained by the CNN method was controlled at 11.51%, revealing the highest accuracy compared with BP and LSTM neural networks. And the permeability contrast, an important parameter to characterize heterogeneity, can be predicted precisely as well, with a derivation of below 10%. This study proposed a potential for vertical heterogeneity prediction in reservoir basing on machine learning methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the increasing demand of users for power sources and quality, how to provide high-quality renewable clean energy has become a key issue of power electronics. The main idea of this paper is to develop a composite control including a PI control and repetitive control for a single-phase grid-connected inverter to eliminate the effects of harmonics, which can obtain better steady-state and dynamic responses of the single-phase inverter system and reduce the net current harmonics. The modelling of a single-phase inverter is first introduced; then a first-order repetitive control is developed for the proposed grid-connected inverter. Moreover, a high-order repetitive controller is adopted to further improve the robustness against the uncertainties in the period of signals. The stability and performance analysis are given for the first-order repetitive control and high-order repetitive control. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted in a circuit-level inverter model, which show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Model predictive control (MPC) method has been widely used to reduce the computational complexity of the traditional space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM). However, for a neutral-point clamped three-level Z-source converter, the performance of the normal MPC strategy would highly depend on the computation processing rate because of the multiple times optimization calculation. In this paper, an improved MPC strategy has been developed, with a voltage prediction being designed to replace the current prediction, the calculation of the roll optimization could be effectively simplified significantly, and then the digital execution efficiency would be improved. Besides, in order to obtain a fixed output harmonic frequency, a combination of this improved MPC and SVPWM has been studied and the shoot-through state insertion for the Z-source also has been analyzed in detail. Lastly, comparison experiments have been carried out to make verification of this improved modulation mechanism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Adipogenesis is the process through which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes. During this process, the preadipocytes cease to proliferate, begin to accumulate lipid droplets, and develop morphologic and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of adult stem cells known for their high plasticity and capacity to generate mesodermal and nonmesodermal tissues. Many mature cell types can be generated from MSCs, including adipocyte, osteocyte, and chondrocyte. The differentiation of stem cells into multiple mature phenotypes is at the basis for tissue regeneration and repair. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a very important role in tumor development and have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. Accumulating evidence has shown that cancer cells can be induced to differentiate into various benign cells, such as adipocytes, fibrocytes, osteoblast, by a variety of small molecular compounds, which may provide new strategies for cancer treatment. Recent studies have reported that tumor cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes. In this review, molecular mechanisms, signal pathways, and the roles of various biological processes in adipose differentiation are summarized. Understanding the molecular mechanism of adipogenesis and adipose differentiation of cancer cells may contribute to cancer treatments that involve inducing differentiation into benign cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to promote the sustainable use of oil shale residues, a novel subgrade material (SOF) composed of silty clay, oil shale ash residue, and fly ash was developed. The aim of this paper is to study the mechanical behavior and environmental impact of SOF, which is regarded as the safety assessment and prediction for the application of this novel material. To this purpose, the road performance, dynamic properties, and environment impact tests are conducted. In terms of the road performance, the test results of SOF exceed the standard requirement, especially for CBR (California bearing ratio), which can maintain good performance at bad conditions of low compaction degree and being soaked for a long time. The dynamic properties under cyclic loadings are better than most of original and stabilized soils. The shear strength parameters and the anti-damage mechanism are also discussed; research results show that the friction of SOF mostly contributes to shear strength under high stress conditions, while its cohesion tends to play a more important role under low stress conditions. According to the deformation variation, the accumulation settlement of SOF under vehicle loadings after several years is predicted, which is far lower than the limit of expressway and Grade I highway. Furthermore, the chemical stability and toxicity of SOF leachates are environmentally friendly, which are in line with the benchmarks of Class II surface water and Class III ground water. All the experimental results manifest that SOF used as subgrade filling has good application potential and safety.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Kunxian Capsule (KXC) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of KXC in patients with RA were included in this study. Weighted mean differences (MDs) were calculated for net changes by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. Nine RCTs were included in the systematic review with a total of 747 patients. The overall effects showed that KXC alone or combined with disease-modifying antirheumatic and drugs decreased tender joint counts (P=0.02, MD = −1.07, 95% CI: −1.95 to −0.18), shortened duration of morning stiffness (P&lt;0.0001, MD = −9.01, 95% CI: −13.08 to −4.93), lowered erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P&lt;0.00001, MD = −5.27, 95% CI: −6.78 to −3.77), and reduced C-reactive protein (P&lt;0.0001, MD = −5.04, 95% CI: −7.28 to −2.80). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances and abnormal liver function. These results suggest that KXC is likely to be a more effective and safe candidate for treating RA compared with conventional therapies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Search engines and recommendation systems are an essential means of solving information overload, and recommendation algorithms are the core of recommendation systems. Recently, the recommendation algorithm of graph neural network based on social network has greatly improved the quality of the recommendation system. However, these methods paid far too little attention to the heterogeneity of social networks. Indeed, ignoring the heterogeneity of connections between users and interactions between users and items may seriously affect user representation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical attention recommendation system (HA-RS) based on mask social network, combining social network information and user behavior information, which improves not only the accuracy of recommendation but also the flexibility of the network. First, learning the node representation in the item domain through the proposed Context-NE model and then the feature information of neighbor nodes in social domain is aggregated through the hierarchical attention network. It can fuse the information in the heterogeneous network (social domain and item domain) through the above two steps. We propose the mask mechanism to solve the cold-start issues for users and items by randomly masking some nodes in the item domain and in the social domain during the training process. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is one of the most devastating cardiovascular diseases worldwide and it draws much attention from numerous scientists. As an indispensable part of pulmonary artery, smooth muscle cells are worthy of being carefully investigated. To elucidate the pathogenesis of PH, several theories focusing on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), such as hyperproliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and cancer theory, have been proposed and widely studied. Here, we tried to summarize the studies, concentrating on the role of PASMC in the development of PH, feasible molecular basis to intervene, and potential treatment to PH.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hua Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, we first introduce some new classes of weighted amalgam spaces. Then, we give the weighted strong-type and weak-type estimates for fractional integral operators Iγ on these new function spaces. Furthermore, the weighted strong-type estimate and endpoint estimate of linear commutators b,Iγ generated by b and Iγ are established as well. In addition, we are going to study related problems about two-weight, weak-type inequalities for Iγ and b,Iγ on the weighted amalgam spaces and give some results. Based on these results and pointwise domination, we can prove norm inequalities involving fractional maximal operator Mγ and generalized fractional integrals ℒ−γ/2 in the context of weighted amalgam spaces, where 0&lt;γ&lt;n and L is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup on L2Rn with Gaussian kernel bounds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Belief and plausibility measures in Dempster–Shafer theory (DST) and fuzzy sets are known as different approaches for representing partial, uncertainty, and imprecise information. There are several generalizations of DST to fuzzy sets proposed in the literature. But, less generalization of DST to intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), that can somehow present imprecise information better than fuzzy sets, was proposed. In this paper, we first propose a simple and intuitive way to construct a generalization of DST to IFSs with degrees of belief and plausibility in terms of degrees of membership and nonmembership, respectively. We then give belief and plausibility measures on IFSs and construct belief-plausibility intervals (BPIs) of IFSs. Based on the constructed BPIs, we first use Hausdorff metric to define the distance between two BPIs and then establish similarity measures in the generalized context of DST to IFSs. By employing the techniques of ordered preference similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), the proposed belief and plausibility measures on IFSs in the framework of DST enable us to construct a belief-plausibility TOPSIS for solving multicriteria decision-making problems. Some examples are presented to manifest that the proposed method is reasonable, applicable, and well suited in the environment of IFSs in the framework of generalization of DST.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Aims. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is common in patients with end-stage liver disease and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or hepatitis B virus- (HBV-) related cirrhosis. To date, no uniform definition and management strategy are available for ACLF. Although a considerable number of studies on ACLF has been published, there are few reports on ACLF in pregnant women with CHB. This study retrospectively reviewed five patients who were diagnosed with ACLF during pregnancy in the past 10 years. We aimed at investigating their clinical characteristics, treatment, biochemical test results, and maternal and fetal outcomes. Results. Asthenia, anorexia, and jaundice were the main initial clinical manifestations in these patients during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. All patients received antiviral therapy. None of the pregnant women died after treatment. Patient #4 was treated with an artificial liver support system, and patients #2 and #5 underwent transfusion therapy. The acute insult in all patients was HBV DNA reactivation. Except for patient #3, who chose an actively induced vaginal delivery because of intrauterine fetal demise, the remaining four patients underwent a preterm delivery via a cesarean section. The four neonates were alive, although all were small for gestational age. Conclusion. Asthenia, anorexia, and jaundice during mid-late pregnancy should be immediately investigated. Before and during the pregnancy, hepatologists or obstetricians should actively screen pregnant women with CHB for HBV DNA status and alanine aminotransferase levels. Reactivation of HBV replication in pregnant women with CHB may lead to ACLF, especially in multiparous women. Once ACLF is diagnosed, antiviral therapy should be considered as soon as possible to protect maternal and fetal health.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aiming at the problem of excessive propeller noise in a new type of electric aircraft, in order to ensure the propeller aerodynamic characteristics simultaneously, a noise reduction method for improving the shape of the blade along the spanwise is proposed. The FW-H model, the unsteady slip mesh, and the large eddy simulation method are investigated to obtain the aerodynamic noise spectrum. Initially, through propeller aerodynamic noise numerical simulation, we obtain the sound pressure and aircraft aerodynamic noise in frequency domain. Subsequently, the effectiveness of our method is verified by comparing the experimental data and numerical results. Based on the established calculation model and method, under three different rotation speeds, the distribution law of the sound pressure level of the propeller with different shapes along the spanwise is analyzed, and the influence of the blade shape on the aerodynamic noise of the propeller is obtained. The research shows that the aerodynamic noise of the new blade compared to the original blade is significantly reduced at the same rotation speed higher than 1000 rpm, indicating that the blade load noise plays a dominant role in the aerodynamic noise and can be effectively reduced by changing the blade shape along the spanwise, thus reducing the aerodynamic noise of the blade.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The acquisition of reading comprehension abilities and written expression is one of the key factors among learning processes in which students show many difficulties. For this reason, it is necessary to implement effective intervention strategies from early school years. The program EPI.com is aimed at improving lexical, semantic, and syntactic processes related to the reading process. This work aims to analyze the efficiency of EPI.com in years 1&amp;2 of Primary Education. Participants in the research were 62 students (ages 6–8), who were assigned to an Experimental Group (EG; 38 students receiving the EPI.com intervention) and a Control Group (CG; 24 following traditional teaching and learning methods). The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities and the Peabody test were applied before and after the intervention was carried out. Results showed that the strategy was effective in EG in improving the psycholinguistic aspects measured by the ITPA, with better results in the variables related to syntactic and lexical processing. Taking the results into account, it was concluded that EPI.com allows students to improve the abilities relating to reading skills. Also, the results highlight the need to incorporate interventions aimed at favoring maturation in some key aspects at early ages.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. A number of researches focused on the study of tumors have concluded that the expression level of lncRNA NKILA was decreased in different tumors. This is an indication that NKILA might influence the start and growth of a cancer. In addition, studies have fatalities and worsening health of cancer patients is associated with a reduced level of NKILA. Results. The results are the collective screening of nine total studies which included 937 cancer patients. The prognosis of the meta-analysis indicated that cancer patients with a higher expression of NKILA had an overall longer survival (OS) (HR=0.808, 95% CI: 0.736, 0.887); with regard to the clinical prognosis, the results indicated that reduced NKILA was associated with advanced clinical stage (OR=0.313, 95% CI: 0.225, 0.434), poor histological grades (OR=0.833, 95% CI: 0.508, 1.367), positive lymph node metastasis (OR=0.253, 95% CI: 0.144, 0.444), and additional tumor invasion depth (OR=0.326, 95% CI: 0.234, 0.454). Materials and Methods. Related research conducted was accessed by searching in PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords. The accessed material was till the 25th of February, 2020. The present quantitative meta-analysis was done using Stata SE12.0. The aim of the meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between NKILA expression level and clinical prognosis. Conclusions. In the result of this meta-analysis, decreased NKILA expression is typical of different kinds of cancer. Moreover, it can perform as a predictive element of prognosis in varied kinds of cancer. Nonetheless, till now, it is deemed essential to carry out larger-size as well as better designed research works for the confirmation of our findings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Object. In this study, our aim is to evaluate the efficiency of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) on chronic Achilles tendinopathy (CAT) with different courses of disease. Methods. The data of 66 patients with CAT received ESWT was reviewed. According to the disease courses, those cases were allocated to short-term group (ST group, symptom duration 3-6 months) and long-term group (LT group, symptom duration &gt;6 months). Propensity scores match (PSM) method was conducted to eliminate the confound factors in baseline features including gender, sport history, sides, type of CAT, BMI (body mass index), age, and scores evaluated by AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) before ESWT. After balancing the features between ST and LT group, postinterventional VAS, AOFAS, and rate of Likert satisfaction scale at the 3rd month after first ESWT was statistically analyzed. Results. Among the baseline features in ST and LT group, gender (female ratio, 44.4% vs 71.4%, p=0.041) and BMI (23.26±2.15 vs 24.63±2.41, p=0.024) were identified as confound factors. After elimination of biased features with PSM, 3 months after first ESWT, AOFAS and VAS in both groups are significantly improved, when compared with their scores at baseline (p&lt;0.01). Moreover, at postintervention month 3 (PIM3), AOFAS in ST group is significantly higher than LT group (85.08±9.83 vs 76.76±9.85, t=76.76±9.85, p=0.019), and the rate of Likert satisfaction in ST group is better than LT group; although, it did not reach but close to significant level (70.6% vs 47.1%, χ2=1.943, p=0.163). However, there is no statistical difference of VAS scores between two groups after ESWT (1.96±0.98 vs 2.24±1.29, t=0.703, p=0.487). Conclusions. ESWT could effectively relieve pain and improve function of hind foot in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy, and especially, it could offer better benefit on functional improvement in patients with short duration of CAT symptom.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To determine the conclusive integrity in the Shiraz Cohort Heart Study (SCHS) project, management began quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) of the collected data throughout the study end-points. The QA is a focused process that prevents and detects data collection errors and verification of intended requirements in the SCHS. The QC is a subset of QA intended to capture errors in processing data through testing and preventive processes to identify problems, defects, or intended requirements. SCHS involved 10,000 males and females aged 40-70 over a 10-year follow-up period with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in the city of Shiraz, Iran. The study measured events and access to preventive care in Shiraz city. The SCHS identified unique barriers to select national study models in developing standardized measures related to variations in ethnicity, religion, cross-cultural considerations, and others. A suggested response to this problem was to develop a mechanism to standardize elements of the questionnaire, study design, and method of administration. This action was based on the geographically normal distribution of the Family Physician Health and Medical Services in Shiraz. Important QA and QC decisions were developed and adopted in the construction of the SCHS and follow-up to ensure conclusive integrity.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Zhihe Cheng</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yousheng Deng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Based on the characteristics of moso bamboo including high short-term strength, stable performance, and ability to provide temporary support for shallow foundation pits in soft soil, the stress characteristics and supporting effects of the ecological composite supporting system have been explored through model tests and numerical calculation analysis of the moso bamboo micropile-composite soil nailing structure. The results showed that the bamboo pile can effectively control the horizontal deformation of the side wall of the foundation pit and the ground surface settlement, achieving a relatively satisfactory supporting effect. Furthermore, the bamboo pile has visibly bent in middle and lower parts, where the regional shear point is most likely to appear, the axial force of the soil nail is distributed in an oval pattern with a smaller force on both sides and a larger force in the middle part, the maximum axial strain is 447.3 με, and the axial force of the soil nails in each row follows a similar trend. The synergy of piles and soil nails can delay the formation of the slip surface, therefore enhancing the overall bearing capacity of the foundation pit. These results can shed light on the support mechanism and engineering design of bamboo piles in shallow soft soil foundation pits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Niobium has been considered for applications in the aerospace sector, but its use at high temperatures is restricted, due to the great affinity of refractory metals with oxygen, which results in the formation of oxide layers and a decrease in their mechanical resistances. In the present work, Nb samples were submitted to High-Temperature Nitrogen Plasma-Based Ion Implantation (HT-NPBII). The process runs at a working pressure between 3 and 4 mbar and negative high voltage pulses of 7 kV/30 μs/300 Hz were applied to samples heated to 1000°C, at treatment times of 1 h, 4 h, and 8 h, respectively. Microstructural and mechanical characterizations of the treated samples revealed the formation of a layer of Nb2N, with 3.0 μm thickness and increase in the surface hardness from 225 HV for the untreated material up to about 2498 HV, for samples treated during 8 h. Creep tests were performed at 500°C and with loads varying from 25 to 40 MPa. Results indicated a decrease in the secondary creep rate for treated specimens when compared to the untreated ones. This behavior can be attributed to the formation of a nitride layer on the surface of Nb that acts as barrier to avoid the oxygen diffusion into the material under high temperature conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Jiao Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Based on the perspective of cost risk management of the entire process of power grid construction project, the WBS-RBS risk identification method is applied. The risk factors of power grid engineering cost are comprehensively identified from the five major engineering cost formation stages: investment decision estimate stage, design estimate stage, bidding price stage, construction budget stage, and final account stage. Combined with the basic data obtained from the questionnaire, the membership degree method is adopted to screen the key indicators of the preliminary factors of cost risk and then eliminate the redundant indicators. Furthermore, a set of simple and efficient risk evaluation index system for power grid engineering cost is constructed in order to improve the risk evaluation and management level of power grid construction project in China.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Xiaozhi Li</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yutong Meng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction. Glioblastoma is the most malignant grade of glioma, and it is also the most common primary tumor in the brain. Immunotherapy is a kind of precise tumor treatment. However, there are limited studies about immune-related lncRNA. This study is aimed at analyzing immune-related lncRNAs in glioblastoma and screening out prognostic factors, providing new potential targets for glioblastoma immunology research. Material and Methods. Gene expression data and clinical data of IDH wild-type with MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma were acquired from the TCGA and CGGA databases. Immune-related lncRNAs were identified with the help of data from the InnateDB database. Immune prognostic factors were recognized by Cox regression analysis. GSEA analysis pursued their potential functions. Results. We found 318 immune-related lncRNAs. Among them, there were 137 immune-related lncRNAs that were upregulated and 181 that were downregulated. 15 prognostic lncRNAs were identified by Cox regression, and a total of 6 molecules were included in the following risk scoring model. GSEA showed that these lncRNAs participated in functions such as protein digestion and absorption and the PPAR signaling pathway. Conclusion. There are limited studies about immune regulation mechanisms of lncRNA in IDH wild-type with MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastoma. The identified immune-related lncRNAs in glioblastoma might contribute new targets and research directions for immunological molecular studies of glioblastoma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. This study is aimed at assessing pharmacists’ knowledge and practice of issue related to usage of psychotropic medications in elderly people, in Gondar town Northwest, Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacists working in community, health center, and hospital pharmacies in Gondar town from March 1 to May 30, 2020. A total of 73 medication retail outlets (40 pharmacies and 33 drug stores) were included in this study. Pharmacy personnel’s knowledge and practice were assessed using self-administered validated questionnaires. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between different variables. P&lt;0.05 was used to declare the association. Result. A total of 144 pharmacists were included in the study; the mean age was 30.13 (SD ±5.87), ranging from 20 to 55years. The mean knowledge score was 7.789 (SD ±2.98), and 75 (52.1%) of them had poor knowledge. The mean practice score was 2.32±0.912 (mean±SD), and 77 (53.5%) of the respondents had poor practice. All participants had not taken on-the-job training about psychotropic medication. Work experience (P&lt;0.029) and personal monthly income (P&lt;0.046) were significantly associated with pharmacists’ knowledge. There was a significant association between work experience and practice level (P&lt;0.043). Conclusion. The knowledge and practice of pharmacy personnel were low for issues related to the use of psychotropic medication in the elderly. This result indicates the need for training for pharmacists on pharmacotherapy of psychotropic medication.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The determination of factors associated with progression of cervical cancer is important, both for a recurrence risk assessment and for determining optimal treatment tactics. Previously, we showed the prognostic value of different types of tumor microvessels (MVs) in gastric and breast cancer. The object of this research was to study the morphology and clinical significance of different tumor microvessels in early cervical cancer. A total of 65 archived paraffin blocks of patients with I-IIA stages of squamous cervical cancer were investigated. Samples were stained with Mayer hematoxylin and immunohistochemically using antibodies to CD34, podoplanin, HIF-1a, and Snail. The eight types of tumor MVs differed in morphology were identified. It was established that only the dilated capillaries (DСs) with weak expression of CD34, the contact type DCs, the capillaries in tumor solid component, and the lymphatic vessels in the lymphoid and polymorphic cell infiltrates of tumor stroma are associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of early cervical cancer. Preliminary results also suggest that a combination of fragmentation in tumor solid component and the contact type DCs may predict a recurrence of early cervical cancer. Given the small number of cervical cancer recurrences, the predictive significance of the described markers requires a more thorough examination.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The influence of altitude on caffeine, 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), and nicotinic acid contents of Arabica coffee varieties grown in Southwest Ethiopia was investigated. High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was used for the determination of the target analytes. Coffee samples were collected from four coffee varieties, named as 74112, 7454, 7440, and 74110, which are cultivated in high, mid, and low altitudes in the study area. The findings of the study showed that the contents of caffeine and 5-CQA in both raw and roasted coffee beans decrease as the growing altitude increases and, thus, for all varieties, their highest concentrations were recorded in lowland coffee beans. Nevertheless, the contents of nicotinic acid increase as the altitude rises and, thus, the highest nicotinic acid content was recorded in highland coffee samples. Besides, after roasting, the contents of caffeine were increased, whereas the contents of 5-CQA were lowered, indicating the possibility of its degradation during the roasting process. Both green and roasted coffee beans also contained relatively higher concentrations of nicotinic acids. Other than the growing altitudes, the contents of caffeine, 5-CQA, and nicotinic acid in coffee beans also vary with coffee varieties. Therefore, coffee varieties that are cultivated at various altitudes may have different biochemical compositions such as caffeine, CGAs, and nicotinic acid that could greatly influence the flavor, aroma, and stimulating attributes of coffee cup quality as well as dietary benefits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper is aimed at improving the performance of a building-integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) system driven by a refrigerant pump. The research is aimed at optimizing and upgrading the BIPV/T system to address the shortcomings of the original system by replacing roll-bond PV/T units with improved heat transfer features. The system’s connecting form was redesigned using a liquid separator to solve the uneven distribution of the refrigerant on the PV/T façade. We proposed the variable frequency refrigerant pump that can be adjusted to suit the working condition. An experimental study was performed to analyze the electrical and thermal efficiency of the proposed system. The results show that the electrical efficiency of the BIPV/T system was 8% which is 14.3% higher than the traditional BIPV system, while in the test period, the BIPV/T system average COP was 3.4. The thermal and comprehensive efficiencies were 20% and 42%, respectively. Besides, the proposed system’s average COP was 3.7 times greater than the original BIPV/T system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Studies in developed countries have revealed an association of different magnitudes between watching television and the risk of being overweight and obese among reproductive age women. Even so, there is no evidence of such an association in the context of the Ethiopian population. Hence, the study aimed to assess the association between watching television with overweight and obesity in a nationally representative sample of Ethiopian women. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted by using secondary data analysis from 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey among women aged from 15 to 49 years. The samples were selected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. A total of 10,074 women were included in the analysis. The outcome variables were both overweight and obesity, whereas the main exposure variable was the frequency of watching television. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for adjusting potential confounders. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals was used to declare a statistically significant association. Results. The study found that watching television at least once a week was significantly associated with both overweight (AOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.20–2.73) and obesity (AOR: 3.76; 95% CI: 2.04–6.95). The study also divulged that the odds of overweight were higher among women aged 25–39 years (AOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.25–3.77) and 40–49 years (AOR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.45–5.00), urban residents (AOR: 1.76; 95% CI:1.17–2.65), attended higher education (AOR:2.11; 95% CI: 1.22–3.65), and richest in the wealth index (AOR: 2.83; 95% CI:1.71–4.68). Similarly, the odds of obesity were higher among women aged 25–39 years and 40–49 years, attended higher education, and the richest in wealth index. Conclusions. The results from this study demonstrated that watching television at least once a week is associated with obesity among reproductive age women in Ethiopia. Therefore, a social behavioral change communication campaign needs to be taken to improve awareness regarding the harmful consequences of watching television for long hours. Further research studies should be conducted among men and adolescents to determine whether this positive association exists among that target population as well.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eye infections caused by bacteria are a serious public health problem among pediatric patients. These diseases, if not properly treated, can cause blindness and impaired vision. The study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profiles of the main pathogens involved in eye infections. This study involved pediatric patients enrolled at the “Luigi Vanvitelli” University Hospital of Campania in Naples, Italy, between 2017 and 2019. Of a total of 228 pediatric patients, 73 (32%) tested positive for bacterial infection. In terms of strain distribution, 85% were Gram-positive bacteria, while 15% were Gram-negative bacteria. The most frequently isolated strains were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (60.4%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.4%). The isolated bacteria showed a significant percentage of resistance to multiple antibiotics. Therefore, the identification of the causal bacteria and antimicrobial sensitivity tests are mandatory to select the effective drug for the treatment of eye infections and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Sialadenitis is a frequent occurrence after radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). However, reports on its predictors and risk factors in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) are scarce. Aim. This study aimed to identify risk factors for early sialadenitis in patients receiving RAI for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. It also aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of such patients receiving RAI at our institution. Methods. This was a retrospective study conducted at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Medical charts were reviewed for all patients 18–79 years of age admitted to receive RAI for DTC between 01/01/2012 and 31/12/2015. Sialadenitis was deemed present if there were any records of neck swelling/pain, dry mouth, or difficulty swallowing within 48 hours of RAI administration. Characteristics between patients with sialadenitis and those without were compared to determine predictors. Results. There were 174 patients admitted to receive RAI, predominantly females (71.3%), with papillary thyroid cancer (93.1%). The majority had lymph node involvement (64.5%). Pretreatment thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was greater than 75 mIU/ml in most patients (72.6%). The prevalence of sialadenitis was 20.1% (95% CI (15–27)). Being non-Lebanese and having a positive whole-body scan were associated with sialadenitis and persisted after adjustments (OR = 2.34 and 3.99). Non-Lebanese patients had higher rates of lymph nodes involvement (p value 0.005) and were kept off levothyroxine for longer periods (p value 0.02). Conclusion. The prevalence of sialadenitis at our institution was similar to other reported studies from the world. However, risk factors allude to more iodine exposure in the neck with positive whole-body scan uptake, lymph node involvement, and prolonged period of hypothyroidism.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shijun Guan</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Liandi Fang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper investigates the finite-time stability problem of p-norm stochastic nonlinear systems subject to output constraint. To cope with the constraint on system output, a tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed. By using the constructed BLF and the backstepping technique, a new control algorithm is proposed with a continuous state-feedback controller being designed, which guarantees not only that the requirement of output constraint is always achieved but also that the origin of the system is finite-time stable. This result is demonstrated by both the rigorous analysis and the simulation example.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. To describe our experience with the use of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) in the treatment of HIV-infected patients in Qatar including both naïve and treatment experienced. We also report the reasons for switching to EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF in treatment-experienced patients, response to treatment, and tolerability. Method. Review of the medical records of the first 100 HIV-infected patients treated with EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF. Results. Among the 100 HIV-infected patients who were treated with EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF, 64 were Qatari and the rest were from other nationalities. 80 patients were males and 20 were females. 29 were treatment naïve, and 71 were treatment experienced. Among treatment-experienced patients, the most common reasons for switch to EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF were safety concerns, followed by regimen simplification and adverse drug reaction of the previous regimen (40%, 14%, and 13%, respectively). Treatment response to EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF leading to undetectable viral load in naïve patients was 69%, and in treatment-experienced patients, it was 83% with an overall response among all patients of 79%. Excluding those who left the country and whose data were not available, the response rate will be 86%. Tolerability was excellent with mild side effects and no discontinuation due to side effects. Conclusion. Experience with the use of EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF in 100 patients with HIV infection in Qatar was favourable both in treatment naïve patients and in those who were treatment experienced with an excellent tolerability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Infective endocarditis (IE) is more common in patients with predisposing cardiac lesions and has many potential complications, including stroke and arterial thromboembolisms. Renal manifestations have an estimated prevalence of ∼20%. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a nephrological emergency manifested by autoimmune-mediated progressive loss of renal function over a relatively short period of time. Here, we report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian male, who presented with speech impairment and was found to have multiple embolic strokes caused by aortic valve IE. His renal function declined rapidly, and his urine sediment featured hematuria and proteinuria. ANCA titer was negative by immunofluorescence (IF); however, the PR3 antibody was elevated. The renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune focally necrotizing glomerulonephritis with the presence of ∼25% cellular crescents. He was initially treated with plasmapheresis and pulse dose steroids. Hemodialysis was initiated for uremic symptoms. After four weeks of antibiotic therapy and with blood cultures remaining negative, he was treated with rituximab. Two months after discharge, his renal function showed improvement, and hemodialysis was discontinued. This case highlights several complications associated with lactobacillus endocarditis including RPGN.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A graph structure is a useful framework to solve the combinatorial problems in various fields of computational intelligence systems and computer science. In this research article, the concept of fuzzy sets is applied to the graph structure to define certain notions of fuzzy graph structures. Fuzzy graph structures can be very useful in the study of various structures, including fuzzy graphs, signed graphs, and the graphs having labeled or colored edges. The notions of the fuzzy graph structure, lexicographic-max product, and degree and total degree of a vertex in the lexicographic-max product are introduced. Further, the proposed concepts are explained through several numerical examples. In particular, applications of the fuzzy graph structures in decision-making process, regarding detection of marine crimes and detection of the road crimes, are presented. Finally, the general procedure of these applications is described by an algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Target detection and segmentation algorithms have long been one of the main research directions in the field of computer vision, especially in the study of sea surface image understanding, these two tasks often need to consider the collaborative work at the same time, which is very high for the computing processor performance requirements. This article aims to study the deep learning sea target detection and segmentation algorithm. This paper uses wavelet transform-based filtering method for speckle noise suppression, deep learning-based method for land masking, and the target detection part uses an improved CFAR cascade algorithm. Finally, the best separable features are selected to eliminate false alarms. In order to further illustrate the feasibility of the scheme, this paper uses measured data and simulation data to verify the scheme and discusses the effect of different signal-to-noise ratio, sea target type, and attitude on the algorithm performance. The research data show that the deep learning sea target detection and segmentation algorithm has good detection performance and is generally applicable to ship target detection of different types and different attitudes. The results show that the deep learning sea target detection and segmentation algorithm fully takes into account the irregular shape and texture of the interfering target detected in the optical remote sensing image so that the accuracy rate is 32.7% higher and the efficiency is increased by about 1.3 times. The deep learning sea target detection is compared with segmentation algorithm, and it has strong target characterization ability and can be applied to ship targets of different scales.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work, the numerical steepest descent path (NSDP) method is proposed to compute the highly oscillatory physical optics (PO) scattered fields from the concave surfaces, including both the monostatic and the bistatic cases. Quadratic variations are adopted to approximate the integrands of the PO type integral into the canonical form. Then, on involving the NSDP method, we deform the integration paths of the integrals into several NSDPs on the complex plain, through which the highly oscillatory integrands are converted to exponentially decay integrands. The RCS results of the PO scattered field are calculated and are compared with the high frequency asymptotic (HFA) method and the brute force (BF) method. The results demonstrate that the proposed NSDP method for calculating PO scattered fields from concave surfaces is frequency-independent and error-controllable. Numerical examples are provided to verify the efficiencies of the NSDP method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of standardized methanolic extracts from seven Ficus deltoidea varieties in inhibiting the formation of AGEs, protein oxidation, and their antioxidant effects. The antiglycation activity was analyzed based on the inhibition of AGEs, fructosamine, and thiol groups level followed by the inhibition of protein carbonyl formation. The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power assay) and total phenolic contents were evaluated. After 28 days of induction, all varieties of Ficus deltoidea extracts significantly restrained the formation of fluorescence AGEs by 4.55–5.14 fold. The extracts also reduced the fructosamine levels by 47.0–86.5%, increased the thiol group levels by 64.3–83.7%, and inhibited the formation of protein carbonyl by 1.36–1.76 fold. DPPH radical scavenging activity showed an IC50 value of 66.81–288.04 μg/ml and reducing power activity depicted at 0.02–0.24 μg/ml. The extent of phenolic compounds present in the extracts ranged from 70.90 to 299.78 mg·GAE/g. Apart from that, correlation studies between the activities were observed. This study revealed that seven varieties of Ficus deltoidea have the potential to inhibit AGEs formation and possess antioxidant activity that might be attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Lijun Liu</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhenyu Wu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>For modern high earth dams, sufficient safety margin is considered in the designs of flood discharge capacity and dam crest elevation to prevent flood overtopping. However, for high earth dams which may induce catastrophic consequences, during their long operational period, extremely hazardous scenarios which could occur and threaten dam safety need to be considered. For the earth dams located in areas with intensive seismicity, there is a possible scenario that the release structures fail due to seismic landslides and gate failures caused by a severe earthquake when the flood begins to enter the reservoir. Thus, it is desirable to investigate the influence of failure duration of release structures on dam overtopping risk. Based on the Bayesian network, a methodology for overtopping risk analysis of earth dams considering effects of failure duration of release structures is proposed. The overtopping risk of the PBG earth-rockfill dam was analyzed to illustrate the methodology. The critical release structures which dominate the dam overtopping risk are identified. The dam overtopping risk is most sensitive to the failure duration of the spillway. The tolerable failure duration of the spillway is approximately 3 days, and when the failure duration of the spillway reaches 4 days, the dam overtopping risk drastically rises to an unacceptable level. The case study suggests that the proposed methodology could be helpful to analyze the influences of possible failure durations of release structures on dam overtopping risk and could facilitate preparation for emergency plans.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, allopathy (ALP) and naturopathy (NAP) have become a favorite topic, source of argument, and the subject discussed when it comes to choosing treatment modality. Various attempts have been made to elucidate this issue, yet limited advancement has been achieved. To this day, the dispute remains active, and the debate over what to do about it continues to damnify us. The presented qualitative analysis aims to identify existing views or else expand on or uncover already known differences. Ourexamination or position is not about the conflict, finding a superior method (ALP vs. NAP), but aims at inductive reasoning, making broader generalizations from scientific observations. Subjects and Methods. We explore the philosophical and psychological foundation of the prevailing ideologies and perspectives in the contemporary society using the Straussian grounded theory approach. The study had no subjects. Results. We outline the path for the future direction. Conclusion. Our examination concludes that it is essential to acknowledge not only the difference between ALP and NAP but also how they both act on our health. We emphasize that, by identifying our perspective, our inner reflection, and our view on this topic, we can undertake a new paradigm, new road to improve our health, and perhaps the well-being throughout our culture and society.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Weiqiang Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the popularization of distributed interactive applications (DIAs), for getting good interactive experience among participants, efficient and fair allocation of network resource should be considered. In software-defined networks, the presence of central controllers provides novel solution to deploy customizable routing for interactive applications, which allows fine-grained resource allocation for DIAs to achieve fairness among participants. But opportunities always come with challenges, the wide spread user locations often require distribution of controllers to meet the requirements of applications. Hence, the latency involved among participants is directly affected by the processing time of controllers. In this context, we address the DIAs’ fair resource provisioning problems on computing and links load with the objective of balancing the achievable request rate and fairness among multiple flows in SDN networks. We firstly formulate the problems as a combination of controller loading and routing optimization. Then, we propose proactive assignment controller algorithm based on deep learning and fairness path allocation algorithm to share the bottleneck links. Compared with the state-of-the-art greedy assignment algorithm and priority order allocating algorithm, the final result is proven to get better fairness on controller and link load among DIAs’ participants by trace driven simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a mixed duopoly dynamic model with bounded rationality is built, where a public-private joint venture and a private enterprise produce homogeneous products and compete in the same market. The purpose of this research is to study the stability and the multistability of the established model. The local stability of all the equilibrium points is discussed by using Jury condition, and the stability region of the Nash equilibrium point has been given. A special fractal structure called “hub of periodicity” has been found in the two-parameter space by numerical simulation. In addition, the phenomena of multistability (also called coexistence of multiple attractors) are also studied using basins of attraction and 1-D bifurcation diagrams with adiabatic initial conditions. We find that there are two different coexistences of multiple attractors. And, the fractal structure of the attracting basin is also analyzed, and the formation mechanisms of “holes” and “contact” bifurcation have been revealed. At last, the long-term profits of the enterprises are studied. We find that some enterprises can even make more profits under a chaotic circumstance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the dyeing performance and antibacterial properties of pomegranate (Punica granatum) peel extracts were investigated, when applied to hemp fabric. A tannin-rich natural dye was extracted using water at 100°C. As the antibacterial agent was sensitive to temperature, it was extracted using Soxhlet apparatus with methanol at 55°C. The color strength (K/S) values were investigated and found to increase in line with the dye concentration, dyeing time, and temperature. Optimal dyeing of the hemp fabric was achieved when applying 6% w/v of extract at 80°C for 60 min. This produced a yellowish-brown appearance. The dyed fabrics were rated as good to excellent for color fastness against washing, water, sea water, and perspiration. The dyed fabrics were next finished with the antibacterial agent extracted from the peel and tested for activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Gram negative), using the AATCC-100 (percentage reduction) test. The fabric was demonstrated to be 99.99% effective against Staphylococcus aureus, and this was conserved across 20 wash cycles.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Zirconia grinding fixtures have been widely used in semiconductor industry to improve the quality and precision of the products. For maximizing the service life and minimizing the risks of accidental damage, it is critical to have a better understanding of the fatigue life of zirconia grinding fixtures. To this end, a boundary element method is developed in this paper to investigate their crack growth and fatigue life. To validate the proposed method, the stress intensity factor of a typical plate structure with initial cracks is considered. On this basis, Paris Law is employed in the boundary element model to further study the crack growth and stress distributions in the zirconia fixture under cyclic loads. Numerical results show that stress concentration occurs at the pillar of the fixture, and crack growth is perpendicular to the loading direction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The immune system against tumors acts through a complex dynamical process showing a dual role. On the one hand, the immune system can activate some immune cells to kill tumor cells (TCs), such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells (NKs), but on the other hand, more evidence shows that some immune cells can help tumor escape, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this paper, we propose a tumor immune interaction model based on Tregs-mediated tumor immune escape mechanism. When helper T cells’ (HTCs) stimulation rate by the presence of identified tumor antigens is below critical value, the coexistence (tumor and immune) equilibrium is always stable in its existence region. When HTCs stimulation rate is higher than the critical value, the inhibition rate of effector cells (ECs) by Tregs can destabilize the coexistence equilibrium and cause Hopf bifurcations and produce a limit cycle. This model shows that Tregs might play a crucial role in triggering the tumor immune escape. Furthermore, we introduce the adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) and monoclonal antibody immunotherapy (MAI) as the treatment to boost the immune system to fight against tumors. The numerical results show that ACI can control TCs more, while MAI can delay the inhibitory effect of Tregs on ECs. The result also shows that the combination of both immunotherapies can control TCs and reduce the inhibitory effect of Tregs better than a single immunotherapy can control.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pregnancies that implant on the uterosacral ligament are rare. Here, we describe a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the left uterosacral ligament in a patient with potential risk factors including possible endometriosis and recent hysteroscopic procedure. A 29-year-old female, para 0, presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain. Pelvic examination was significant for fullness in the posterior cul-de-sac. Laboratory values were significant for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level of 6311 mIU/mL. Sonogram findings were significant for no intrauterine gestation, a 6.9×4.6×4.7 cm3 complex left adnexal mass, and moderate free fluid within the posterior cul-de-sac. The patient underwent laparoscopy, which revealed hemoperitoneum and unremarkable bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries. An abnormal area was noted in the left uterosacral ligament. Tissue was bluntly removed and pathologically confirmed as chorionic villi within the left uterosacral ligament. After one week, her beta-hCG decreased to 784 mIU/mL. After two weeks, she was seen as an outpatient and was doing well without any symptoms. More information is required regarding these unique pregnancies to help understand the pathophysiology and determine the management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Objectives. The atherosclerotic plaque formation is a complex and multifactorial process. A key process underlying the formation of atherosclerotic lesion is extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We chose proteins representing related aspects of ECM remodeling. In this study, we evaluated the plasma concentration and the tissue content of MMP-2 and MMP-9, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and fibronectin (FN) in atheromatous artery wall. We aimed to elucidate if the local changes have systemic reflection and to assess their clinical utility in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Materials and Methods. 20 patients undergoing routine carotid endarterectomy and 40 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. MMPs activity and OPG and FN concentrations were measured in atherosclerotic plaques and nonchanged contiguous tissue after homogenization as well as in plasma from patients and reference group. The activity of MMPs was evaluated by gelatin zymography, and the concentration of OPG and FN was assessed by ELISA. Results. OPG concentration and MMP-9 activity showed differences between plaque and nonchanged tissue; OPG was higher in adjacent tissue P=0.0009, whereas MMP-9 was higher in plaque (proMMP-9 P=0.0003; MMP-9 P&lt;0.0001). The OPG plasma concentration and both MMPs plasma activity were higher in patients (OPG P&lt;0.001; proMMP-2 P=0.0292; and proMMP-9 P=0.0374), while FN plasma concentration was lower in patients than in the reference group P=0.0004. The ROC curves analysis showed the highest AUC for OPG (0.943) with 85.0% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. Conclusions. The atherosclerotic plaque and the contiguous artery wall are biochemically different. OPG shows the highest potential to be a marker of advanced carotid atherosclerosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the truck proportion on surrogate safety measures to explore the relationship between truck proportion and traffic safety. The relationship between truck proportion and traffic flow parameters was analyzed by correlation and partial correlation analysis, and the value of the 85th percentile speed minus the 15th percentile speed (85%V–15%V) and the speed variation coefficient were selected as surrogate safety measures to explore the impact of truck proportion on traffic status. The k-means algorithm and the support vector machine were employed to evaluate traffic status on a freeway under different truck proportions in different periods. The major results are that the relationship between truck proportion and the value of 85%V–15%V and the speed variation coefficient is consistent in different aggregation periods. With increasing truck proportion, the value of 85%V–15%V, as well as the speed variation coefficient, increases initially and then decreases. In addition, the traffic flow status tends to be dangerous when the truck proportion ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 and when the value of 85%V–15%V and the speed variation coefficient are above 42 km/h and 0.223, respectively. While the truck proportion is from 0.1 to 0.3 and from 0.7 to 0.9, the traffic flow is relatively safe on the condition that the value of 85%V–15%V and the speed variation coefficient were under 42 km/h and 0.223, respectively. Therefore, the relationship between truck proportion and traffic safety could be well revealed by two surrogate safety measures, that is, the value of 85%V–15%V and the speed variation coefficient. In addition, the k-means algorithm and the support vector machine can well reveal the impact of truck proportion on traffic safety in different periods. The findings of this study indicate a need for decreasing the disturbance of mixed traffic and the impact of the truck proportion on traffic safety status.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yaxiong Han</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Zhaocheng He</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A crucial task in traffic data analysis is similarity pattern discovery, which is of great importance to urban mobility understanding and traffic management. Recently, a wide range of methods for similarities discovery have been proposed and the basic assumption of them is that traffic data is complete. However, missing data problem is inevitable in traffic data collection process due to a variety of reasons. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian nonparametric tensor decomposition (BNPTD) to achieve incomplete traffic data imputation and similarity pattern discovery simultaneously. BNPTD is a hierarchical probabilistic model, which is comprised of Bayesian tensor decomposition and Dirichlet process mixture model. Furthermore, we develop an efficient variational inference algorithm to learn the model. Extensive experiments were conducted on a smart card dataset collected in Guangzhou, China, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods. It should be noted that the proposed BNPTD is universal and can also be applied to other spatiotemporal traffic data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents an improved clustering algorithm for categorizing data with arbitrary shapes. Most of the conventional clustering approaches work only with round-shaped clusters. This task can be accomplished by quickly searching and finding clustering methods for density peaks (DPC), but in some cases, it is limited by density peaks and allocation strategy. To overcome these limitations, two improvements are proposed in this paper. To describe the clustering center more comprehensively, the definitions of local density and relative distance are fused with multiple distances, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and shared-nearest neighbors (SNN). A similarity-first search algorithm is designed to search the most matching cluster centers for noncenter points in a weighted KNN graph. Extensive comparison with several existing DPC methods, e.g., traditional DPC algorithm, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), affinity propagation (AP), FKNN-DPC, and K-means methods, has been carried out. Experiments based on synthetic data and real data show that the proposed clustering algorithm can outperform DPC, DBSCAN, AP, and K-means in terms of the clustering accuracy (ACC), the adjusted mutual information (AMI), and the adjusted Rand index (ARI).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cutaneous metastases are unusual presenting symptoms of lung cancer. Therefore, they are prone to be misdiagnosed and missed. The report describes a case of a forty-nine-year-old female with painful zosteriform rashes showing multiple vesicle-like papules localized on the left breast for 10 days. The patient had been diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma at the department of oncology one year ago. Skin biopsy revealed blue nodular lesions in the dermis, composed of clustered heterogeneous tumor cells with glandular formation. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Adult penile lymphangioma (APL) is a rare multifactorial vascular malformation. Usually, it is asymptomatic and located on the coronal sulcus or shaft of the penis. It is benign in nature with rare chances of recurrence. APLs can be approached via various modalities from simple “watch and wait” to electrofulguration, laser ablation, and surgical excision. We report a rare variant of lymphangioma of the penis inculcating the shaft being excised surgically with favorable outcome along with brief review of literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the present research, the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum YS4 (LP-YS4) on colitis were tested in an oxazolone-induced mouse model. BALB/c mice were induced by oxazolone and then treated with LP-YS4. The serum levels of mice were analyzed using commercial kits and the protein and mRNA expression levels of mouse colon tissue were detected by Western blotting and qPCR assay, respectively. The results demonstrated that LP-YS4 significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the colon length and ratio of colon weight/length in mice with colitis and attenuated the negative effects of colitis. The results also showed that treatment with LP-YS4 significantly reduced the serum concentrations of ET-1, SP, and IL-10 while significantly increasing those of SS, VIP, and IL-2 in colitis mice (P&lt;0.05). In addition, LP-YS4 significantly increased the activities of GSH and SOD while decreasing those of MPO and MDA in the colon tissue of colitis mice (P&lt;0.05). LP-YS4 also significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of c-Kit, eNOS, nNOSe, and SCF in colitis mice while significantly downregulating the relative expression of iNOS. In summary, LP-YS4 could reduce the negative effects of colitis, and such effects were better than those of the common probiotic Lactobacillus bulgaricus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Neuroinflammation plays an important pathological role in experimental surgical brain injury (SBI). Apoptotic associated with phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization promotes anti-inflammatory mediator TGF-β1 release. In the present study, we investigated the anti-neuroinflammation effect of PS liposome or isoflurane pretreatment via PS/CD36/TGF-β1 signaling in a rat model of SBI. A total of 120 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 280-330 gms) were used. SBI was induced by partial right frontal lobe corticotomy. Intranasal PS liposome or isoflurane inhalation was administered prior to SBI induction. CD36 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was administered intracerebroventricularly. Recombinant Annexin V protein (rAnnexin V) was delivered intranasally. Post-SBI assessments included neurological tests, brain water content, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Endogenous CD36 protein levels but not TGF-β1 was significantly increased within peri-resection brain tissues over 72 h after SBI. SBI rats were associated with increased brain water content surrounding corticotomy and neurological deficits. PS liposome pretreatment significantly reduced brain water content and improved some neurological deficits at 24 hours and 72 hours after SBI. PS liposome increased CD36 and TGF-β1 protein levels, but decreased IL-1β and TNFα protein levels in peri-resection brain tissues at 24 hours after SBI. CD36 siRNA or rAnnexin V partially countered the protective effect of PS liposome. Isoflurane pretreatment produced similar antineuroinflammation and neurological benefits in SBI rats partially by upregulating CD36/Lyn/TGF-β1 signaling. Collectively, our findings suggest that the activation of PS/CD36/TGF-β1 pathway by PS liposome or isoflurane prior to SBI could attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurological outcomes in rats. PS liposome or isoflurane pretreatment may serve as an effective preventive strategy to minimize the brain injury caused by neurosurgical procedures in patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is involved in various neuronal diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. We have previously reported that glutamate attenuated the survival signaling of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in cultured cortical neurons, which is viewed as a novel mechanism of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. However, the phosphorylation sites of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) affected by glutamate remain to be elucidated, and importantly, which subtype of NMDARs plays a major role in attenuating the prosurvival effect of IGF-1 is still unknown. In the present study, glutamate was found to attenuate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the prosurvival effect of IGF-1 in primary cultured cortical neurons. NMDAR inhibitors, MK801 and AP-5, blocked the inhibitory effect of glutamate on the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and increased cell survival, while DNQX, LY341495, and CPCCOEt had no effect. Interestingly, we found that glutamate decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1131, 1135/1136, 1250/1251, and 1316, while it had no effect on tyrosine 950 in cortical neurons. Moreover, using specific antagonists and siRNA to downregulate individual NMDAR subunits, we found that the activation of NR2B-containing NMDARs was essential for glutamate to inhibit IGF-1 signaling. These findings indicate that the glutamate-induced attenuation of IGF-1 signaling is mediated by NR2B-containing NMDARs. Our study also proposes a novel mechanism of altering neurotrophic factor signaling by the activation of NMDARs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) after bypass surgery for moyamoya disease (MMD) mainly results from redistribution of blood flow, which leads to poor outcomes, while effective methods to predict HPS are still lacking. Indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography can assess regional cerebral blood flow changes semiquantitatively with the application of FLOW 800 software. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the intraoperative evaluation of local hemodynamic changes around anastomotic sites using FLOW 800 videoangiography mapping can predict the incidence of HPS and clinical outcomes. Methods. Of the patients who were diagnosed with MMD in our hospital between August 2018 and December 2019, who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgeries, we investigated 65 hemispheres (in 62 patients) in which intraoperative ICG analysis was performed using FLOW 800 (Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany) to evaluate the local cerebral hemodynamics before and after anastomosis. Regions of interest were set at more than 2 points on the brain surface according to the location and situation of recipient arteries in the surgical area. Peak cerebral blood volume (CBV), regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), and time to peak (TTP) were calculated from the selected points. As the data were available intraoperatively, anastomoses were performed in a suitable area. According to the occurrence of HPS, patients were divided into the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, from which hemodynamic parameters were compared. Furthermore, ROC analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of change rates in CBV, CBF, and TTP (i.e., ΔCBV, ΔCBF, and ΔTTP) for predicting HPS. Results. Data from the 62 patients were analyzed, and all patients were closely assessed during hospitalization after the procedures. The values of ΔCBV and ΔCBF were significantly higher in the symptomatic group (p&lt;0.01), while ΔTTP is slightly lower in the symptomatic group with no statistical differences (p=0.72). Hemodynamic parameters including ΔCBV and ΔCBF, calculated by FLOW 800, had high sensitivity and specificity according to the ROC curve (ΔCBV: AUC=0.743, 95% CI, 0.605–0.881, p=0.002; ΔCBF: AUC=0.852, 95% CI, 0.750–0.954, p&lt;0.01), which could be used as predictors for HPS. Conclusions. Intraoperative ICG-FLOW 800 videoangiography mapping is a safe method which can reflect hemodynamic characteristics in the surgical area for MMD, the findings of which correlate with the occurrence of HPS. Parameters including ΔCBV and ΔCBF are proven to be efficient in the prediction of HPS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hypertension, central obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia are key risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, the specific factors contributing to the development of unfavorable cardiometabolic characteristics in children with obesity are unknown. In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional relationships between cytokines, irisin, and fatty acid (FA) composition in plasma in school-age children with metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity (MHO and MUO, respectively) of the same age and body mass index and waist circumference percentiles. We compared the data with that of children with normal weight (NW). We found that inflammatory cytokines and low irisin plasma concentrations are associated with obesity but not with cardiometabolic risk (CMR). Lipid profiles showed that children with MUO have a distinctive FA profile compared with children with MHO and NW, whereas children with MHO shared 88% of the FA profile with the NW group. Among all FAs, concentration of myristic acid (14 : 0), arachidic acid (20 : 0), and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) was higher in children with MHO, whereas n-6 PUFAs such as arachidonic acid (20 : 4n6) had a significant contribution in defining MUO. These data suggest that the plasma FA profile is not only a central link to obesity but also may act as an indicator of CMR presence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bacterial infections are on a rise with causal-resistant strains increasing the economic burden to both patients and healthcare providers. Salons are recently reported as one of the sources for transmission of such resistant bacterial strains. The current study aimed at the identification of the prevalent bacteria and characterization of quaternary ammonium compound (qac) genes from disinfectant-resistant S. aureus isolated from salon tools in Ishaka town, Bushenyi District of Uganda. A total of 125 swabs were collected from different salon tools (combs, brushes, scissors, clippers, and shaving machines), and prevalent bacteria were isolated using standard microbiological methods. Identification of isolated bacteria was done using standard phenotypic methods including analytical profile index (API). Susceptibility patterns of the isolated bacteria to disinfectant were determined using the agar well diffusion method. Quaternary ammonium compound (qac) genes (qacA/B and qacC) associated with disinfectant resistances were detected from disinfectant-resistant S. aureus using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing methods. Of the 125 swab samples collected from salons, 78 (62.4%) were contaminated with different bacteria species. Among the salon tools, clippers had the highest contamination of 20 (80.0%), while shaving machines had the lowest contamination of 11 (44.0%). The most prevalent bacteria identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28.1%) followed by S. aureus (26.5%). Of all the disinfectants tested, the highest resistance was shown with sodium hypochlorite 1%. Out of the eight (8) disinfectant-resistant S. aureus analysed for qac genes, 2 (25%) isolates (STP6 and STP9) were found to be qacA/B positive, while 2 (25%) isolates (STP8 and STP9) were found to be qacC gene positive. This study has shown that bacterial contamination of salon tools is common, coupled with resistance to disinfectants with sodium hypochlorite resistance being more common. Furthermore, observed resistance was attributed to the presence of qac genes among S. aureus isolates. A search for qac genes for disinfectant resistance from other bacteria species is recommended.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study aimed to characterize the susceptibility profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. clinical isolates to polymyxin B in a public hospital in Recife-PE, Brazil, between the years of 2018 and 2019, as well as to search for the presence of the mcr-1 gene and evaluate the interaction between polymyxin B and usnic acid against these isolates. The strains were identified using the BD Phoenix™ automated system and the agar-spot test was used to determine the susceptibility profile to polymyxin B. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of usnic acid and polymyxin B were determined through the broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Subsequently, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the mcr-1 gene in the isolates. The interaction between usnic acid and polymyxin B was evaluated by the Checkerboard assay. Among 34 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 26.5% (9/34) were positive for the polymyxin B agar-spot test, and 11.8% (4/34) presented an intermediate susceptibility (MIC = 4 μg/mL), while 14.7% (5/34) presented antimicrobial resistance with MIC values ranging from 8 to 32 μg/mL. Among 38 isolates of Acinetobacter spp., 13.2% (5/38) were positive for the polymyxin B agar-spot test and all of them were resistant to polymyxin B with a MIC value &gt; 32 μg/mL. The mcr-1 gene was not detected in the clinical isolates. Regarding usnic acid, it presented a moderate antibacterial activity against two P. aeruginosa isolates (MIC = 250 μg/mL) and no activity was detected against the others. A synergistic effect between usnic acid and polymyxin B was observed against three clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa which were resistant to polymyxin B (FICI ≤ 0.5). Therefore, it was possible to observe that usnic acid is a promising candidate to be used in combination with polymyxin B against infections caused by resistant P. aeruginosa.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The identification method of backpropagation (BP) neural network is adopted to approximate the mapping relation between input and output of neurons based on neural firing trajectory in this paper. In advance, the input and output data of neural model is used for BP neural network learning, so that the identified BP neural network can present the transfer characteristics of the model, which makes the network precisely predict the firing trajectory of the neural model. In addition, the method is applied to identify electrophysiological experimental data of real neurons, so that the output of the identified BP neural network can not only accurately fit the neural firing trajectories of neurons participating in the network training but also predict the firing trajectories and spike moments of neurons which are not involved in the training process with high accuracy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The linear jet propulsion system, unlike pump-jets which are widely used in underwater bodies, is installed inside a tunnel under the vessel and can be used for high-speed crafts, tugs, and service boats. However, this system has not received adequate attention by researchers, which is the subject of the current study. In the present paper, hydrodynamic performance of the linear jet propulsion system is numerically investigated. Accordingly, the Ansys-CFX software is utilized and RANS equations are solved using the SST turbulent model. The results of the proposed numerical model, in the form of thrust and torque coefficient as well as efficiency, are compared with available experimental data for a ducted propeller, and good compliance is achieved. Considering the importance of stator cross section on the performance of the linear jet propulsion system, the influence of thickness and camber size of the stator on linear jet propulsion systems are examined. Based on the numerical findings, it is determined that at constant advance ratio, with increasing thickness of stator, the efficiency increases. It is also observed that as the span length increases, the maximum and minimum of the pressure coefficient increase for different thicknesses. Furthermore, it is seen that positive and negative pressure coefficients decrease with an increase in foil thickness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major polyphenolic compound present in green tea and is generally regarded as an effective antioxidant. However, its chemical reactivity makes it susceptible to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via autooxidation and exhibit prooxidant effects. The prooxidant actions of EGCG could play a dual role, being both beneficial and harmful. This review summarized recent research progress on (1) the anticancer, antiobesity, and antibacterial effects of EGCG and (2) the possible toxicity of EGCG. The major focus is on the involvement of prooxidant effects of EGCG and their effective doses used. Considering dosage is a crucial factor in the prooxidant effects of EGCG; further studies are required to find the appropriate dose at which EGCG could bring more health benefits with lower toxicity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the child’s first six months to achieve optimal growth, development, and health. Even though appropriate feeding practice is the most cost-effective intervention to reduce child morbidity and mortality, exclusive breastfeeding practices in developing countries are still low. Objective. The objective of the study was to assess exclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among mothers in West Shoa zone. Methods. Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from May to December 2018 in the West Shoa zone, Ethiopia, among 710 mothers with 6–9-month-old infants. The multistage stage sampling technique was employed. A pretested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Epi Info version 7.1.2.0 was used to enter the data, and we transferred to SPSS version 25 for analysis. The association between factors and the exclusive breastfeeding were analyzed with bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Result. A total of 710 women were included with a response rate of 97.9%. The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was 38.7%, and only 65.35% of the respondents reported that they have exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their infant’s life. Marital status (AOR 2.467 (1.333–4.564)), ANC visit (AOR 2.562 (1.250–5.252)), pregnancy intentionality (AOR 4.727 (3.217–6.945)), postnatal care clinic attendance (AOR 3.373 (2.293–4.963)), and counseling on exclusive breastfeeding AOR 2.544 (1.239–5.225) were the factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding practice is still low and actions need to be taken like educating the community about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding using every accessible media. Maternal health service centers should provide counseling and education for women about breastfeeding.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we present a generalized SOR-like iteration method to solve the non-Hermitian positive definite linear complementarity problem (LCP), which is obtained by reformulating equivalently the implicit fixed-point equation of the LCP as a two-by-two block nonlinear equation. The convergence properties of the generalized SOR-like iteration method are discussed under certain conditions. Numerical experiments show that the generalized SOR-like method is efficient, compared with the SOR-like method and the modulus-based SOR method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Since the first reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to other parts of China and across the world. Although a few studies have assessed the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the changes in clinical characteristics during disease progression remain unclear. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 62 patients who died from COVID-19 at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 26 and February 17, 2020. We compared the clinical features on admission and at the last follow-up before death. Results. Of the 62 patients with COVID-19, 41 (66%) patients were male, and 21 (34%) were female. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range (IQR), 54-88), and 45 (72.5%) patients had preexisting conditions. The median time from symptom onset to the first visit at the clinic was three days, while the median time from symptom onset to death was 18.5 days. During disease progression, the amounts of arterial gases worsened, and liver, renal, and heart dysfunction was observed. Due to the cytokine storm, infection-related biomarkers, including lactic acid, C-reactive protein, and interleukine-6, gradually worsened during hospitalization. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that during hospitalization, many COVID-19 patients experienced multiple organ dysfunction and cytokine storm. The time from symptom onset to death was only 18.5 days, highlighting the disease’s rapid progression. The better understanding of the clinical changes during disease progression might provide further insight into the COVID-19 pathophysiology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hypertensive white matter lesion (WML) is one of common causes of vascular cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of rosuvastatin on cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanisms in chronic hypertensive rats. From the 8th week after establishment of stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSPs), rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg) or saline as a control was administrated once daily for consecutive 12 weeks by gastric gavage. Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test. WML was observed by Luxol fast blue staining. Aβ deposits, Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1 were determined by immunofluorescence. After rosuvastatin treatment, the escape latencies were decreased and the time of crossing the hidden platform was increased in the Morris water maze, compared with the vehicle-treated RHRSP group. In a novel object recognition test, the recognition index in the rosuvastatin-treated RHRSP group was significantly larger than that in the vehicle-treated RHRSP group. Rosuvastatin treatment presented with the effects of lower WML grades, higher expression of tight junction proteins Claudin-5, Occludin, and ZO-1 in the corpus callosum, and less Aβ deposits in the cortex and hippocampus. The data suggested that rosuvastatin improved the cognitive function of chronic hypertensive rats partly by attenuating WML and reducing Aβ burden.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coal seam gas is a critical substance because it can be a source of a large quantity of clean energy as well as a dangerous source of risk. A pressure relief gas drainage is an effective and widely used method for coal seam gas recovery and gas disaster control in coal mines. A series of pressure relief gas drainage experiments were conducted using large-scale coal samples under different unloading stress paths in this study to explore the unloading stress paths. From the experimental results, the dynamic evolutions of gas pressure, coal temperature, and gas production were analyzed. The trends of gas pressure and coal temperature during pressure relief gas drainage were similar: dropping rapidly first and then slowly with time. Correspondingly, gas production was fast in the early stage of pressure relief gas drainage and became stable thereafter. Meanwhile, gas flow characteristics were significantly affected by the unloading stress paths. Gas pressure and coal temperature had the maximum descent by unloading stress in three directions simultaneously, and the unloading stress of the Z direction had the minimal impact when only unloading in one direction of stress. However, the influence of unloading stress paths on gas production was complex and time dependent. The difference coefficient parameter was proposed to characterize the influence degree of unloading stress paths on the pressure relief gas drainage effect. Eventually, the selection of unloading stress path under different situations was discussed based on time, which is expected to provide the basis for pressure relief gas drainage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To improve the high-temperature rutting resistance of asphalt pavements, an inverted asphalt pavement structure (IAPS), 4 cm AC-13 mixture + 8 cm AC-25 mixture + 6 cm AC-20 mixture + 54 cm cement-stabilized macadam, was proposed herein by considering engineering practice, theoretical calculation, and analysis. A rutting prediction equation of asphalt pavements was then proposed via rut-development trends found by laboratory 18 cm thick rutting test. Subsequently, the rutting resistance of the IAPS was evaluated. The results show that, compared with the traditional asphalt pavement structure (TAPS), 4 cm AC-13 mixture + 6 cm AC-20 mixture + 8 cm AC-25 mixture + 54 cm cement-stabilized macadam, the maximum shear stress of the IAPS can be reduced by ∼1.7% along with improvements in rutting resistance by ∼16% and ∼12% under wheel loads of 0.7 and 1.2 MPa, respectively. Wheel-load increase affects the rutting resistance of both structures in a similar manner: when the wheel load increases from 0.7 MPa to 1.2 MPa, the rut depths of both pavement structures increase by at least 63%. The IAPS clearly has better rutting resistance than the TAPS and is thus the better choice for asphalt pavement structure design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the reasonable construction sequence of an overlapping tunnel shield is investigated. Taking the overlapping tunnel of Tianjin Metro Line 5 as the background, a three-dimensional numerical model was established using Flac3D software to study the influence of the “first up and then down” and “first down and then up” construction sequences of the overlapping tunnel on the surface settlement, stratum displacement, lining radial stress, and displacement. The research results show that the shape and width of the final settlement tank on the ground under the two conditions are basically the same, and the difference between the maximum cumulative settlements is small. The accumulated ground settlement caused by the first up and then down construction sequence is 1.8 mm larger than that caused by the first down and then up sequence. The difference between the two working conditions on the vertical displacement of the stratum mainly occurs in the middle stratum of the upper and lower tunnels, and the proportion of the strata in the uplifted state and subsidence state is different. The construction sequence has little effect on the radial stress on the lining of the upper and lower tunnels. Under these two conditions, the excavation of the second tunnel causes a small change in the radial stress of the preceding tunnel lining, both within 4.2%. Under the working condition of first down and then up, the construction of the second tunnel causes the lining of the preceding tunnel to rise by 7.2∼9.2 mm. Under the condition of first up and then down, the construction of the second tunnel causes the lining of the preceding tunnel to sink again by 9.1∼10.4 mm. By comparing the effects of the two working conditions on the stratum and the tunnel lining, it is recommended that the construction be carried out in the order of first down and then up.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The biomarkers commonly utilized in diagnostic evaluations of kidney disease suffer from low sensitivity, especially in the early stages of renal damage. On the other hand, obtaining a renal biopsy to augment clinical decision making can lead to potentially serious complications. In order to overcome the shortcomings of currently available diagnostic tools, recent studies suggest that exosomes, cell-secreted extracellular vesicles containing a large array of active molecules to facilitate cell-to-cell communication, may represent a rich source of novel disease biomarkers. Because of their endocytic origin, exosomes carry markers typical for their parent cells, which could permit the localization of biochemical cellular alterations in specific kidney compartments. Different types of exosomes can be isolated from noninvasively obtained biofluids; however, in the context of kidney disease, evidence has emerged on the role of urinary exosomes in the diagnostic and predictive modeling of renal pathology. The current review summarizes the potential application of exosomes in the detection of acute and chronic inflammatory, metabolic, degenerative, and genetic renal diseases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have been implicated in the development and differentiation of the immune cells. FOXO3 plays a crucial role in physiologic and pathologic immune response. FOXO3, cooperatively with FOXO1, control the development and function of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). Since the lack of Treg-mediated control has fundamental impact on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) development, we investigated FOXO3 expression in patients with T1DM. FOXO3 expression was estimated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from newly diagnosed T1DM pediatric patients (n=28) and age-matched healthy donors (n=27) by reahavel-time PCR and TaqMan gene expression assays. Expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of FOXO3 in T1DM (P=0.0005). Stratification of the T1DM group according to the presence of initial diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) did not indicate differences in FOXO3 expression in patients with DKA compared to a mild T1DM onset (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, overexpression of FOXO3 is correlated with the ongoing islet autoimmune destruction and might suggest a potential role for this gene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been the most popular tool for providing positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information. Some methods have been developed for enhancing the GNSS performance in signal challenging environments (urban canyon, dense foliage, signal blockage, multipath, and none-line-of-sight signals). Vector Tracking Loop (VTL) was recognized as the most promising and prospective one among these technologies, since VTL realized mutual aiding between channels. However, momentary signal blockage from part of the tracking channels affected the VTL operation and the navigation solution estimation. Moreover, insufficient available satellites employed would lead to the navigation solution errors diverging quickly over time. Short-time or temporary signal blockage was common in urban areas. Aiming to improve the VTL performance during the signal outage, in this paper, the deep learning method was employed for assisting the VTL navigation solution estimation; more specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) was employed to aid the VTL navigation filter (navigation filter was usually a Kalman filter). LSTM-RNN obtained excellent performance in time-series data processing; therefore, in this paper, the LSTM-RNN was employed to predict the navigation filter innovative sequence values during the signal outage, and then, the predicted innovative values were employed to aid the navigation filter for navigation solution estimation. The LSTM-RNN was well trained while the signal was normal, and the past innovative sequence was employed as the input of the LSTM-RNN. A simulation was designed and conducted based on an open-source Matlab GNSS software receiver; a dynamic trajectory with several temporary signal outages was designed for testing the proposed method. Compared with the conventional VTL, the LSTM-RNN-assisted VTL could keep the horizontal positioning errors within 50 meters during a signal outage. Also, conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) were compared with the LSTM-RNN method; LSTM-RNN-assisted VTL could maintain the positioning errors less than 20 meters during the outages, which demonstrated LSTM-RNN was superior to the SVM and RBF-NN in these applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To explore multiscale integrated analysis methods in identifying key regulators of esophageal cancer (ESCA). Methods. We downloaded the ESCA dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, which contained RNA-seq data, miRNA-seq data, methylation data, and clinical phenotype information. Then, we combined ESCA-related genes from the NCBI-GENE and OMIM databases and RNA-seq dataset from TCGA to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Meanwhile, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and genes with differential methylation levels were identified. The pivot–module pairs were established using the RAID v2.0 database and TRRUST v2 database. Next, the multifactor-regulated functional network was constructed based on the above information. Additionally, gene corresponding targeted drug information was obtained from the DrugBank database. Moreover, we further screened regulators by assessing their diagnostic value and prognostic value, especially the value of distinguishing patients at TNM I stage from normal patients. In addition, the external database from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used for validation. Lastly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the potential biological functions of key regulators. Results. Our study indicated that CXCL8, CYP2C8, and E2F1 had excellent diagnostic and prognostic values, which may be potential regulators of ESCA. At the same time, the good early diagnosis ability of the three regulators also provided new insights for the diagnosis and early treatment of ESCA patients. Conclusion. We develop a multiscale integrated analysis and suggest that CXCL8, CYP2C8, and E2F1 are promising regulators with good diagnostic and prognostic values in ESCA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The endoscopic transethmoidal approach is favored for the lack of external scars, a wide field of view, and rapid recovery time. But the effect of iatrogenic trauma should not be ignored due to the removal of the uncinate process and anterior and posterior ethmoidal sinus. Anatomically, the optic nerve is close to the sphenoid sinus and Onodi cell. In order to preserve the uncinate process and ethmoidal sinus, we perform endoscopic transsphenoidal optic canal decompression (ETOCD), which is less invasive. However, the anatomy of sphenoid sinus is quite variable, and the anatomical landmarks are rare. Therefore, identifying the position of optic canal is particularly important during surgery. To solve this, we use a postprocessing technique to identify the position of the optic nerve and internal carotid artery on the sphenoid sinus wall. Our results find that VA in 13 patients improved, with a total improve rate of 59.1%. No serious complications were found. We also found that the length of optic canal is different and the medial wall of the optic canal was the longest (p&lt;0.05). The middle section of the optic canal is the narrowest, which was significantly different from cranial mouth and orbital mouth (p&lt;0.05). We assumed that decompression may not require removal of all medial wall. If we remove the length of the shortest wall on the medial wall of the optic canal, the compression may be relieved. Thus, ETOCD was a feasible, safe, effective, and less-invasive approach for patients with TON. The CT postprocessing imaging facilitated recognition of the optic canal during surgery. The decompression length of the medial wall may not need to be completely removed, especially near the cranial mouth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1) has been identified as cancer-related protein. CTHRC1 expresses mainly in adventitial fibroblasts and neointimal smooth muscle cells of balloon-injured vessels and promotes cell migration and tissue repair in response to injury. CTHRC1 plays a pivotal role in some pathophysiological processes, including increasing bone mass, preventing myelination, and reversing collagen synthesis in many tumor cells. The ascended expression of CTHRC1 is related to tumorigenesis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in various human malignancies, including gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, keloid, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and melanoma. And molecules that regulate the expression of CTHRC1 include miRNAs, lncRNAs, WAIF1, and DPAGT1. Many reports have pointed that CTHRC1 could exert different effects through several signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Wnt, integrin β/FAK, Src/FAK, MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/ERK, HIF-1α, and PKC-δ/ERK signaling pathways. As a participant in tissue remodeling or immune response, CTHRC1 may promote early-stage cancer. Several recent studies have identified CTHRC1 as an effectual prognostic biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence or metastasis. It is worth noting that CTHRC1 has different cellular localization and mechanisms of action in different cells and different microenvironments. In this article, we focus on the advances in the signaling pathways mediated by CTHRC1 in tumors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. The aim of the study was to determine the quantitative and qualitative surface structure of contemporary RBCs in posterior teeth reconstructions: regular viscosity bulk fill and conventional composites, obtained after two-stage polishing procedure. Materials and Methods. Four conventional nanohybrid composites (Tetric EvoCeram, GrandioSO, Filtek Z550, and Ceram·X Mono) and four regular viscosity bulk fill composites (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill, X-tra fil, Filtek Bulk Fill Posterior, and QuixFil) were tested. Samples of each RBC were prepared using PMMA cylindrical mold. After two-step polishing procedure, a surface geometry was evaluated under profilometry (Turbowave v. 7.36, Hommel-Etamic) and SEM (VEGA 3, Tescan Analytics). To evaluate differences between values, the following nonparametric tests were used: Friedman’s ANOVA, Wilcoxon’s matched-pair test, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U. Results. All conventional RBCs showed Ra values in the range of 0.20-0.26 μm. Bulk fill showed higher values in range of 0.49-1.36 μm except for Filtek Bulk Fill Posterior, which achieved 0.23 μm Ra value. SEM images of conventional RBCs were described as smooth surfaces with slight damage except for TEC, which presented smooth surface with no damage. Bulk fill composites showed rough surface, except for TBF, which presented smooth surface with slight damage. Conclusions. Regular viscosity bulk fill composites do not constitute a homogeneous group regarding surface roughness after polishing. They obtain, for the most part, poorer smoothness values after polishing than conventional RBCs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Flaws and discontinuities play a crucial role in the failure process of rocks. To investigate the fracturing mechanism of rock with combined flaws composed of crack and hole, the digital image correlation (DIC) method is used to record and analyze the rock failure behavior. Coupled static and dynamic loads are applied on granite specimens with prefabricated flaws by a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) device. The dynamic mechanical properties of the granite specimens are affected by the flaw inclinations with the loading directions. With the inclination angle increasing, the combined strength and peak strain both decrease first and then increase. Full- and local-field strain evolution of the granite specimens is analyzed in a quantitative way by using DIC technique. The specimens with a flaw angle of 45° are broken relatively evenly with homogenous small particle sizes. The variation trend of fragment sizes is consistent with that of combined strength and absorption energy of the specimens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rock destruction under high-temperature conditions is a key issue for nuclear waste treatment projects, underground coal gasification, and improvement of the use of geothermal energy for heating. Therefore, in this study, various methods and techniques were integrated to study the changes in mechanical properties, mineral composition, and microscopic fracture characteristics of Sichuan sandstone treated at 600°C. First, the fracture toughness and indirect tensile strength of untreated sandstones and high-temperature treated sandstones were tested by the MTS testing machine, and the double-K model (DKFM) was used to estimate the unstable fracture toughness. Then, the diffraction spectra of sandstone were analyzed with an X-ray diffractometer to determine the mineral composition change after heat treatment. Finally, the microscopic features of sandstone were observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope. The results show the following. (1) There is no significant change in the tensile strength and fracture toughness of Sichuan sandstone treated at 600°C. (2) The brittleness of Sichuan sandstone decreases and the ductility increases after high-temperature treatment. (3) The unstable fracture toughness value Kun obtained by the double-K model (DKFM) is significantly larger than the apparent fracture toughness value Kif. (4) After treatment at 600°C, the clay minerals in the sandstone changed significantly. Kaolinite is dehydroxylated to metakaolinite, which may increase the ductility of the rock.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a modular hydromechanical approach to assess the short- and long-term surface drainage behavior of arbitrarily deformable asphalt pavements. The modular approach consists of three steps. In the first step, the experimental characterization of the thermomechanical asphalt material behavior is performed. In the second step, information about the long-term material behavior of the asphalt mixtures is integrated on the structural scale via a finite element (FE) tire-pavement model for steady-state rolling conditions and time homogenization in order to achieve a computationally efficient long-term prediction of inelastic deformations of the pavement surface (rut formation). In the third step, information regarding the current pavement geometry (deformed pavement surface) is used to carry out a surface drainage analysis to predict, e.g., the thickness of the water film or the water depth in the pavement ruts as a function of several influencing quantities. For chosen numerical examples, the influence of road geometry (cross and longitudinal slope), road surface (mean texture depth and state of rut deformation), and rainfall properties (rain intensity and duration) on the pavement surface drainage capacity is assessed. These parameters are strongly interrelated, and general statements are not easy to find. Certain trends, however, have been identified and are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The precise mechanism about drug resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has not yet been completely understood. Based on the expression of CD44 and CD133, two well-recognized cell surface markers for CSC identification, we tried to separate HCT8 colorectal cancer cells into different subpopulations and then investigated how the expression of CD44 and CD133 associated with doxorubicin (DXR) resistance. Interestingly, DXR resistance was observed in CD44+CD133+ (P&lt;0.01vs. all other subpopulations), but not in CD44+CD133- cells. CD44+CD133+ cells also showed an enhanced expression of ABCB1 and drug efflux ability (P&lt;0.001vs. all other subpopulations), but verapamil, an inhibitor of ABCB1, only partially mitigated the DXR resistance. Independent on the accumulation of DXR, lower level of reactive oxygen species and higher expression of Nrf2 were detected in CD44+CD133+ than CD44+CD133- cells (P&lt;0.05). Unexpectedly, silencing CD133 by siRNA only partially enhanced the cytotoxicity of DXR, but did not obviously change the expression of ABCB1 and the accumulation of DXR in CD44+CD133+ cells. Complex mechanisms, including drug excretion and redox regulation, are likely involved in the DXR resistance of CD133-positive cells, suggesting the difficulty of drug resistance problem in cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Purpose. Following the new directives of the European Union, which foresee the amalgam ban, the debate on its hypothetical toxicity has started again. So, the aim of this systematic review is to definitively evaluate the eventual effects of the exposure to Hg in adults and children with and without dental amalgam fillings measuring the Hg concentration in various biological fluids. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (Ovid via PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL) including all available randomised controlled trials published in the last 15 years comparing the use of dental amalgam with composite resins in humans with a follow-up period of at least one year. The primary outcome was the Hg concentration in biological fluids (urine, hair, blood, and saliva) with the aim of assessing their reliability as biomarkers of Hg exposure. The risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the overall quality of evidence through the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. The results of the meta-analysis were expressed using a random-effects model, and their power was assessed through the trial sequential analysis (TSA). Results. From the initial 2555 results, only 6 publications were included in the review: five were considered as having high risk of bias, whereas one as having moderate risk. Only two articles were eligible for quantitative analysis. The meta-analysis gathered data from 859 patients but was nevertheless not significant (p = 0.12). The TSA confirmed this evidence revealing that it was due to a lack of statistical power since the required information size (RIS) threshold is not reached. Conclusions. The existing evidence revealed that there are not enough data to support the hypothesis that restorations with dental amalgam can cause nephrotoxicity when compared with composite resins restorations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Flutter is one of the most serious wind-induced vibration phenomena for long-span bridges and may cause the collapse of a bridge (e.g., the Old Tacoma Bridge, 1940). The selection and optimization of flutter aerodynamic measures are difficult in wind tunnel tests. It usually takes a long time and consumes more experimental materials. This paper presents a quick assessment and design optimization method for the flutter stability of a typical flat box girder of the long-span bridges. Numerical analysis could provide a reference for wind tunnel tests and improve the efficiency of the test process. Based on the modal energy exchange in the flutter microvibration process, the global energy input and local energy input are analyzed to investigate the vibration suppression mechanism of a flat steel box girder with an upper central stabilizer. Based on the comparison between the experimental and numerical data, a quick assessment method for the optimization work is proposed. It is practical to predict the effects of flutter suppression measures by numerical analysis. Thus, a wind tunnel test procedure for flutter aerodynamic measures is proposed which could save time and experimental materials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has greatly impacted healthcare systems and society more generally around the world. The management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has primarily impacted emergency departments, medical teams, and intensive care units. However, the impact on health systems as a whole, including surgical specialties, has been wide ranging. We aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on the number and characteristics of general surgical patients reviewed and/or admitted by the surgical team within a district general hospital. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted in the 2-week period from start of the lockdown (Monday 23rd March 2020 to 5th April 2020), and the same period 1 year earlier (Monday 25th March 2019 to 7th April 2019). Number of patients reviewed and admitted were compared between the two cohorts. Data including diagnosis, operation/procedural interventions, and length of stay were analysed. The overall number of patients reviewed and admitted by the surgical team was substantially lower during the period of lockdown (61 vs 126). Of the patients seen during lockdown, a smaller proportion were admitted to hospital after initial surgical review (59% vs 77%, p&lt;0.05). Interventional/operative procedures were performed in a similar proportion of patients in both cohorts (31%). Our data show that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of patients being referred to and admitted by the general surgical team at our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. Explanations for this include reduced attendance due to risk perception of the patients, the impact of lockdown messages and advice regarding self-isolation, as well as an increased threshold for patient admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key learning points include the possible benefits of a reduction in admission to hospital of patients with nonurgent conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A novel steel box bridge pier with replaceable energy dissipation wall plates at the base was proposed. After moderate earthquakes, the damaged energy dissipation wall plates and constraining steel plates on the two sides could be rapidly replaced, while the entire energy-dissipated column at the base can also be replaced after rare earthquakes. In this way, the seismic capacity of the new type of steel box bridge pier could be restored after earthquakes. For the purpose of discussing the seismic performance of this novel steel box-shaped bridge pier, the pseudostatic test and numerical simulation were performed. The results showed that the failure of the specimens in the pseudostatic tests occurred predominantly in the energy dissipation zone at the base. After replacing the damaged energy-dissipated column at the base, the seismic behavior of the proposed steel bridge pier can be recovered rapidly. Axial compression ratio is an important factor influencing the seismic behavior of the novel steel box bridge pier. The strength of the energy dissipation wall plates influences the novel steel box-shaped bridge pier’s bearing capacity and deformation capacity. Spacing between the horizontal stiffening ribs had little impact on the bearing capacity and deformation capacity of the proposed steel bridge pier. The larger the thickness of the energy dissipation wall plate, the higher the bearing capacity and deformation capacity of the steel box bridge pier. Finally, an empirical equation for the design of this novel steel bridge pier under cyclic loading was proposed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Treating skeletal class III malocclusions is one of the biggest challenges in Orthodontics. Given the complexity of these cases, orthognathic surgery is often the best treatment option. However, many patients refuse this treatment due to its risks, morbidity, and costs involved. Alternatively, dental compensation can be planned for some of these skeletal problems. This case report presents a dentoalveolar compensation in the orthodontic treatment of a 20-year-old female patient with class III malocclusion, concave profile, anterior crossbite, mandibular prognathism, maxillary retrusion, and a vertical deficiency in the posterior region. Treatment planning involved a multiloop edgewise archwire (MEAW) associated with intermaxillary elastics with counterclockwise rotation of the occlusal plane in the posterior region of the maxilla aiming at obtaining an increased posterior vertical dimension. After 24 months of treatment, the severe anterior crossbite was corrected, and the skeletal class III relationship was camouflaged. At the end of the orthodontic treatment, it was possible to observe an improved facial profile, a nice smile, and a functional occlusion. The results remained stable at a three-year follow-up. The MEAW, associated with the use of elastics, seems to be an effective treatment option for class III camouflage with reduced posterior vertical dimension with no need for additional anchoring devices but requiring adequate bending of wires and patient compliance.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Yong Guo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a cantilevered microtube conveying fluid, undergoing large motions and subjected to motion-limiting constraints. Based on the modified couple stress theory and the von Kármán relationship, the strain energy of the microtube can be deduced and then the governing equation of motion is derived by using the Hamilton principle. The Galerkin method is applied to produce a set of ordinary differential equations. The effect of the internal material length scale parameter on the critical flow velocity is investigated. By using the projection method, the Hopf bifurcation is demonstrated. The results show that size effect on the vibration properties is significant.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Objectives. Back pains associated with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) may arise not just from vertebral body but also from posterior elements. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and facet blocking (FB) combined therapy would relieve pain better, but it has not been elucidated. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the treatment effects of PVP and FB combined therapy with PVP alone in OVCFs patients. Methods. Clinical and radiological data of 204 patients were reviewed. The patients were divided into Group A (PVP alone) and Group B (PVP and FB combined therapy) according to treatments. Back pain was evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The operation, fluoroscopic exposure time, and bone cement leakage were recorded. The χ2 test, Student’s t-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to compare the differences between the two groups. Results. There were 125 patients in Group A and 79 patients in Group B. Their baseline characteristics were similar (P&gt;0.05). The mean VAS scores of Group A and Group B were 7.03 and 7.21 at admission, 4.7 and 3.2 at 1 day after operation, 4.0 and 3.0 at 3 months, and 2.2 and 2.2 at 12 months after operation, respectively. The mean ODI scores of Group A and Group B were 30.9 and 29.8 at admission, 17.6 and 17.7 at 3 months, and 10.5 and 10.9 at 12 months after operation, respectively. The mean operation time and fluoroscopic exposure time of Group A (35.6 minutes and 7.2 seconds, respectively) was significantly shorter than that of Group B (45.7 minutes and 11.7 seconds, respectively, P&lt;0.01). The incidence of bone cement leakage and new fractures after operation did not have statistically significant difference between groups. Conclusion. PVP and FB combined therapy could provide better pain relief than PVP alone in short term after operation in patients with OVCFs associated back pains.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. The geometry of root canals differs in different parts, especially in the apical region, and it is affected by different preparation techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the geometric changes of root canal preparation by general dentists regardless of the endodontic instrumentation systems and to study the quality of endodontic treatment by evaluating the untouched areas after mechanical preparation and the smear layer removal. Materials and Methods. 100 extracted maxillary canines were collected for the in vitro study from 10 dentists, and the dentists were asked to treat the teeth endodontically. The teeth then were separated and examined under an optical microscope to evaluate the root canal final diameter and the untouched areas. Then, the teeth were examined under a scanned electronic microscope to evaluate the smear layer in coronal, middle, and third parts of the canal. Statistical significance was set as P&lt;0.05. Results. The mean diameter of the root canal after instrumentation in the coronal and middle thirds was 2.50 ± 1.12 and 1.75 ± 1.24 mm, respectively, and the untouched area percentage observed in the apical thirds was 71%. For smear layer removal, it was better in the coronal and middle thirds than in the apical (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion. The changes in the diameter of the root canal, the percentage of untouched areas after mechanical preparation, and the percentage of smear layer were observed in a higher percent in the apical third than in the coronal and middle thirds, and this raises the question of changing the technique of processing the root canal, especially in the apical third.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. A high mortality has been reported during the first ninety days of cancer therapy and is more pronounced in patients with febrile neutropenia. The Bugando Medical Center oncology department offers cancer diagnosis and treatment services to the population of the Lake Zone of Tanzania with limited data on the outcome within 90 days of therapy. Here, we report the 90-day mortality and factors associated with it among cancer patients attending the oncology department of the tertiary hospital in Tanzania. Methodology. Enrolled participants underwent baseline physical examinations, and their functional status was assessed using Karnofsky score. On each clinic visit, full blood picture was taken and patients were investigated for infections. Data were entered in the Microsoft Excel, cleaned and coded and then transferred to STATA version 13 for analysis. Results. A total of 102 participants were included in the final analysis. Their median age was 50 years (38-60). The majority of the study participants were females 76 (75%), and 82 (80.4%) had primary school education. The majority of the patients had solid cancer 96 (94.1%). A total of 12 (11.8%) patients died within 90 days of starting therapy. Low hemoglobin level at the start of cancer therapy, Karnofsky score below 80%, and using 5-fluorouracil-containing therapy were statistically significantly found to be associated with mortality within 90 days of therapy among cancer patients. Conclusion. One tenth of cancer patients at Bugando Medical Center do not survive within 90 days of therapy; the mortality is significantly high among anemic patients, with poor performance status, on 5-fluorouracil regimen, and diagnosed with head and neck cancer, necessitating close follow-up of these patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. High fertility and aspiration to have more children are a normal phenomenon in many developing countries including Ethiopia. The desire of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to have children can have significant public health implications. Despite the growing number of women living with HIV/AIDS, the issues of fertility and childbearing intention have not been widely studied in Ethiopia. Objective. To identify determinants of fertility desire among women living with HIV in the childbearing age attending antiretroviral therapy clinic at Jimma University Medical Center, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods. A facility-based case-control study was conducted in March 2019. Cases were women living with HIV who had fertility desire, and controls were those who had not. Data was collected using a face-to-face interview using a pretested questionnaire. The data was entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS Version 24 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify candidate and independent determinants of fertility desire, respectively. Independent determinants associated with fertility desire were assessed using AORs with their corresponding 95% CIs at P value &lt; 0.05 cutoff point. Results. Three hundred forty-four (115 cases and 229 controls) were included into the study with a 100% response rate. Age categories 15-24 (AOR: 4.1; 95% CI: 2.0, 8.4) and 25-34 (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.2) years, not using family planning (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4, 4.0), and having a sexual partner (AOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.2) were independent predictors of fertility desire. Conclusions. Age of women, family planning, and sexual partner were found to be the independent predictors of fertility desire among women living with HIV/AIDS. Policymakers and health care providers who are working on an ART clinic should try to consider the effects of these factors for women living with HIV while developing HIV/AIDS interventions and discussing on sexual and reproductive health issues with their clients, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. It is widely accepted that inflammation may contribute to cognitive impairment in patients with vascular dementia (VD). Our prior clinical researches have reported that acupuncture can alleviate cognitive function in VD, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The purpose of this research was to explore whether acupuncture alleviates cognitive impairment by suppressing the microRNA-93- (miR-93-) mediated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, which triggers inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Methods. VD was established by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in male Wistar rats. Three days after operation, the rats began daily treatment with acupuncture for two weeks. The levels of miR-93, Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4), intracellular signaling molecules (myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)), and inflammatory cytokines were subsequently detected. TLR4 colocalized with neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the hippocampus was evaluated. Neuroinflammation and cognitive function were determined after intracerebroventricular injection of TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 or agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without acupuncture. Results. We found that acupuncture notably repressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma of VD rats. The expression of TLR4, but not TLR2, was markedly downregulated by acupuncture, accompanied by a decrease in miR-93 and MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. The overexpression of TLR4 in microglia, but not in astrocytes and neurons, was reversed by acupuncture. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of TAK-242 had similar effects to acupuncture on inflammation and cognitive function, while LPS injection abolished the beneficial effects of acupuncture. Conclusions. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that acupuncture attenuates cognitive impairment associated with inflammation through inhibition of the miR-93-mediated TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in experimental VD. Acupuncture serves as a promising alternative therapy and may be an underlying TLR4 inhibitor for the treatment of VD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lacrimal gland neoplasms comprise up to 18% of all orbital masses clinically and histologically. Much of our current core knowledge regarding lacrimal gland tumors stems from prior study of their more common counterparts, the salivary glands. The prognosis for each lacrimal gland tumor is contingent upon proper clinical evaluation and ultimately the histopathologic diagnosis. We describe a case of an invasive carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (Ca-ex-PA) with a cystadenocarcinoma component arising from the lacrimal gland in the absence of any previously diagnosed pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor) or prior incisional surgery. This case illustrates the importance of the histopathologic assessment including immunohistochemistry and genetic testing to narrow a differential diagnosis and potentially aid or guide therapy in the future. Our finding suggests that carcinoma of the lacrimal gland may be derived from previously undiagnosed and perhaps even subclinical pleomorphic adenoma.</dc:description>

This paper comprehensively considers the influencing factors such as the mechanical properties of the injected rock mass and the time-varying characteristics of the serous viscosity and introduces the control equation of the fracture channel width to establish a single-fracture nonslab fracturing grouting model. Combining the motion law of the slurry with the extension form of fracture, the equation of slurry diffusion motion, considering the fracture geometry and the time-varying characteristics of the serous viscosity, is derived. Comparing this equation with the existing theories and experiments, the validity and reliability of the theory are verified. In this paper, the effects of rock elastic modulus, slurry viscosity, and grouting rate on the fracturing grouting diffusion law of rock mass are analyzed. It is pointed out that when fracturing grouting in deep rock layers, a larger initial grouting rate and grouting pressure should be selected in the early stages of grouting to generate or penetrate fractures in the rock layer. Also, when the grouting pressure is stable, it is appropriate to increase the viscosity so that the slurry can quickly gel in the fractures thus sealing the fractures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coronavirus Disease (COVID19) is a fast-spreading infectious disease that is currently causing a healthcare crisis around the world. Due to the current limitations of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based tests for detecting COVID19, recently radiology imaging based ideas have been proposed by various works. In this work, various Deep CNN based approaches are explored for detecting the presence of COVID19 from chest CT images. A decision fusion based approach is also proposed, which combines predictions from multiple individual models, to produce a final prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed decision fusion based approach is able to achieve above 86% results across all the performance metrics under consideration, with average AUROC and F1-Score being 0.883 and 0.867, respectively. The experimental observations suggest the potential applicability of such Deep CNN based approach in real diagnostic scenarios, which could be of very high utility in terms of achieving fast testing for COVID19.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To balance sustainable road construction and environmental impact, intrinsic relationships between regional road networks and land surface temperature (LST) along the roads must be examined. In this study, we hypothesize that expanding road networks can affect the LST within a given region. Thus, we determined the influence of varying road grades on the surrounding LST. Using an improved single-window algorithm with reasonably adjusted water vapor parameters, LST data for the relevant areas were extracted from Landsat 8 data. Analyzing these data revealed that, in the improved single-window algorithm, the MOD05 L2 water vapor parameter could obtain results, indicating that road grades are positively correlated with LST changes when road network mileage is increased. In addition, we found that LST was increased by highways and low-grade roads over distances of 180 m and 150 m compared with the surrounding area, respectively. Furthermore, LST was affected by road interchanges over a distance of 300 m and by intersections formed by low-grade roads over 150 m; both have a linear nonuniform influence on the propagation models. Finally, we determined that different highways in the LST radiation range can interact to form an LST concentration zone, resulting in further LST increases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two novel compounds, 2-(2-hydroxyethylthio)-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HEDMNQ) and 2-(6-hydroxyhexylthio)-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HHDMNQ), were synthesized to investigate the kill effects and mechanism of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives in lung cancer cells. The results of the CCK-8 assay showed that HEDMNQ and HHDMNQ had significant cytotoxic effects on A549, NCI-H23, and NCI-H460 NSCLC cells. Flow cytometry and western blot results indicated that HHDMNQ induced A549 cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by decreasing the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 and cyclin B1. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry results indicated that HHDMNQ could induce A549 cell apoptosis, and western blot analysis showed that HHDMNQ induced apoptosis through regulating the mitochondria pathway, as well as the MAPK, STAT3, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Flow cytometry results showed that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were increased after HHDMNQ treatment, and western blot showed that ROS could modulate the intrinsic pathway and MAPK, STAT3, and NF-κB signalling pathways. These effects were blocked by the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine in A549 cells. Our findings suggest that compared with HEDMNQ, HHDMNQ had the stronger ability to inhibit the cell viability of lung cancer cells and induce apoptosis by regulating the ROS-mediated intrinsic pathway and MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB signalling pathways. Thus, HHDMNQ might be a potential antitumour compound for treating lung cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background/Aims. In previous studies, it has been observed that Xiaotan Jieyu (XTJY) prescription may inhibit the proliferation of human breast precancerous lesion MCF-10AT cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The purpose of this study is to further verify the therapeutic effect and the possible mechanism of XTJY on precancerous lesions of breast cancer in vivo. Methods. The successfully established breast precancerous lesion rat model and normal healthy rats were randomly assigned into the blank (BLA), model (MOD), XTJY-low (LD), XTJY-medium (MD), XTJY-high (HD), and tamoxifen (TAM) groups. Different concentrations of XTJY and saline were supplied by intragastric administration for 4 consecutive weeks to assess the protective effect of XTJY on the progress of the breast precancerous lesion in rats involving the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Results. In this study, it determined that 10 mg/each rat DMBA-combined estrogen and progesterone induction for 10 weeks was the optimal condition for the establishment of the breast precancerous lesion rat model. In vivo administration of XTJY or TAM was found to inhibit the development of the breast precancerous lesion, and the occurrence rate of breast invasive carcinomas was decreased by about 50%. Furthermore, XTJY or TAM markedly reduced protein expressions of PI3K and p-Akt and increased protein expressions of PTEN. Conclusion. These data indicated that XTJY can significantly alleviate the development of breast precancerous lesions by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. XTJY may be a promising drug for the treatment of precancerous lesions in breast cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In view of the large deformation of thin-layer soft rock in the No. 2 inclined shaft of the Muzhailing Tunnel, we performed an experimental investigation on the mineral composition, physical characteristics, and uniaxial compressive strength of the surrounding rock of the tunnel. The characteristics of the large deformation of the surrounding rock of the tunnel were analyzed, and the main factors influencing the deformation of the tunnel were revealed. The influence of various factors on the large deformation of the surrounding rock was analyzed using the 3DEC-Trigon discrete element numerical simulation method. The results show that (1) the deformation of the surrounding rock of the tunnel has remarkable asymmetry, the deformation of the initial support of the tunnel is significant, and the buried depth of the area where the maximum deformation of the tunnel exceeded 1 m is greater than 500 m; (2) the main factors influencing the deformation of a thin-layer slate tunnel include joint inclination, buried depth, water absorption, and softening of the surrounding rock; and (3) the maximum deformation of the surrounding rock is observed for a joint angle of 45°, at which the buried depth is directly proportional to the deformation and failure of the tunnel. Furthermore, after the surrounding rock was softened by water absorption, the floor of the tunnel, the left shoulder socket, and the right side of the tunnel are deformed greatly. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for the study of similar deformation control methods and supporting measures for tunnels excavated in thin-layer soft rock.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The stress concentration of gob-side entry surrounding rock is a hot topic in coal mining. In this paper, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the pressure relief mechanism of the gob-side entry retaining by roof cutting and pressure release (RCPR) and the spatiotemporal development law of surrounding rock stress of the gob-side entry were analyzed. The studies showed that the gob-side entry retaining by RCPR shortened the length of the lateral cantilever by directional roof cutting, which weakened the stress level of the gob-side entry. In the meantime, the goaf gangues could play a good filling role by using their breaking and swelling characteristics under the action of gangue-blocking supports and further optimized the stress environment along the roadway. Field industrial tests verified that the gob-side entry retaining by RCPR had a significant effect on pressure relief, and the surrounding rock stress and deformation tended to stabilize after about 160 m of lagging working face. Numerical analysis reproduced the whole process of “mining-retention-using” of roof cutting roadway and revealed that surrounding rocks were always in the zone of relative stress reduction during the whole process. The peak value of mining-induced lateral stress was about 10 m away from the middle point of the gob-side entry. The change of surrounding rock stress could be divided into three stages: significant increase, dynamic adjustment, and stable stage. However, during the second mining, the stress connected zone would appear on the leading working face, and the stress concentration in this zone was significant. Based on the above analysis, we concluded that the new technology could be applied to the medium-thickness coal seam in the composite roof.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Neutrophils have a traditional role in inflammatory process and act as the first line of defense against infections. Although their contribution to tumorigenesis and progression is still controversial, accumulating evidence recently has demonstrated that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a key role in multiple aspects of cancer biology. Here, we detected that chemokine CXCL1 was dramatically elevated in serum from 3LL tumor-bearing mice. In vitro, 3LL cells constitutively expressed and secreted higher level of CXCL1. Furthermore, knocking down CXCL1 expression in 3LL cells significantly hindered tumor growth by inhibiting recruitment of neutrophils from peripheral blood into tumor tissues. Additionally, tumor-infiltrated neutrophils expressed higher levels of MPO and Fas/FasL, which may be involved in TAN-mediated inhibition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that tumor-derived CXCL1 contributes to TANs infiltration in lung cancer which promotes tumor growth.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Sung-Yong Kim</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jaemin Kim</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Bouc–Wen hysteresis model has been extensively used to identify earthquake damage on civil structures where hysteretic behavior is expected. One of the challenging problems in the identification of Bouc–Wen parameters is overfitting, which is caused by too many nonphysical model parameters. Limit on the search domain of parameters helps to solve the problem. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is widely developed to find Bouc–Wen parameters. In order to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of conventional UKF, this study developed a constrained UKF (CUKF) which can be used for the simultaneous identification of the Bouc–Wen hysteretic model. The proposed CUKF is very helpful when certain parameters can be constrained in a physical sense. We compare the proposed CUKF with conventional UKF to validate its robustness and efficacy in identifying Bouc–Wen parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Delayed diagnosis of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite progress in systemic therapy and radiotherapy, there has only been a slight improvement in the five-year survival rate. A non-invasive diagnostic method that consists of an assessment of specific proteins in saliva samples may significantly facilitate assessment of treatment results in patients diagnosed with oral and oropharyngeal cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of IL-17 and TNF-α in the saliva of patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer. The study was conducted prior to treatment in patients hospitalized in the Frederic Chopin Provincial Specialist Hospital No. 1 in Rzeszów, Poland. Saliva samples were collected from subjects on an empty stomach. Cytokine concentrations in the saliva were measured with ELISA and Luminex Multiplex Assays. The higher salivary concentrations of IL-17A, IL-17F, and TNF-α were significantly associated with disease advancement. Lower levels of IL-17A were associated with colonization of the oral cavity with aerobic bacteria. On the other hand, higher concentration of TNF-α was observed in patients with positive aerobic culture of oral swabs.

<dc:description>Introduction. The latest national healthcare reform policies of Sri Lanka include the development of accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments in all major hospitals. Provincial General Hospital Kurunegala (PGHK) is a home to the first established A&amp;E department in Sri Lanka. PGHK provides services to a population of 2.4 million spread out in the North Western Province and part of the Sabaragamuwa Province. This study was carried out to identify the pattern of all admissions to the A&amp;E department of PGHK. Methods. The prospective observational study was carried out from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017 (one year) to identify the pattern of admissions to the A&amp;E department. Results. There were 49,213 admissions to PGHK’s A&amp;E department during the study period. The average number of admissions was 135 (±17.9) per day. The percentage of deaths in the A&amp;E department was 0.21%. The mean age of admitted patients was 46.7 (±21.7) years. A further 62% of admitted patients were males. The number of medical, surgical, paediatric, and gynaecological and obstetrical admissions was 55%, 42%, 3.5%, and 0.22%, respectively. Among the common emergency medical presentations, 34% were chest pain, 11% patients presented with unilateral weakness and/or slurring of speech, 10% covered dyspnoea, and 9% complained of dizziness/giddiness. Among emergency surgical presentations, 83% were trauma due to accidents, of which 27% were road-traffic-related accidents (RTAs). Discussion. The A&amp;E department of PGHK provides services to a significantly high number of health emergencies every day. The majority of these admissions was due to chest pain and trauma related to accidents. The lower recorded number of paediatric and gynaecological and obstetrical emergencies presented to the A&amp;E department is a result of a government policy mandating the admission of these types of patients directly to their respective wards. Further infrastructure development, staff recruitment, and training have to be planned and implemented to address the significantly high number of admissions to the A&amp;E Department of PGHK.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The infiltration and physical and chemical effects of fissure water often have a degrading effect on the strength and bearing capacity of the surrounding rock of the roadway. With the increase of the time of water infiltration, the roadway deformation increases exponentially, resulting in a higher risk of roadway destruction. In this paper, targeting at the supporting and protection issues associated with the main inclined shaft during the water-drenching, a numerical simulation method was established to evaluate the impact of the fissure water on the deformation of the surrounding rock of the roadway, and a solution to control the top water in main inclined shafts by grouting was proposed. Through the numerical simulation method, the effective penetration range of the slurry in the surrounding rock and the variation of the tunnel deformation with the grouting timing were studied. A method of combining numerical simulation with on-site monitoring to determine a reasonable grouting timing was proposed. The field application suggests that grouting at a reasonable timing can effectively control the influence of seepage water from the roof crack of the main inclined shaft on the deformation of the roadway surrounding rock, improve the integrity of the roadway surrounding rock, increase the bearing capacity of the support, and maintain the safety and stability of the roadway surrounding rock of the main inclined shaft. Furthermore, this study can provide insightful references to the grouting reinforcement adopted by similar main inclined shafts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. To illustrate the impact of the implementation of a multidisciplinary TTL program in 2005 on the mortality of trauma patients in a level 1 trauma center as well as admission rates and length of stay. Methods. Retrospective observational study of all trauma patients included in the provincial trauma database at the Montreal General Hospital between 1998 and 2015. The primary outcome studied was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes studied were hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) rates of admission and hospital and ICU length of stay. Results. 24,107 patients were included. We observed a statistically significant reduction in mortality of 1.25% or a relative reduction of 16% (p value = 0.0058; rate ratio 0.844 (95% CI 0.747–0.952)). ICU admissions were also significantly reduced where we observed a statistically significant absolute reduction of 4.46% or a relative reduction of 14% (p value = 8.38 × 10−7; rate ratio 0.859 (95% CI 0.808–0.912)). The ICU length of stay was increased by 0.91 days or 19.03% (p value = 0.016 (95% CI 0.167–1.655)). There was no observed change in overall length of stay (13.97 days pre-TTL and 12.91 post-TTL (p value = 0.13; estimate −1.053 (95% CI −2.424–0.318))). Conclusions. This article suggests that multidisciplinary TTL model may be beneficial in the care of trauma patients. Further subgroup analysis may help determine which patients could benefit more.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pristine montmorillonite (Mont) was used as raw materials to prepare hydroxyl-Fe-pillared Mont, hydroxyl-Al-pillared Mont, and hydroxyl-Fe-Al-pillared Mont composites. By varying the OH/Fe and Fe/Al molar ratios during the preparation of the pillared Mont, the adsorption capacity of zearalenone (ZEA) and the kinetics were elucidated. The characterization of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy reveals the adsorption mechanism of pristine and modified Mont. The results indicated that the ZEA adsorption capacity is Mont (0.05 mg/g) &lt;&lt; 1.5OH/Fe-Mont (0.28 mg/g) &lt;&lt; OH/Al-Mont (0.51 mg/g) &lt; 0.5Fe/Al-Mont (0.56 mg/g) in the condition of pH = 8 and 37°C, in which both 0.5Fe/Al-Mont and OH/Al-Mont reached maximum adsorption capacity and 1.5OH/Fe-Mont attained 5 times the capacity of Mont. Adsorption isotherm studies revealed that Freundlich adsorption isotherms best represented the experimental data. The kinetic data for ZEA adsorption revealed that the Mont adsorption capacity for ZEA equilibrates in 1 hour and is best described using the pseudo-second-order rate equation. The XRD analysis indicated that the amplification of Fe-dominant pillared Mont interlayer spacing is the main reason for the observed increases in the adsorption capacity of ZEA, while Al-dominant pillared Mont has a relatively stable Keggin structure; therefore, interlayer spacing is not the primary mechanism for changes in the adsorption capacity of both OH/Al-Mont and Al-dominant pillared Mont. An FT-IR analysis demonstrated that cationic exchange was the dominant mechanism that allowed ZEA and hydroxyl-Al ions to enter the Mont interlayers, while this cationic exchange mechanism was not the dominant mechanism used by hydroxyl-Fe entering the Mont layers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The use of cell secreted factors in clinical settings could be an alternative to conventional cell therapy, with the advantage of limiting concerns generally associated with traditional cell transplantation, such as tumorigenicity, immunoreactivity, and carrying of infections. Based on our published data, we predict a potential role for extracellular vesicles (EVs) in contributing to the proangiogenic activity of human fetal dermal cell secretome. Depletion of nanosized EVs from secretome significantly impaired its ability to induce formation of mesh-like structures in vitro. The isolated EVs were characterized for size and concentration by nanoparticle tracking analysis, and for protein markers (Rab5+, Alix+, CD63+, and calnexin-). The microRNA profile of EVs revealed 87 microRNAs significantly upregulated (≥15-fold increase) in fetal compared to adult dermal cell-derived EVs. Interestingly, these upregulated microRNAs included microRNAs with a validated role in angiogenesis according to literature. Moreover, the DIANA-TarBase v7.0 analysis confirmed enrichment in the KEGG signaling pathways associated with angiogenesis and wound healing, with the identification of putative target genes including thrombospondin 1. To validate the in silico data, EVs were also characterized for total protein contents. When tested in in vitro angiogenesis, fetal dermal cell-derived EVs were more effective than their adult counterpart in inducing formation of complete mesh-like structures. Furthermore, treatment of fibroblasts with fetal dermal-derived EVs determined a 4-fold increase of thrombospondin 1 protein amounts compared with the untreated fibroblasts. Finally, visualization of CSFE-labeled EVs in the cytosol of target cells suggested a successful uptake of these particles at 4-8 hours of incubation. We conclude that EVs are important contributors of the proangiogenic effect of fetal dermal cell secretome. Hence, EVs could also serve as vehicle for a successful delivery of microRNAs or other molecules of therapeutic interest to target cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Orobanche crenata is a parasitic weed that causes considerable yield losses on food legumes in Ethiopia and the Mediterranean region. Understanding the genetic diversity of Orobanche crenata using molecular techniques generate useful information in managing the weed through resistance breeding. This study aimed at assessing the genetic diversity of O. crenata populations collected from major faba bean growing areas of Ethiopia. A total of 96 samples were collected from the Orobanche-infested faba bean farmer field. The genetic diversity of the population was studied using 30 O. cumana SSR markers. The results showed that 11 SSRs were functional and transferable markers to study the diversity of O. crenata populations. The average number of alleles, gene diversity, heterozygosity, and polymorphic information content values for the SSR loci were 9.6, 0.82, 0.38, and 0.80, respectively. The pairwise genetic similarity analysis showed the lowest genetic distance between samples collected from South Gondar and South Wollo (0.12) while the highest genetic distance (0.48) was found between South Gondar and North Wollo. The analysis of molecular variance result indicated that the variation among individuals was a major source of genetic variation (55%) followed by within individuals (43%) and among populations (2%) variation. The output of population genetic structure analysis indicated the presence of two major groups irrespective of the area of collection or region of origin. Besides, the outcome of the spatial autocorrelation computation indicated a significant and positive genetic correlation between samples collected under a 28 km radius. In general, the absence of geographic region based genetic structure presumably demonstrates the expansion of the parasitic weed between farming sites upon its recent introduction to the country. Thus, the clear absence of population differentiation warrants screening faba bean population in hot spot area.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigates the possibility of applying an adsorption process using two abundant natural minerals M1 and M2. Without pretreatment or activation, the adsorbents were used to treat real textile wastewater samples (collected from Fez city, Morocco). As a cost-effective alternative, these materials were characterized by different analyses, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were used to characterize the textile wastewater. Additionally, the influence of operating conditions (contact time, adsorbent dosages, and pH) was evaluated. Results show that the adsorption process takes place quickly, reaching the equilibrium at 90 and 160 min for M1 (88% COD) and M2 (79% COD). Both materials show a higher affinity to Cr (39%) and lower affinity to Cu (28%). A pseudo-second-order kinetic model provides the best fit to the experimental adsorption data. Germination tests indicate a low toxicity after the adsorption process. Performance of both materials was compared with that of other literature studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of ultrathin BiOCl 2D nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by the TBAOH-assisted hydrolysis method in water. The effects of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) dosages, chlorine source, preparation pH value, ultrasonic treatment, and magnetic stirring on the photocatalytic degradation dynamics of carbamazepine were examined under visible-light irradiation to optimize the preparation parameters. It was found that ultrathin BiOCl prepared with TBAOH dosages of 1 mmol and chlorine source of NaCl in the pH of 2 upon magnetic stirring of 6 h displayed the highest photocatalytic degradation rate constant (0.0038 min−1) of carbamazepine, which is 7.6 times higher than that with the ordinary BiOCl (without TBAOH). To clarify the mechanism on the outstanding photocatalytic activity of ultrathin BiOCl, the elemental composition/state, micromorphology, and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL). Results showed that the presence of oxygen vacancy, ultrathin nanosheet structure, and improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs contributed to the excellent photocatalytic degradation activity of ultrathin BiOCl. The obtained result provides a novel method to fabricate ultrathin BiOCl with excellent photocatalytic degradation activity of carbamazepine under visible-light irradiation.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ayed Al e’damat</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this work, a modified residual power series method is implemented for providing efficient analytical and approximate solutions for a class of coupled system of nonlinear fractional integrodifferential equations. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of residual error functions and generalized power series formula. The fractional derivative is described under the Caputo concept. To illustrate the potential, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method, two numerical applications of the coupled system of nonlinear fractional integrodifferential equations are tested. The numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and depict that the suggested scheme is highly convenient, is quite effective, and practically simplifies computational time. Consequently, the proposed method is simple, accurate, and convenient in handling different types of fractional models arising in the engineering and physical systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In practice, inappropriate test set-up and design will result in pile eccentricity, reducing pile bearing capacity. Also, inappropriate piling will reduce the strength of the upper part of concrete. These pile elements under inappropriate design and construction are easy to be overlooked since they are invisible. Because the research focuses on the pile failure behaviour under different conditions, this paper aims to determine the outcomes of pile foundation under eccentric loading, pile with inadequate concrete strength, and pile with punching failure. Four concrete piles were cast, and compressive static load tests (SLTs) were performed. The top part of the first pile was cast with inadequate concrete strength. The other two piles were cast with achieved concrete strength; however, one of these applied with eccentric loading. The third pile was the standard pile, and the fourth pile was tested until punching failure occurred. For the fourth pile, the T-Z method was used for determining the failure characteristics. It is discovered that, for the pile with inadequate concrete strength, the cracks occurred at the pile head, and the concrete crushed at 0.9–1.2 m below the ground; for the pile suffering eccentricity, the partial concrete crushed, and the concrete from the opposite side suffered tension fracture; for the pile suffering punching failure, the crack on the soil extends up to 50 mm. Traditional result presentations and interpretations were also provided. Furthermore, it was found that, for the pile suffering punching failure, the shaft resistance increased as the loads increased, and after the loading achieved the maximum resistance, the loading transferred to the pile tip and finally led to the destruction of the pile-soil system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that regulate gene expression. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants that exist as complex mixtures in vivo. When humans are simultaneously exposed to these compounds, the development of atherosclerosis is known to be enhanced. However, the roles of miRNA in TCDD- and PCB-induced atherosclerosis are largely unknown. Therefore, the present study is aimed at elucidating the possible dysregulation of miRNAs in atherogenesis induced by coexposure to TCDD and PCBs. Eight-week-old male ApoE-/- mice were coexposed to TCDD (15 μg/kg) and Aroclor1254 (55 mg/kg, a representative mixture of PCBs) by intraperitoneal injection four times over a 6-week period. Microarray analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs in the liver of ApoE-/- mice with or without TCDD and Aroclor1254 coexposure was performed. We discovered that 68 miRNAs and 1312 mRNAs exhibited significant expression changes in response to TCDD and PCB coexposure and revealed that both changed miRNAs and mRNAs are involved in cardiovascular disease processes. An integrated miRNA-mRNA approach indicated that miRNA-26a-5p, miRNA-193a-3p, and miRNA-30c-5p participated in specific TCDD and Aroclor1254 coresponsive networks which are relevant to the cardiovascular system development and function network. Furthermore, our results also indicated that miRNA-130a-3p and miRNA-376a-3p were novel players in the regulation of TCDD- and Aroclor1254-induced atherosclerosis pathways. In summary, our finding provided new insights into the mechanism of atherosclerosis in response to TCDD and PCB coexposure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. We aimed at investigating the effects of uniaxial static strain on osteoblasts in distraction osteogenesis (DO). Methods. To simulate the mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts during DO, 10% uniaxial static strain was applied to osteoblasts using a homemade multiunit cell stretching and compressing device. Before and after applying strain stimulation, the morphological changes of osteoblasts were observed by inverted phase-contrast microscopy, Coomassie blue staining, and immunofluorescence. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mRNA levels (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], ALP, Runx2, osteocalcin [OCN], collagen type I, hypoxia-inducible factor- [HIF-] 1α, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), and protein levels (Runx2, OCN, collagen type I, HIF-1α, and VEGF) were evaluated by using ALP kit, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. After the mechanical stimulation, the cytoskeleton microfilaments were rearranged, and the cell growth direction of the osteoblasts became ordered, with their direction being at an angle of about 45° from the direction of strain. The proliferation of osteoblasts and the expression levels of mRNA and protein of ALP, Runx2, OCN, collagen type I, HIF-1α, and VEGF were significantly higher than in the nonstretch control groups. Conclusion. Our homemade device can exert uniaxial static strain and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts and bone matrix formation. It can be used to simulate the mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts during DO.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Clostridium perfringens type C (C. perfringens type C) is one of the main microbial pathogens responsible for piglet diarrhea worldwide, causing substantial economic losses for pig-rearing industries. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a key regulator of inflammatory bowel disease, especially necrotic enteritis. However, whether and how the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in regulating the process of piglet diarrhea when challenged by C. perfringens type C are still unknown. Here, we screened 38 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in piglets’ ileum tissues experimentally infected with C. perfringens type C that were enriched in the Sus scrofa MAPK signaling pathway, based on our previous transcriptome data. Of these DEGs, 12 genes (TRAF2, MAPK8, and GADD45G, among others) were upregulated whereas 26 genes (MAPK1, TP53, and CHUK, among others) were downregulated in the infected group. Our results showed that MAPK1, TP53, MAPK8, MYC, and CHUK were in the core nodes of the PPI network. Additionally, we obtained 35 lncRNAs from the sequencing data, which could be trans-targeted to MAPK signaling pathway genes and were differentially expressed in the ileum tissues infected with C. perfringens. We used qRT-PCR to verify the expression levels of genes and lncRNAs related to the MAPK signaling pathway; their expression patterns were consistent with RNA sequencing data. Our results provide strong support for deeply exploring the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in diarrhea caused by C. perfringens type C.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous model to describe the propagation dynamics of malware (viruses, worms, Trojan horses, etc.) in wireless sensor networks. Our model takes into consideration different battery-level sensor nodes contrary to existing models. In order to control the spread of malware, we design an aperiodically intermittent controller driven by white noise, which has striking advantages of lower cost and more flexible control strategy. We give a distinct condition on stability in probability one using graph-theoretical Lyapunov function and stochastic analysis method. Our results show that the nonlinear malware propagation system can be stabilized by intermittent stochastic perturbation under the intermittent time related to stochastic perturbation intensity. Our theoretical results can be applied to understand the observed mechanisms of malware and design interventions to control the spread of malware. Numerical simulations illustrate our analytical results clearly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term impact of new calcium silicate-based sealer (HiFlow Bioceramic) compared to calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex) on mineral constituents and crystallinity of radicular dentin. Methods. Roots of multirooted maxillary molars were denuded their dentin from all covered cementum then longitudinally split. The dentin segments were divided into three groups covered with either HiFlow root canal sealer or Sealapex root canal sealer or kept untreated (control group). After complete setting of sealers, the radicular dentin of each group was stored in phosphate buffer solution or deionized water for 60 days and then examined with Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope/energy dispersed X-ray and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results. When the dentin was stored in phosphate buffer solution, compared with untreated dentin, Fourier transform infrared spectra showed insignificant increase in the amide I and phosphate, significant increase in carbonate area, and carbonate/phosphate ratio, while there was insignificant change in phosphate/amide I ratio of HiFlow-treated dentin, whereas Sealapex induced significant decrease in amide I area, phosphate area, and phosphate/amide ratio. Both sealers induced significant increase in crystallinity index and significant decrease in crystallinity percent. Energy dispersed X-ray showed decrease in calcium content by both sealers. The phosphate content was increased by HiFlow and decreased by Sealapex. Conclusions. The mineral composition and crystallinity of dentin were insignificantly changed by the long-term HiFlow treatment, whereas, markedly changes by Sealapex.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The compressive sensing (CS) theory provides a new slight to the big-data problem led by the Shannon sampling theorem in rolling element bearings condition monitoring, where the measurement matrix of CS tends to be designed by the random matrix (RM) to preserve the integrity of signal roughly. However, when the signal to be analyzed is infected with strong noise, not only does the signal become insufficiently sparse, but the randomness of the measurement matrix will bring down the sensing efficiency, resulting in the loss of fault feature. Thus, a sensing-enhanced CS scheme based on a series of modes after VMD decomposition is proposed under this paper. The core of this scheme is as follows: (1) the principal mode of VMD with better sparsity replaces the raw signal for compressive sensing; (2) all these modes contain the time-frequency characteristics of the raw signal; (3) a new measurement matrix called mode-circulant matrix (MCM) is defined by circulating the mode matrix, and when the amount of samples is shrunk, the sensing efficiency can be enhanced greatly. Besides, considering the fault signal of rolling bearings under variable speed, there is a need to use order tracking to overcome the nonstationarity of the signal before applying CS theory. The analysis results of simulation and experiment prove that the VMD- and MCM-based CS can successfully extract the weak fault feature of rolling bearings with operating speed changing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Slope stability analysis is a core issue in geotechnical engineering. This paper proposes a method of upper bound limit stability analysis for a slope with multiparameter coordinated variation based on the comprehensive consideration of the nonuniform distribution of slope soil parameters. This method starts from the perspective of energy balance, establishes a slope failure mechanism which meets velocity separation requirements, deduces its calculation formula for external force power and internal energy dissipation power, develops a cycle program for the most dangerous slip surface searching and stability coefficient calculation through computer programming technology, and finally forms a calculation method of upper bound limit stability analysis for the soil slope with nonuniform multiparameter distribution. At the same time, this method takes a dump slope in an open-pit mine as the engineering background, considers the nonuniformity of density, cohesion, and internal friction angle of the slope soil under subsidence, applies upper bound limit analysis to analyze the slope stability, and evaluates the accuracy of analysis results by using the residual thrust method. The results show that upper bound limit analysis has highly accuracy in stability coefficient calculation; compared with the residual thrust method, the stability coefficient calculation result by upper bound limit analysis is a strict upper bound solution, and the calculation error is easy to be estimated and eliminated. Simultaneously, the most dangerous slip surface obtained by upper bound limit analysis can fully satisfy the velocity separation requirement and has a greater engineering reference value.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Red mud, a waste residue of aluminium industry, was used as modified asphalt material to prepare red mud modified asphalt and red mud modified asphalt under freeze-thaw cycles. The matrix asphalt (MA), red mud modified asphalt (RMMA), and red mud modified asphalt under freeze-thaw cycles (RMMAFC) were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Microscopic experiments were conducted to investigate the modification performance and mechanism. The modification mechanism of red mud modified asphalt was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation in this study. The results show that red mud can form a uniform and stable blending system with base asphalt after adding base asphalt. The structure of asphalt after adding red mud and adding red mud and freezing-thawing cycles does not change. The bee-structure decreases obviously with the addition of red mud by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Density decreases gradually, but bee-structure height increases obviously; bee-structure of red mud modified asphalt is destroyed after freeze-thaw cycles. Through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), after adding red mud, heat absorption decreases. Freeze-thaw cycles greatly reduce heat absorption of red mud modified asphalt. Constructing molecular model of major components of red mud (Fe2O3, Al2O3) and asphaltene, simulation results show that the interfacial energy between asphaltene and red mud’s main components Fe2O3 and Al2O3 at −10°C, 25°C, and 170°C is stronger than that of Fe2O3. The results of calculating the interfacial energy of asphaltene on the chemical composition surface of red mud are negative. It can be seen that there are adsorption effects on the surface of asphaltene and red mud. Therefore, increasing the content of Al2O3 or decreasing the content of Fe2O3 in red mud is beneficial to the adsorption of asphaltene.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Case. Two elderly males presented with traumatic shoulder dislocation and bony Bankart fracture consisting of greater than 25% of the glenoid width. Due to several concomitant factors such as polytrauma, activity level, rotator cuff pathology, optimization of comorbidities, risk of complications, and potential for revision surgery, the patients were treated with reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Conclusion. RSA may be a satisfactory treatment option for isolated, large glenoid fractures associated with anterior glenohumeral instability in the elderly. These patients are susceptible to rapid deconditioning with prolonged immobilization and may not be medically suited to undergo the prolonged recovery period associated with open reduction internal fixation or potentially undergo revision operations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Data transmissions suffer from TCP’s poor performance since the introduction of the first commercial wireless services in the 1990s. Recent years have witnessed a surge of academia and industry activities in the field of TCP performance optimization. For a TCP flow whose last hop is a wireless link, congestions in the last hop dominate its performance. We implement an integral data sampling, network monitoring, and rate control software-defined wireless networking (SDWN) system. By analysing our sampled data, we find that there exist strong relationships between congestion packet loss behaviors and the instant cross-layer network metric measurements (states). We utilize these qualitative relationships to predict future congestions in wireless links and enhance TCP performance by launch necessary rate control locally on the access points (AP) before the congestions. We also implement modeling and rate control modules on this platform. Our platform senses the instant wireless dynamic and takes actions promptly to avoid future congestions. We conduct real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. The experiment results show that our methods outperform the bottleneck bandwidth and RTT (BBR) protocol and a recently proposed protocol Vivace on throughput, delay, and jitter performance at least 16.5%, 25%, and 12.6%, respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and Objectives. With the increase in the growth of genetically modified (GM) crops, concerns as to the adverse effects of GM crops have risen in the community. The present systematic review seeks to assess the GM plants’ potential impacts on the sperm parameters, including sperm head, sperm motility, sperm abnormality, and fertility index. Materials and Methods. A structured literature search was independently performed by three authors on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase in January 2019. A total of 1467 publications were obtained by the search strategy after eliminating the duplicates. Moreover, the review only included articles written in English language. Other pertinent peer-reviewed publications were chosen (“snowballing”) from the reference lists in the selected publications. To assess the GM crop effects on infertility, experimental studies designed with the control group were selected. On the basis of abstract screening and full-text reviewing, 39 relevant publications were selected, seven of which were used in our review. To access the quality of articles, we used the Cochrane checklist. The collected articles were scored independently by three authors, and the publications with the eligibility criteria were included in our review. No article was excluded due to quality assessment. Results and Conclusion. Our findings indicated that GM products had no adverse effects on infertility indices such as the sperm head, sperm motility, sperm abnormality, and fertility indices. Long-term research still seems to be strongly necessary to ensure that the use of GM plants does not cause any harm to consumers, especially in infertility area.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The n%Mn-MoS2/rGO (labeled as n%MMS/rGO, where n% = Mn/(Mn + Mo) in mol) composites were successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method from the Mn-MoS2 (MMS) and rGO precursors, in which the MMS was obtained by a facile one-step calcination of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, (NH2)2CS, and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O as precursors in N2 gas at 650°C. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which indicates the composites containing nanosheets of Mn-MoS2 and rGO components. The photocatalytic activities of the n%MMS/rGO composite photocatalysts were evaluated through the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under the visible light irradiation. The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of the achieved composites was attributed to the synergic effect of Mn doping and rGO matrix. The investigation of photocatalytic mechanism was also conducted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aims. To evaluate the expression of DSG1 and DSG2 and investigate their clinicopathological significance in EHCC. Method. The protein expression of DSG1 and DSG2 was measured by EnVision immunohistochemistry in 15 normal biliary tract tissues, 10 biliary tract adenoma tissues, 30 peritumoral tissues, and 100 EHCC tumour tissues. Result. The expression of the DSG1 and DSG2 proteins was significantly lower in EHCC tumour tissues than in normal biliary tract tissues, biliary tract adenoma, and peritumoral tissues (P&lt;0.05). Adenoma and peritumoral tissues with negative DSG1 and/or DSG2 protein expression exhibited atypical hyperplasia. DSG1 expression was positively correlated with DSG2 expression in EHCC (P&lt;0.01). In patients with good differentiation, no invasion, no lymph metastasis, TNM I + II stage, and radical surgery, the positive expression of DSG1 and DSG2 proteins was higher (P&lt;0.05). In comparison to patients with negative DSG1 and/or DSG2 expression, the average overall survival time of those with positive expression was significantly longer (P=0.000). Cox multivariate analysis revealed that negative DSG1 and DSG2 expressions were independent of poor prognosis factors in EHCC patients. The AUC calculated for DSG1 was 0.681 (95% confidence interval: 0.594–0.768) and that for DSG2 was 0.645 (95% confidence interval: 0.555–0.734), while that for DSG1 and DSG2 was 0.772 (95% confidence interval: 0.609-0.936). Conclusions. Negative protein expression of DSG1 and DSG2 is closely related to the pathogenesis, severe clinicopathological characteristics, aggressive biological behaviours, and dismal prognosis in EHCC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interfirm cooperation can be seen as a significant and effective way for exploring radical innovation. In this article, a framework of interfirm cooperation, with a core manufacture and upstream counterparties in industry, and its evolving mechanism in the reverse-chain radical innovation are established from the perspective of the fundamental role played by knowledge collaboration. Then, an evolution model of interfirm cooperation is constructed on the theory of vibration mechanics, and its evolutionary dynamics is explored through numerical and simulation analysis mainly on the key factors of knowledge potential difference and knowledge rent-seeking behaviour within the firms. The findings show that, if there is no knowledge-based rent-seeking behaviour from the upstream firms, the probable innovative performance from the interfirm cooperation should vary for the knowledge potential difference between the cooperative firms, but can come to a certain equilibrium state. Meanwhile, if the knowledge rent-seeking behaviour does exist, knowledge potential difference would lead the innovative performance evolving ultimately in divergence. What’s more, the negative effect caused by the rent-seeking behaviour could be alleviated or weakened to some extent by the excitation mechanisms presented by the core firms in the cooperation system. Therefore, the drawn conclusions should be useful for the core manufactures’ implementing various strategies to maintain or enhance the cooperation for radical innovation in industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study aims at addressing a problem on icing detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV for short) because traditional icing detection methods are costly and bulky. Toward this end, a pitot-based icing detection method is proposed, and the effect of different types of icing blocking on pressure is firstly reported. An icing detection system based on the pitot tube is designed and fabricated. Icing wind tunnel results indicate that if the pitot tube is blocked by glaze ice, then the total pressure of the pitot tube decreases gradually and remains unchanged and less than static pressure. However, if the pitot tube is blocked by rime ice, then the total pressure drops to the same level as the static pressure. If the pitot tube is blocked by non-ice organic materials, then the total pressure suddenly drops to the same level as the static pressure and remains unchanged. Furthermore, if the pitot tube contacts the water droplets but does not freeze, the total pressure output value fluctuates slightly. The effect of icing on pressure is caused by differences in ice microstructure, temperature, and flow velocity. At the same time, the proposed method offers a facile and low-cost approach for UAV icing detection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As an important structural system for effectively improving power delivered to the load (PDL) and power transmission range, multiple-transmitter (TX) and single-receiver (RX) wireless power transfer (WPT) system is gaining more and more attention in both academic circles and the industrial fields. Based on the Lagrange multiplier method, this paper first provides a current- and voltage-optimized circuit scheme to maximize the PDL of the multiple-TX WPT system. Then, for a determined WPT system, the current-optimized circuit scheme is proposed to maximize the PDL effectively with constant source voltages and feeding currents for TXs. While voltage-optimized circuit scheme can effectively adjust the source voltages and feeding currents and maintain the same level of input power and PDL as a current-optimized solution. Through comparative study, the voltage-optimized solution shows its advantages in adjustable source voltage and feeding current without any degradation of PDL. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are confirmed by the results of full-wave electromagnetic simulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Results from major clinical trials have shown significant cardiorenal-protective benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), leading to increased popularity. A rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which presents more covertly but has been described. Identification and report of modifiable risk factors would be an important step in helping clinicians appropriately counsel patients. In this case report, we present DKA in a patient on an SGLT2 inhibitor and ketogenic diet (KD). A 47-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled T2DM on metformin and empagliflozin presented to the emergency department (ED) with several days of pharyngitis, dyspnea, emesis, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Of note, one month prior to this event, he presented to the ED with malaise and was found to have an anion gap of 21, a bicarbonate level of 13 mmol/L, a pH level of 7.22, 3+ ketonuria, and a glucose level of 7 mmol/L (127 mg/dl). Additional workup was negative, and findings were attributed to his KD. His use of empagliflozin was not identified on his medication list. At second presentation, the patient was tachypneic and tachycardic and had mild abdominal tenderness. Labs revealed anion gap 28, bicarbonate 5 mmol/l, pH 6.94, 3+ ketonuria, glucose 14.9 mmol/L (269 mg/dl), and beta-hydroxybutyrate 8.9 mmol/L. The patient was diagnosed with DKA and was treated accordingly. With closure of anion gap, the patient was transitioned to insulin and metformin, and his empagliflozin was discontinued indefinitely. Before prescribing this medication class, physicians should inquire about low-carbohydrate diets given the higher risk for DKA, though knowledge of this risk is still not widespread.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ford Lumban Gaol</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Tokuro Matsuo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Implications of sensor technology on new product introduction requires critical decisions on divergent marketing and operational aspects. In this paper, we employed the Bass model for a new product that used the sensor technology diffusion from the perspective of the Wagner-Whitin lot-sizing model which discusses this matter related to suitability of sensor technology on the market and operational dimensions. The objective of this study is to propose an uncertain fuzzy approach to specify the new product that applied the sensor technology introduction’s optimum time, price, production scheduling, and rate simultaneously. This model will be applied to analyze the impact of sensor technology diffusion on the market acceptance and some operational parameters, for instance, total customer population, price elasticities, startup and maintenance costs, the unit’s variable cost and research and development costs on optimized benefit, and the product’s optimized lifespan. In this experiment, we have inspiration from the version of the Sale et al. (2017) model which considers uncertainty by using fuzzy triangular numbers and performing the alpha cut method. Moreover, in this research, variable cost is considered as a Cobb-Douglas function. Initially, in Research Methodology, mathematical modeling is applied, wherein utilizing simulation and the experimental design method, data were generated. Eventually, using LINGO optimization software, the problem was solved, and for further examinations considering the existence of various parameters, design of experiment (DoE) by Design-Expert 8 software and response surface methodology was adopted to analyze and optimize the problem’s parameters. The results indicated that the objective function’s climax occurs when the higher limit of alpha being 0.7 is assumed; hence, the optimum state of demand belongs to this amount of alpha.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Steered fermentation by microorganisms gives great added value in the nutritional quality of local food. Ginger rhizome naturally contains a myriad of bioactive compounds including polyphenol and flavonoids. The aim of this work was to ferment the ginger juice, to evaluate the biochemical parameters of ginger wine, and to understand the involvement of microorganisms in the bioincrease of polyphenol compounds. Titratable acidity and pH values were determined and showed that pH is around 1.6 at the end of the fermentation when the acidity is around 6.431 g/L. Using colorimetric assay, the total polyphenolic and flavonoid compounds were evaluated throughout the fermentation. The variation of the polyphenol and flavonoid concentrations of the unsweetened sample was around 10.18 to 14.64 mg Eq AG/g and 1.394 to 2.224 mg Eq Cat/g Ms, but those from the sweet sample were around 10.82 to 18.34 mg Eq AG/g Ms and 1.311 to 2.290 mg Eq Cat/g. Using one-step PCR, multiplex techniques with specific primers, with yeast-like phenotype 27.27% (6), have been assigned among 22 isolates to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using PCR multiplex techniques, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been identified. Together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we showed that Bacillus sp. are able to secrete enzymatic landscape with some activities up to 50% including cellulase, amylase, pectinase, and protease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) is a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive pontobulbar palsy, sensory and motor neuron degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, and optic atrophy. As riboflavin (RF) is the precursor of FAD and FMN, we hypothesize that both mitochondrial and peroxisomal energy metabolism pathways involving flavoproteins could be directly affected in RTD, thus impacting cellular redox status. In the present work, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from RTD patients to investigate morphofunctional features, focusing on mitochondrial and peroxisomal compartments. Using this model, we document the following RTD-associated alterations: (i) abnormal colony-forming ability and loss of cell-cell contacts, revealed by light, electron, and confocal microscopy, using tight junction marker ZO-1; (ii) mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities, involving shape, number, and intracellular distribution of the organelles, as assessed by focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM); (iii) redox imbalance, with high levels of superoxide anion, as assessed by MitoSOX assay accompanied by abnormal mitochondrial polarization state, evaluated by JC-1 staining; (iv) altered immunofluorescence expression of antioxidant systems, namely, glutathione, superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, and catalase, as assessed by quantitatively evaluated confocal microscopy; and (v) peroxisomal downregulation, as demonstrated by levels and distribution of fatty acyl β-oxidation enzymes. RF supplementation results in amelioration of cell phenotype and rescue of redox status, which was associated to improved ultrastructural features of mitochondria, thus strongly supporting patient treatment with RF, to restore mitochondrial- and peroxisomal-related aspects of energy dysmetabolism and oxidative stress in RTD syndrome.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The use of nutraceuticals during cancer treatment is a long-lasting debate. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline quaternary alkaloid extracted from a variety of medicinal plants. BBR has been shown to have therapeutic effects in different pathologies, particularly in cancer, where it affects pathways involved in tumor progression. In neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial childhood solid tumor, BBR, reduces tumor growth by regulating both stemness and differentiation features and by inducing apoptosis. At the same time, the inhibition of β-adrenergic signaling leads to a reduction in growth and increase of differentiation of neuroblastoma. In this review, we summarize the possible beneficial effects of BBR in counteracting tumor growth and progression in various types of cancer and, in particular, in neuroblastoma. However, BBR administration, besides its numerous beneficial effects, presents a few side effects due to inhibition of MAO A enzyme in neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, herein, we proposed a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome side effects of BBR administration consisting of concomitant administration of BBR together with β-blockers in neuroblastoma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are an essential part of the human eye because they not only mediate and control the transfer of fluids and solutes but also protect the retina against photooxidative damage and renew photoreceptor cells through phagocytosis. However, their function necessitates cumulative exposure to the sun resulting in UV damage, which may lead to the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Several studies have shown that UVB induces direct DNA damage and oxidative stress in RPE cells by increasing ROS and dysregulating endogenous antioxidants. Activation of different signaling pathways connected to inflammation, cell cycle arrest, and intrinsic apoptosis was reported as well. Besides that, essential functions like phagocytosis, osmoregulation, and water permeability of RPE cells were also affected. Although the melanin within RPE cells can act as a photoprotectant, this photoprotection decreases with age. Nevertheless, the changes in lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) and autophagic activity or application of bioactive compounds from natural products can reverse the detrimental effect of UVB. Additionally, in vivo studies on the whole retina demonstrated that UVB irradiation induces gene and protein level dysregulation, indicating cellular stress and aberrations in the chromosome level. Morphological changes like retinal depigmentation and drusen formation were noted as well which is similar to the etiology of AMD, suggesting the connection of UVB damage with AMD. Therefore, future studies, which include mechanism studies via in vitro or in vivo and other potential bioactive compounds, should be pursued for a better understanding of the involvement of UVB in AMD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photovoltaic solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources. However, the production of this energy is nonlinear and varies depending on atmospheric parameters. Therefore, the operating point of the photovoltaic panel (PV) does not always coincide with the maximum power point (MPP). A mechanism that allows the research of the maximum power point known as maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is then needed to yield the maximum power permanently. This paper presents an intelligent control technique based on the ESC (Extremum Seeking Control) method for MPPT under varying environmental conditions. The proposed technique is an improvement of the classical ESC algorithm with an additional loop in order to increase the convergence speed. A detailed stability analysis is given not only to ensure a faster convergence of the system towards an adjustable neighborhood of the optimum point but also to confirm a better robustness of the proposed method. In addition, simulation results using Matlab/Simulink environment and experimental results using Arduino board are presented to demonstrate that the proposed modified ESC method performs better than the classical ESC under varying atmospheric conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Tauqeer Safdar Malik</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mohd Hilmi Hasan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the existing network-layered architectural stack of Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Network (CRAHN), channel selection is performed at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. However, routing is done on the network layer. Due to this limitation, the Secondary/Unlicensed Users (SUs) need to access the channel information from the MAC layer whenever the channel switching event occurred during the data transmission. This issue delayed the channel selection process during the immediate routing decision for the channel switching event to continue the transmission. In this paper, a protocol is proposed to implement the channel selection decisions at the network layer during the routing process. The decision is based on past and expected future routing decisions of Primary Users (PUs). A learning agent operating in the cross-layer mode of the network-layered architectural stack is implemented in the spectrum mobility manager to pass the channel information to the network layer. This information is originated at the MAC layer. The channel selection is performed on the basis of reinforcement learning algorithms such as No-External Regret Learning, Q-Learning, and Learning Automata. This leads to minimizing the channel switching events and user interferences in the Reinforcement Learning- (RL-) based routing protocol. Simulations are conducted using Cognitive Radio Cognitive Network simulator based on Network Simulator (NS-2). The simulation results showed that the proposed routing protocol performed better than all the other comparative routing protocols in terms of number of channel switching events, average data rate, packet collision, packet loss, and end-to-end delay. The proposed routing protocol implies the improved Quality of Service (QoS) of the delay sensitive and real-time networks such as Cellular and Tele Vision (TV) networks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Kratom is a synthetic opioid that is federally unregulated and thus available for purchase through online retail and smoke shops in most states. Due to its availability, there is concern for misuse in the pediatric population. There is existing literature describing toxicity of kratom in adults; yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are no cases describing kratom toxicity in the pediatric population. Thus, we present the case of kratom overdose in a pediatric patient.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Topic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of conbercept in PCV, which will optimize the management for PCV patients. Clinical Relevance. The use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a subtype of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), has been well established in randomized clinical trials. This meta-analysis has evaluated the efficacy of a novel anti-VEGF agent, conbercept, in the management of PCV using ranibizumab and aflibercept as the reference agents. Methods. Thirty studies with 1308 eyes were identified and included in this study. The primary outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and secondary outcomes were optical coherence tomography characteristics and polyp regression rates. The pooled results were calculated by the random-effect or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity of the data. Results. Despite a large standard deviation in means (SMD) improvement for BCVA and central retinal thickness (CRT) in the conbercept group, there was no statistically significant difference in the other outcomes compared to ranibizumab and aflibercept. However, there was a greater polyp regression rate in the conbercept group at 12 months. Conclusions. This systematic review indicates that conbercept may achieve similar BCVA and CRT improvements as ranibizumab and aflibercept, with a superior rate of polyp regression at 12 months.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Various polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-) based methods with varying positivity rates were designed to detect the Helicobacter pylori babA2 gene. To compare different primer sets, babA2 prevalence was determined in 279 H. pylori-positive pediatric samples using the 832 bp, 139 bp, and 271 bp PCR primer sets, resulting in 34.0%, 51.3%, and 79.6% prevalence of the babA2 gene, respectively. The babA2 status determined using the 832 bp and 139 bp PCR primer sets significantly correlated with bacterial density and activity of inflammation, whereas no such correlations were found using the 271 bp PCR primer set. The 139 and 832 bp PCR primer sets concordantly detected the babA2 gene in 93 cases; however, in comparison to the 832 bp PCR primer set, the 139 bp PCR primer set detected additional 50 babA2 cases, whereas only two 832 bp positive cases were missed. The 271 bp PCR primer set missed 32 babA2 cases that were 832 bp and/or 139 bp PCR positive, but tested solely positive in 109 cases. Interestingly, cloning of a subset of 271 bp PCR positive samples revealed amplification of the babA/B gene chimera. Hence, in our opinion, the 271 bp PCR protocol is not a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting the babA2 gene in children. Our results reaffirm previous observations that the use of certain babA2 PCR primer sets can significantly impact estimation of the prevalence and clinical relevance of the H. pylori babA2 gene in children, suggesting babA2 detection methods should be carefully selected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common types of primary bone tumors in early adolescence with unsatisfied prognosis. Aberrant DNA methylation had been demonstrated to be related to tumorigenesis and progression of multiple cancers and could serve as the potential biomarkers for the prognosis of human cancers. In conclusion, this study identified 18 downregulated hypomethylation genes and 52 upregulated hypomethylation genes in OS by integrating the analysis the GSE97529 and GSE42572 datasets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that OS-specific methylated genes were involved in regulating multiple biological processes, including chemical synaptic transmission, transcription, response to drug, and regulating immune response. KEGG pathway analysis showed that OS-specific methylated genes were associated with the regulation of Hippo, cAMP calcium, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways. By analyzing R2 datasets, this study showed that the dysregulation of these OS-specific methylated genes was associated with the metastasis-free survival time in patients with OS, including CBLN4, ANKMY1, BZW1, KRTCAP3, GZMB, KRTDAP, LY9, PFKFB2, PTPN22, and CLDN7. This study provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression and OS and novel biomarkers for the prognosis of OS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Data fusion can reduce the data communication time between sensor nodes, reduce energy consumption, and prolong the lifetime of the network, making it an important research focus in the field of heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs). Normal sensor nodes are susceptible to external environmental interferences, which affect the measurement results. In addition, raw data contain redundant information. The transmission of redundant information consumes excess energy, thereby reducing the lifetime of the network. We propose a data fusion method based on an extreme learning machine optimized by particle swarm optimization for HWSNs. The spatiotemporal correlation between the data of the HWSNs is determined, and the extreme learning machine method is used to process the data collected by the sensor nodes in the hierarchical routing structure of the HWSN. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the input weight matrix and the hidden layer bias of the extreme learning machine. An output weight matrix is created to reduce the number of hidden layer nodes and improve the generalization ability of the model. The data fusion model fuses the original data collected by the sensor nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces network energy consumption and improves the lifetime of the network, the efficiency of data fusion, and the reliability of data transmission compared with other data fusion methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its predecessor products, choline, L-carnitine, and betaine, were reported to be associated with cardiovascular events risk. However, the association of TMAO and its predecessors with extent of artery stenosis in coronary artery disease (CAD) and in different gender is still unknown. Our aim is to investigate the association of plasma TMAO and its predecessors in CAD and extent of artery lesion in different gender. Methods. 94 CAD patients and 75 healthy controls (CON) were enrolled. Fasting plasma TMAO, choline, L-carnitine, and betaine were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results. Elevated plasma TMAO but not choline, L-carnitine, or betaine was observed in CAD (1.46(0.8–2.32) μM) and severe artery stenosis patients (S) (1.62(0.91–2.81) μM) compared with controls and mild artery stenosis (M) (1.18(0.67–1.7) μM in CON; 1.27(0.77–1.82) μM in M, p&lt;0.05). TMAO was an independent risk factor of CAD and severe artery stenosis (CAD : OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.07–3.09, p=0.03; S : OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.01–1.84, p=0.04). TMAO was more sensitive in diagnosing CAD and severe artery stenosis from controls in men rather than in women by ROC analysis (AUC for men and women in CAD: 0.64 versus 0.57; AUC for men and women in S: 0.64 versus 0.58), while the combined four metabolites greatly improved diagnostic accuracy in women with CAD and severe artery stenosis (AUC in CAD: 0.64, AUC in S: 0.68). Conclusion. The associations of TMAO with CAD and severe artery stenosis were sex-related. TMAO alone was more powerful in determining CAD and artery stenosis in men than women, while a combination of TMAO, choline, L-carnitine, and betaine could be potential biomarkers for diagnosing CAD and artery stenosis in both men and women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Growing evidence suggests that fibrotic changes can be observed in atrial fibrillation (AF) in both atria. Quantification of the scar burden during electroanatomical mapping might have important therapeutic and prognostic consequences. However, as the current invasive treatment of AF is focused on the left atrium (LA), the role of the right atrium (RA) is less well understood. We aimed to characterize the clinical determinates of the RA low-voltage burden and its relation to the LA scaring. Methods. We have included 36 patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF in a prospective observational study. In addition to LA mapping and ablation, high-density RA bipolar voltage maps (HD-EAM) were also reconstructed. The extent of the diseased RA tissue (≤0.5 mV) was quantified using the voltage histogram analysis tool (CARTO®3, Biosense Webster). Results. The percentage of RA diseased tissue burden was significantly higher in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 p=0.0305, higher indexed LA volume on the CTA scan and on the HD‐EAM (p=0.0223 and p=0.0064, respectively), or higher indexed RA volume on the HD‐EAM p=0.0026. High RA diseased tissue burden predicted the presence of high LA diseased tissue burden (OR = 7.1, CI (95%): 1.3–38.9, p=0.0145), and there was a significant correlation of the same (r = 0.6461, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions. Determining the extent of the right atrial low-voltage burden might give useful clinical information. According to our results, the diseased tissue burden correlates well between the two atria: the right atrium mirrors the left atrium.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. FeNO has been used as a marker for Th2-mediated airway inflammation in asthma. There is evidence which recommends the use of this biomarker in asthma management. Little is known about whether the FeNO test alone or in combination with the ACT score can reflect asthma control in Vietnamese patients. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in asthmatic patients (≥18 years old) recruited at the University Medical Center, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from March 2016 to March 2017. Asthma control levels were assessed following the GINA 2017 guidelines, and FeNO was measured by a Niox Mino device. FeNO cut-offs predicting asthma control status were determined using the ROC curve analysis. The combination of FeNO and ACT was investigated in detecting well-controlled and uncontrolled asthma. The results of the study are as follows: 278 patients with 68% females, mean age of 44 years, and mean asthma duration of 10 years were analyzed. All patients were treated following step 2 to 4 of GINA guidelines. Mean (SD) FeNO was 30.6 (24) ppb. Patients with uncontrolled (16%), partly controlled (29%), and well-controlled asthma (55%) had a median (IQR) FeNO of 50.0 (74), 25.0 (23), and 21.0 (22.3) ppb, respectively, and the mean of FeNO in the uncontrolled group was significantly higher than that in other groups (p&lt;0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for FeNO detecting uncontrolled asthma was 0.730 with an optimal cut-off point of FeNO &gt; 50 ppb, and this AUC increased to 0.89 when combining FeNO and ACT. The AUC for FeNO detecting well-controlled asthma was 0.601 with an optimal cut-off point of FeNO &lt;25 ppb and this AUC increased to 0.78 if combining FeNO and ACT. Conclusions. FeNO can predict asthma control status with an estimated cut-off point of &lt;25 ppb for well-controlled and &gt;50 ppb for uncontrolled asthma. The combination of FeNO and ACT provides better information regarding asthma control than FeNO alone, and this combination is useful to predict asthma control statuses in asthmatic patients in Viet Nam.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Priapism is a rare urological emergency. It is rarely a telltale sign of myeloid leukemia. We report two cases of acute myeloid leukemia in a child and chronic myeloid leukemia in a young adult presenting with priapism. Puncture irrigation of the corpora cavernosa followed by systemic treatment to lower the hyperviscosity of the blood due to leukemia provided optimal outcome. Prompt emergency management is required to lower the complication of erectile dysfunction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aim of the Study. The present study aimed to establish a metabolic profile and to investigate the changes of endogenous metabolites in diabetic mice treated with LWDHW. We further investigated the metabolic mechanism of action for the hypoglycemic activity of LWDHW and its possible role in reducing the risk of renal failure in type 2 diabetic mice. Materials and Methods. MKR mice were used for the development of diabetes with high-fat diet feeding. These mice were further injected with streptozocin (STZ) to aggravate kidney failure. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR values) were determined to validate the successful establishment of diabetic models with desired kidney dysfunction. Metabolomics approach coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and random forest (RF) algorithm was proposed to discover the metabolic differences among model group and control group as well as to examine the therapeutic efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan (LWDHW), in diabetes and associated kidney failure. Results. Some metabolites such as 3-hydroxybutyric acid, citric acid, hexadecanoic acid, and octadecanoic acid showed significant differences between the control group and model group. Treatment with LWDHW resulted in a significant decrease in FBG and ACR values. These results suggested that LWDHW could have beneficial effects in diabetes-associated renal failure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The mechanical properties of rocks under low to intermediate strain rate are of great importance for seismic engineering, rock impact, and blasting excavation. To study the strength and deformation characteristics of sandstone subjected to low-medium speed impact loading, the complete stress-strain relationships of uniaxial compression at strain rates of 10−2∼55 s−1 were obtained utilizing MTS and drop weight impact test devices. It is indicated that the dynamic compressive strength of sandstone in the range of intermediate strain rate increases approximately linearly with the strain rate under the quasi-static loading condition, while increasing nonlinearly under the dynamic loading condition. The deformation and fracture process of sandstone still consists of pore compaction stage, elastic deformation stage, instable microcrack propagation stage, and brittle fracture stage. The peak stress, critical strain, and residual strain increase with an increase in the strain rate, and the corresponding fracture mode changes from shear failure to split failure. The evolution law of total absorbed strain energy with deformation coincides with that of stored elastic strain energy for sandstone at the intermediate strain rate. The effect of the strain rate on elastic strain energy is more significant than that of dissipated strain energy. Furthermore, both the brittleness and fracture degree of sandstone become more remarkable with the strain rate increasing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material is generally under a large amount of aged asphalt coated on the surface of the aggregates, which often limits its (RAP) wide application. Bioasphalt is a renewable material with constituent components that are comparable to regular petroleum asphalt and has the potential to rejuvenate the performance of the aged asphalt in RAP materials. In this laboratory study, the optimum bioasphalt dosage for rejuvenating and optimizing warm-mix rejuvenated bioasphalt (WBA) performance, in the presence of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and naphthenic oil additives, was investigated. The laboratory test results of the single-factor and orthogonal experiment indicated that the optimal dosage of bioasphalt in WBA was 30% at 4% SBS and 10% naphthenic oil, respectively. The test results further indicated that the WBA’s ductility properties were highly responsive to the bioasphalt dosage. Naphthenic oil, on the other hand, had the greatest impact on the WBA fluidity. Likewise, the Brookfield viscosity experimentation showed that the fluidity of WBA and aged asphalt with different contents at 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%, respectively, satisfactorily met the Chinese construction requirements. The adhesion test indicated excellent adhesion and good moisture stability properties for WBA. The resultant PG grades of WBA blended with 40% and 70% aged asphalt were PG 64-34 and PG 70-22, respectively. Microstructure and surface morphology analysis showed carbonyl absorption peaks with high rejuvenation and surface-crack repair potential for the WBA over the control asphalt that was evaluated in the study.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Carlos Humberto Rubio Rascón</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Alberto Díaz Díaz</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Axel Fernando Domínguez Alvarado</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper presents a model called SAM-FG (stress approach model of functionally graded shells) for linear elastic, thin, and moderately thick shells made of functionally graded materials. The model is an extension of the SAM-H model, originally created for homogeneous shells. Assuming that the material is orthotropic and that one of its orthotropic directions is the thickness direction, the extension consists in considering that the 3D compliance tensor may depend on the thickness coordinate. The model starts with a tunable polynomial approximation of the 3D stress field that contains the same generalized forces as SAM-H. This stress approximation verifies the 3D equilibrium equations and the stress boundary conditions at the faces of the shell. As in SAM-H, 5 generalized displacements appear in SAM-FG. By applying the Hellinger–Reissner functional and Reissner’s variational method, the generalized forces, strains, and equations in SAM-FG turn out to be the same as in SAM-H, except for the generalized constitutive equations. To prove the accuracy of the model, SAM-FG is first applied to a simply supported, functionally graded plate and its results are compared to other models. To validate the model for shell-like structures, SAM-FG results are compared to those obtained with solid finite element calculations for three case studies of structures subjected to an internal pressure. The first one deals with a hollow sphere made of an isotropic functionally graded material. The second case considers a hollow cylinder made of an orthotropic functionally graded material. In the last case, a catenoid with an isotropic functionally graded material is studied. In all cases, the mean displacements are correctly predicted, even if the main purpose of the SAM-FG model is not to calculate these fields accurately. The stress field approximations are very accurate, and since the implementation of the shell model in a finite element code would imply 5 degrees of freedom per node, SAM-FG is a good alternative to solid finite element calculations for the structural analysis of functionally graded shells with a reasonable computational cost.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The number of super-large-span tunnels is increasing in both new construction and reconstruction projects in China recently. In super-large-span tunneling engineering, the deformation properties and mechanical behaviors of tunnel portal structure are more complex than those of common tunnel due to the flatter shape and larger construction span. The mechanical behaviors of rock mass change in response to different sequential excavation methods and supporting parameters. The upper bench CD method has been gradually applied in the construction of super-large-span tunnels in China. In this paper, the design parameters for the supporting structure of super-large-span tunnel were studied by the field monitoring and numerical modeling in a case study of Laohushan tunnel. It was found that the crown settlement was larger than the clearance convergence, and the stress of arch was greater than that of the side wall in tunnel portal section. The invert structure was flat with small curvature. Therefore, the shotcrete was mainly subjected to tensile stress. The use of H200 × 200 steel rib with spacing of 60 cm and C25 shotcrete with thickness of 30 cm is recommended. The results of this paper provide basis for the development of design specifications and construction standards for super-large-span tunnels and provide reference for similar projects in the future.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy achieves higher eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori. High level of bismuth in blood may result in damage of many organs. Wei Bi Mei is a new bismuth-containing drug combining chemicals and Chinese medicine portions. The present research is to study the pharmacokinetics of bismuth to evaluate the safety and rational use of Wei Bi Mei granules. Material and Methods. Seven healthy Chinese adult subjects were enrolled in this research, which included a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study. Wei Bi Mei granules were administered orally to the subjects at corresponding time. Blood and urine were collected. All samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results. For single-dose Wei Bi Mei granules administration, the mean time to peak concentration (tmax) of bismuth was 2.29 ± 0.76 h, and the mean peak concentration (Cmax) of bismuth was 0.85 ± 0.55 ng/mL. For multiple-dose Wei Bi Mei granules administration, the Cmax was 2.25 ± 1.18 ng/mL at day two, and the volume of distribution (Vd) was (22.97 ± 9.82) × 103 L. The urinary excretion of bismuth was the fastest during the first two days, with a mean excretion rate of 3.84 ± 1.23 ng/h. The bismuth concentration in urine was significantly reduced at day 16. Conclusion. Bismuth has a washout period of approximately two months. The concentration of bismuth in blood was far less than the “safe level.” Thus, Wei Bi Mei is a highly safe therapeutic medicine, with a good clinical application value. Wei Bi Mei should be recommended more widely for use in bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The behaviors of vortex rings for free jet and synthetic jet with various Reynolds numbers and Strouhal numbers are numerically studied by the k-ε model. The positions of the leading vortex of free jet are investigated under the three different conditions, and the effect of Strouhal number on the vortex ring is analyzed in detail. The results show that different Reynolds numbers lead to different positions for the shedding of the vortex rings. During the movement of the vortex rings, the symmetry of the vortex ring in synthetic jet retains in good state, and the vortex rings do not break up with well-arranged distributions. The distance between two adjacent vortex rings near the synthetic jet exit has the close link between the Strouhal number yet is independent of the Reynolds numbers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients with impaired renal function have a higher risk of mortality, and often progress to end-stage renal disease. The study aims to determine the prevalence of kidney disease and investigate the relationship between various factors and impaired renal function in a large population of patients with T2DM. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 30,377 patients from a nationwide diabetes study involving 602 Thai hospitals. Impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was defined as &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between standard risk factors and impaired GFR. Results. The prevalence of impaired GFR in a T2DM population was 39.2%. After adjusting for multiple risk factors, advanced age (adjusted OR 11.69 (95%CI=3.13 to 43.61)), macroalbuminuria (adjusted OR 3.54 (95%CI=1.50 to 8.40)), high serum uric acid (adjusted OR 2.06 (95%CI=1.73 to 2.46)), systolic BP 130-139 mmHg (adjusted OR 3.21 (95%CI=1.30 to 7.96)), hemoglobinA1C (HA1C) &lt;6% (adjusted OR 3.71 (95%CI=1.65 to 8.32)), and HA1C &gt;7% (adjusted OR 2.53 (95%CI=1.38 to 4.63)) were found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of impaired GFR among T2DM patients. Conclusion. Almost 40% of patients with T2DM in a nationwide cross-sectional study in Thailand had impaired GFR. Advanced age, albuminuria, hyperuricemia, hypertension, HA1C &lt;6%, and HA1C &gt;7% were independently associated with increased prevalence of impaired GFR.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Both abacavir- (ABC-) based and zidovudine- (AZT-) based regimens are widely utilized for managing HIV infection in children. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data regarding their immunological response and associated risk factors in Ethiopia. Methods. A retrospective hospital-based cohort study was conducted on HIV-infected children in Jimma Medical Center (JMC). A total of 179 records were reviewed by including data from November 2015 to April 2017. Data were collected on sociodemographic, clinical characteristics of patients and drug-related variables. Data analysis was done using STATA 13.1. Mixed-effect linear regression was performed to assess the difference in CD4+ changes between groups adjusting for baseline characteristics. The change in predicted CD4 count attributed to each regimen was also assessed by marginal analysis. P&lt;0.05 for slope of the random-effect linear regression was used as an indicator for the presence of association. Result. Of 179 patients, 98 (54.7%) were females. The mean (±SD) duration of follow-up was 939.8 ± 478.3 and 984.92 ± 453.1 days for ABC and AZT groups, respectively. AZT group had a significant CD4+ count gain per visit compared with their ABC counterparts ((β = 20.51, 95% CI [6.37–34.65]), P=0.004) over time. The regimen AZT + 3TC + LPV/r tended to have an excellent predicted CD4+ lymphocyte count change relative to all other regimens, while ABC + 3TC + LPV/r had the least immunologic recovery (margins 338.0 cells/mm3 versus 249.13 cells/mm3 (P&lt;0.001)). Baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count, ART group, WHO clinical stages, and viral load were independent predictors for CD4+ change overtime. Conclusion. AZT-based regimens seem to have better immunological response compared to ABC-based regimens. Immunologic response was described worse in patients with a viral load of &gt;1000copies/ml, low baseline CD4+ count, advanced WHO clinical stages, and ABC-containing regimens. Further study is needed to clarify these aspects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bistatic radar imaging can overcome limitations of monostatic radar imaging and obtain abundant target feature information; thus, it is followed with interest. Different from bistatic inverse synthetic aperture radar (Bi-ISAR) imaging, bistatic radar coincidence imaging (Bi-RCI) provides a new tack on the bistatic radar imaging technique. In this paper, a Bi-RCI based on multiple measurement vectors (MMV) for rotating cone-shaped targets is proposed to realize Bi-RCI coherent processing and improve imaging performance. Based on the mixed mode signals, a MMV parametric model is established and measurement number coarse selection is proposed. Finally, a modified sparse Bayesian learning (MSBL) algorithm is introduced to reconstruct the target image. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and the superiority of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Environmental concerns due to excessive use of synthetic or petroleum-based materials have encouraged scientists to develop novel, sustainable, and multifunctional material using abundant lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, a study was conducted on the isolation of cellulose from wheat straw using two different methods: acidified sodium chlorite and alkaline hydrogen peroxide. A comparative study was carried out based on the yield and properties of extracted cellulose. The final product (after treatments) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for the identification of properties. Both the treatments isolated pure white color cellulose. However, the yield of cellulose isolated through acidified sodium chlorite treatment (81.4%) was higher than alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment (79%). Moreover, no huge difference was observed in the crystallinity and thermal properties of extracted cellulose.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The metastatic potential of colorectal cancer (CRC) is intensively promoted by the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a paracrine manner. As a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced and involved in CRC, the same scenario where integrin αvβ6 also becomes upregulated. However, the relationship between IL-6 and integrin αvβ6 as well as their involvement in the crosstalk between CRC and TME remains largely unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression of IL-6 and integrin β6 in CRC samples. The mutually promotive interaction between CRC and TME was further determined by an indirect coculture system. CRC cells could augment the secretion of IL-6 from fibroblasts, which in return induced invasion and integrin β6 expression of CRC cells. Through the classic IL-6 receptor/STAT-3 signaling pathway, IL-6 mediated the upregulation of integrin β6, which was involved in the invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CRC cells induced by IL-6. Taken together, our results reveal a paracrine crosstalk between IL-6 signals originating from the TME and increased the integrin β6 level of CRC. IL-6 induces CRC invasion via upregulation of integrin β6 through the IL-6 receptor/STAT-3 signaling pathway. Combined inhibition of IL-6 along with integrin β6-targeted strategy may indicate new directions for antitumor strategies for CRC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The main objective of this paper is to introduce a new class of preinvex functions which is called as n-polynomial preinvex functions of a higher order. As applications of this class of functions, we discuss several new variants of trapezium-like inequalities. In order to obtain the main results of the paper, we use the concepts and techniques of k-fractional calculus. We also discuss some special cases of the obtained results which show that the main results of the paper are quite unifying one.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The energy conversion in rocks has an important significance for evaluation of the stability and safety of rock engineering. In this paper, some uniaxial compression tests for fifteen different rocks were performed. The evolution characteristics of the total energy, elastic energy, and dissipated energy for the fifteen rocks were studied. The dissipation energy coefficient was introduced to study the evolution characteristics of rock. The evolution of the dissipation energy coefficient for different rocks was investigated. The linear interrelations of the dissipation energy coefficients and the yield strength and peak strength were explored. The method was proposed to determine the strength of rock using the dissipation energy coefficients. The results show that the evolution of the dissipation energy coefficient exhibits significant deformation properties of rock. The dissipation energy coefficients linearly increase with the compaction strength, but decrease with the yield strength and peak strength. Moreover, the dissipation energy coefficient can be used to determine the rock burst proneness and crack propagation in rocks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. This study was aimed at exploring the effect of long noncoding RNA LINC00324 (LINC00324) on gastric cancer (GC) and the potential molecular mechanisms. Methods. The expression of LINC00324 and miR-3200-5p in GC tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR. LINC00324 was silenced in GC cells by transfection of si-LINC00324. Then, the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells were analyzed by MTT, wound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The interactions between LINC00324 and miR-3200-5p and between miR-3200-5p and BCAT1 were determined by a dual-luciferase reporter and/or RNA pull-down assay. Results. The expression of LINC00324 was upregulated in GC cells and tissues, but miR-3200-5p was downregulated. Silencing of LINC00324 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. LINC00324 directly targeted miR-3200-5p, and miR-3200-5p directly targeted BCAT1. si-LINC00324 negatively regulated BCAT1 expression via binding to miR-3200-5p. Furthermore, silencing of LINC00324 reversed the promoting effects of BCAT1 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. Conclusion. Silencing of LINC00324 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells through regulating the miR-3200-5p/BCAT1 axis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The nonlinear subharmonic resonance of an orthotropic rectangular laminated composite plate is studied. Based on the theory of high-order shear laminates, von Karman's geometric relation for the large deformation of plates, and Hamilton's principle, the nonlinear dynamic equations of a rectangular, orthotropic composite laminated plate subjected to the transverse harmonic excitation are established. According to the displacement boundary conditions, the modal functions that satisfy the boundary conditions of the rectangular plate are selected. The two-degree-of-freedom ordinary differential equations that describe the vibration of the rectangular plate are obtained by the Galerkin method. The multiscale method is used to obtain an approximate solution to the resonance problem. Both the amplitude-frequency equation and the average equations in the Cartesian coordinate form are obtained. The amplitude-frequency curves, bifurcation diagrams, phase diagrams, and time history diagrams of the rectangular plate under different parameters are obtained numerically. The influence of relevant parameters, such as excitation amplitude, tuning parameter, and damping coefficient, on the nonlinear dynamic response of the system is analyzed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate masticatory muscle electrical activity in patients with pain-related and pain-free temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) as well as in subjects with no TMD. Methods. Ninety children with mixed dentition were recruited to the study. Of this total, 30 subjects were diagnosed with pain-related TMD (TMD-P), 30 with pain-free TMD (TMD-PF), and 30 without TMD. We used Axis I of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) to assess the presence of TMD in the examined children. The electromyographical (EMG) potentials of the temporalis and masseter muscles were measured with a DAB-Bluetooth Instrument (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) at rest and during maximum voluntary clenching (MVC). Results. An analysis of the EMG recordings showed statistically significant intergroup differences in masticatory muscle electrical activity at rest and during MVC. Significantly higher rest temporalis muscle activity was noted in pain-related TMD subjects compared with that children from the pain-free TMD and non-TMD groups, as well as in TMD-PF children in relation to those without TMD. The EMG potentials of the temporalis muscle during MVC were much lower in patients with TMD-P than in pain-free TMD and non-TMD subjects. Masseter muscle activity at rest in the TMD-pain group was significantly greater, and masseter muscle EMG potentials during clenching were markedly lower than in patients with no TMD diagnosis. Conclusion. The use of electromyography to assess masticatory muscle function revealed alterations in the pattern of temporalis and masseter muscle activity in patients with pain-related TMD compared with the pain-free subjects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, the researchers have witnessed the important role of air gesture recognition in human-computer interactive (HCI), smart home, and virtual reality (VR). The traditional air gesture recognition method mainly depends on external equipment (such as special sensors and cameras) whose costs are high and also with a limited application scene. In this paper, we attempt to utilize channel state information (CSI) derived from a WLAN physical layer, a Wi-Fibased air gesture recognition system, namely, WiNum, which solves the problems of users’ privacy and energy consumption compared with the approaches using wearable sensors and depth cameras. In the process of recognizing the WiNum method, the collected raw data of CSI should be screened, among which can reflect the gesture motion. Meanwhile, the screened data should be preprocessed by noise reduction and linear transformation. After preprocessing, the joint of amplitude information and phase information is extracted, to match and recognize different air gestures by using the S-DTW algorithm which combines dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) and support vector machine (SVM) properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that under two different indoor scenes, WiNum can achieve higher recognition accuracy for air number gestures; the average recognition accuracy of each motion reached more than 93%, in order to achieve effective recognition of air gestures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The biological activity, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance of implants depend primarily on titanium dioxide (TiO2) film on biomedical titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V). This research is aimed at getting an ideal temperature range for forming a dense titanium dioxide (TiO2) film during titanium alloy cutting. This article is based on Gibbs free energy, entropy changes, and oxygen partial pressure equations to perform thermodynamic calculations on the oxidation reaction of titanium alloys, studies the oxidation reaction history of titanium alloys, and analyzes the formation conditions of titanium dioxide. The heat oxidation experiment was carried out. The chemical composition was analyzed with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The results revealed that titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the main reaction product on the surface below 900°C. Excellent porous oxidation films can be obtained between 670°C and 750°C, which is helpful to improve the bioactivity and osseointegration of implants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cough is a protective reflex of airways and lungs. Cough may result in several complications. Postinfectious cough is a cough that begins during an acute respiratory tract infection, usually is self-limited, and is due to airway hyperresponsiveness as a result of airway inflammation. Cough radiculopathy has been once reported by Torrington and Adornato in the form of acute cervical radiculopathy. This is a case of acute lumbar radiculopathy as a result of postinfectious cough. Literature review did not show a similar case.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Liren Qian</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jian Cen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the extensive utilization of radioactive materials for medical, industrial, agricultural, military, and research purposes, medical researchers are trying to identify new methods to treat acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Radiation may cause injury to different tissues and organs, but no single drug has been proven to be effective in all circumstances. Radioprotective agents are always effective if given before irradiation, but many nuclear accidents are unpredictable. Medical countermeasures that can be beneficial to different organ and tissue injuries caused by radiation are urgently needed. Cellular therapy, especially stem cell therapy, has been a promising approach in ARS. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are the two main kinds of stem cells which show good efficacy in ARS and have attracted great attention from researchers. There are also some limitations that need to be investigated in future studies. In recent years, there are also some novel methods of stem cells that could possibly be applied on ARS, like “drug” stem cell banks obtained from clinical grade human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), MSC-derived products, and infusion of HSCs without preconditioning treatment, which make us confident in the future treatment of ARS. This review focuses on major scientific and clinical advances of hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stromal cells on ARS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. The health care industry is undergoing a rapid transformation to meet the ever-increasing needs and demands of its patient population. Level of patients’ satisfaction is an important health outcome, which is regarded as a determinant measure for quality of care. This study was performed with the aim of assessing the level of patient satisfaction with inpatient services and its determinants in Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 25th to December 20th, 2015, using 398 randomly selected patients. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Jimma University research review board, and verbal consent was also received from the study participants during data collection time. A pretested structured interview questionnaire was used to collect data from study participants. The collected data were handled by using SPSS statistical software. Before analysis, relevant explanatory variables were identified using factor analysis with varimax rotation, and bivariate analysis was carried out using linear regression for every independent variable with the outcome variable independently. Explanatory variables scoring p value &lt;−0.05 were used for the final model after checking the assumption. Study findings are presented by using tables, graphs, and description. Results. A total of 398 patients were participated in the study, yielding a response rate of 100%. A total of 46.2% (95% CI: 41.2%–51.1%) patients were satisfied by the services they received in the hospital. Patient and health care provider interaction and general facility amenity-related domains were found to explain 96.4% of the variability in the net overall satisfaction score. Good quality services provided by hospital physicians, availability of laboratory and radiology services, pain management services, and inpatient pharmacy services of the hospital had positive influences. Besides toilet cleanliness, availability of rooms for accommodation and dietary service had significant relation with level of patient satisfaction. Quality of the inpatient pharmacy service had a great influence on satisfaction; a unit increase in it resulted in 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1–2.5) times increment in patient satisfaction level at p≤0.001. For final predictors, regression estimates for level of satisfaction moved from very dissatisfied to very satisfied when service improves by a unit. Conclusion. Overall patients’ satisfaction is lower than other studies in the nation. A great opportunity is there to improve patient’s satisfaction level if the service quality is improved around the time of patient and health care provider interaction and facility amenity services. Besides, improving the health literacy of service providers and devising a strategy to routinely assess satisfaction level of patients in the facility is critical. On top of this, providing tailored on-the-job training for health care workers in the facility is a crucial step in order to improve their knowledge and skills to render patient-centered quality service to improve their patients’ satisfaction. Using a checklist during service delivery may improve client patient interaction and ensure the standard. Facility design dimension can be considered for future research activities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., a native Chinese plant species, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine formulation to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), strengthen bones and muscles, and lower blood pressure. Various parts of this plant such as the bark, leaves, and flowers have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties. E. ulmoides has potential applications as a therapeutic agent against bone disorders, which were investigated in this study. In vitro, RA joint fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were treated with different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1000 μg/mL) of E. ulmoides bark, leaf, and male flower alcoholic extracts (EB, EL, and EF, respectively) to determine their potential cytotoxicity. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α and nitric oxide (NO) levels in RA-FLS were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats were treated with EB, EL, EF, Tripterygium wilfordii polyglycoside (TG) or the normal control (Nor), and then ankle joint pathology, bone morphology, and serum and spleen inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated. The results showed that, in RA-FLS, EB, EL, and EF were not cytotoxic; EB and EF reduced TNF-α supernatant levels; and EB, EL, and EF reduced NO levels. The results of in vivo experiments showed that EB, EL, and EF alleviated ankle swelling and joint inflammation, while all extracts diminished inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus and bone destruction, and bone erosion. All tested extracts inhibited interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-17, and TNF-α mRNA in the spleen of CIA rats, while EB most effectively reduced osteoclasts and inhibited bone erosion. EF showed the most obvious inhibition of inflammatory factors and pannus. Thus, EB, EL, and EF may alleviate bone destruction by inhibiting inflammation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present research work is devoted to investigate fractional order Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (FBBM) as well as modified fractional order FBBM (FMBBM) equations under nonlocal and nonsingular derivative of Caputo-Fabrizio (CF). In this regards, some qualitative results including the existence of at least one solution are established via using some fixed point results of Krasnoselskii and Banach. Further on using an iterative method, some semianalytical results are also studied. The concerned tool is formed when the Adomian decomposition method is coupled with some integral transform like Laplace. Graphical presentations are given for various fractional orders. Also, the concerned method is also compared with some variational-type perturbation method to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When a disruption caused by human or environmental accident occurs in production systems, it may cause a shortage of the supply, and thus the buyers’ procurement behaviors will be influenced. This paper studies a supply chain comprised of a buyer and two types of suppliers: one is cheap but unreliable and the other is reliable but expensive. If there is a major disruption, the unreliable supplier may not be able to fully satisfy the buyer’s order, despite the fact that it exerts additional effort to rebuild capacity; at the same time, the reliable supplier cannot fulfill extra orders from the buyer due to capacity constraints. In this way, the buyer should strategically allocate its order between the two types of suppliers by offering different contracts at the very beginning, and then the unreliable supplier chooses its optimal restoration effort according to the contract if a disruption occurs. The model is built based on the real-life cases such as Walmart and Apple such that it is the buyer who determines the wholesale price of the unreliable supplier’s products. The results show the optimal contracts provided by the buyer under different circumstances, which aims to help managers design their contracts under disruption risks to maximize the company’s profit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. Endogenously produced antiganglioside antibodies could affect the evolution of cutaneous melanoma. Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggest “chronic inflammation” to be one of the hallmarks in skin cancers. The aim of the study was to characterize the relation between antiganglioside antibodies and inflammation in cutaneous melanoma focusing on gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b. Material and Method. We performed an observational study that included 380 subjects subdivided into three groups: patients with metastatic melanoma (170 cases), patients with primary melanoma (160 cases), and healthy subjects (50 subjects). The assessment of antiganglioside antibodies, IgG, and IgM classes, against -GM1, -GM2, -GM3, -GD1a, -GD1b, -GT1b, -GQ1b was performed using immunoblot technique (EUROLine kit). Results. The presence of IgG and IgM antiganglioside antibodies in primary melanoma was (%), as follows: anti-GM1 (5.0 and 13.1), -GM2 (1.8 and 18.1), -GM3 (0.6 and 5.6), -GD1a (0.6 and 15.0), -GD1b (3.7 and 10.7), -GT1b (0.0 and 13.1), -GQ1b (0.0 and 5.0). In metastatic melanoma, the level of antiganglioside antibodies was significantly lower compared with primary melanoma (p&lt;0.05), while in the control group they were absent. Antiganglioside antibodies anti-GM1 and -GD1a were positively correlated, while anti-GM3, -GD1b, and -GT1b were negatively associated with the inflammatory markers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and C reactive protein (CRP). Conclusions. Tumour ganglioside antigens generate an immune response in patients with primary melanomas. The host’s ability to elaborate an early antiganglioside response could be considered as a defence mechanism, directed toward eliminating a danger signal from the tumour microenvironment. Antiganglioside antibodies associated with inflammation markers could be used as diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment tools in patients with cutaneous melanoma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Culvert is an important part of roads whose healthy operation is related to the efficiency and safety of road transportation. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the safety of culvert structure by load test. Four types of prefabricated reinforced concrete box culverts (integral BC, round hinged BC, flat seam BC, and mortise BC) were designed in this paper. By designing a scale model test, the sensor system was used to test the mechanical properties of BC, which included dial indicators, strain gauges, and a pressure sensor. The finite element analysis based on material nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity of round hinged BC and integral BC was carried out. After validating the finite element models, mechanical properties of reinforcement and concrete of BCs were analyzed. The experimental results show that the failure mode of BC was tensile failure of concrete at the bottom of top slab under bending action, and integral BC had the maximum carrying capacity. The contact behaviour of sliding and rotating at hinge joints caused the first principal tensile stress of concrete at the internal surface of the side wall below hinge joints.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Rim Bakhat</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Mohammed Rajaa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Clean energy has become a growing concern, and many organizations pay attention to environmental protection and energy production as well. In the last few decades, the wind turbine has become the core of clean energy production and has advanced in generating electricity from 40 kW to 5 mW. However, the new design of the wind turbine causes several potential failures which frequently lead to the inability to accomplish the operational requirements intended to meet the customers’ expectations. As a solution to this problem, the present paper proposes a novel systematic approach that combines Multicriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques and Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) tool to reveal the fatal failures and optimize the maintenance actions. To further develop the preceding framework, this work will not only rely on the three risk factors that are involved in the traditional Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) approach but also will consider the economic aspect of the system. In the proposed approach, the grey Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied in the first place to calculate the weights of the four risk factors criteria. Second, the grey Multiattribute Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) technique is applied to rank the failure modes and their criticality on the whole system. The proposed model is verified within an organization of renewable energy production in Morocco. Furthermore, the results of the comparative and the sensitivity analysis affirm that the proposed research framework is adequate for enhancing other complex systems design, especially in a developing world where funds and resources are scarce.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Climate change has become one of the major threats to global security. On the impact of climate change on national vulnerability, the researchers firstly select relevant factors and data and analyze the principal components to determine the weight of climate change on vulnerability so as to analyze the impact of climate change on national vulnerability. Secondly, based on the influencing factors, we obtain the national vulnerability score through the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, delineate the impact scope according to the score, and predict climate change by means of regression analysis and time series analysis. Finally, according to the characteristics of cities and continents, the model is revised, a PSR model and a cluster analysis model are established, and the prediction accuracy is improved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, the transient pulse test is used to study the permeability and hydromechanical coupling effect of the fractured limestone. The permeability parameters (permeability, β factor of non-Darcy flow, and acceleration coefficient) of non-Darcy flow in fractured limestone are obtained by experimental data. The experimental results show that, in the process of transient seepage test of fractured Maokou limestone, the relationship between hydraulic pressure gradient and seepage velocity does not conform to Darcy’s law but meets Forchimer relationship. The relationship between hydraulic pressure difference and time can be fitted by quartic polynomial. The larger the confining pressure is, the more obvious the non-Darcy seepage effect of fractured rock seepage is. The seepage of rock fracture under high confining pressure is a highly nonlinear time-varying seepage. The permeability coefficient of rock decreases with the increase of volume stress. Under the action of low volume stress, the relationship between permeability coefficient and stress is more sensitive, while under the action of high volume stress, the relationship between permeability coefficient and volume stress is not significant. In the process of volume stress increasing, the β factor of non-Darcy flow appears negative. Under the action of low volume stress, the acceleration coefficient and β factor of non-Darcy flow increase, while under the action of high volume stress, the acceleration coefficient and β factor of non-Darcy flow decrease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research aims to investigate the efficiency of strengthening of plain concrete (PLC) arches using UHPC. Thirteen segment arch models reinforced using normal concrete (NC, group N) or ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC, group U) were tested in this study. The failure mode, strain distribution, and calculation of bearing capacity of PLC arch bridges reinforced with UHPC arch circle were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the technology of chiseling and planting bars could provide sufficient bond strength on the interface between the UHPC reinforcement layer and NC substrate. Both groups showed one or two failure modes of the concrete crushing of the original structure and the interface failure. However, no cracks appeared in the UHPC reinforcement layer, indicating that there was still large bearing potential. The strain distribution of the whole section in group N was consistent with the plane section assumption. But, this phenomenon was not observed in group U since the strain of the reinforcement layer was ahead (R-side loading) or behind (L-side loading) that of original structures. A simplified calculation formula was used for calculating the bearing capacity of group U. It was accurate for specimens loaded on the L-side, and an enhancement coefficient of 0.15 should be considered for R-side loading specimens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Risk prediction of dynamic disasters such as rock burst, gas outburst, and water inrush is closely related to the permeability evolution of coal seam. According to the characteristics of the lower protective layer mining, the basic assumption of gas-solid coupling model of the coal was proposed in this paper. The permeability enhancement coefficient of equivalent layer spacing was first put forward. Based on the three-zone-shaped dynamic evolution of the permeability of the overlying protective layer during the lower protective layer mining, the theories of seepage mechanics and damage mechanics were applied to introduce the permeability enhancement coefficient of equivalent layer spacing. A mathematical model of permeability evolution of the protected coal seam in the lower protective layer mining was established. Based on the engineering background of the lower protective layer mining in Changping Coal Mine, the numerical simulation using the proposed mathematical model was performed. The results showed that the stress and permeability of the protected layer in #3 coal seam evolved dynamically with the advancement of the working face of the protective layer in #8 coal seam. When the working face of the protective layer in #8 coal seam advanced to 80 m, the stress reduction rate in the relief area tended to be stable, and the stress in the stress reduction area was about 50% of the original rock stress. When advanced to 80 m, the permeability of the protected layer of the #3 coal seam increased sharply, and the permeability increased by 873 times. With the continuous advancement, the permeability of the protected layer in #3 coal seam tended to increase steadily, and the permeability increased by 1100–1200 times. The calculated magnitude of permeability increment is consistent with that in the engineering practice, indicating that the permeability evolution model is basically reasonable. The research provides a theoretical guidance for the gas drainage field application in the lower protective layer mining for prevention of coal and gas outburst.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eosinophils play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. However, the relative importance of eosinophil activation and pathogenicity in driving the progression of disease severity of allergic rhinitis (AR) remains to be defined. We aimed to assess the relation of activated and pathogenic eosinophils with disease severity of patients with AR. Peripheral blood and nasal samples were collected from patients with mild (n=10) and moderate-severe (n=21) house dust mite AR and healthy control subjects (n=10) recruited prospectively. Expressions of activation and pathogenic markers on eosinophils in the blood and nose were analyzed by flow cytometry. The eosinophilic cation protein- (ECP-) releasing potential and the pro-Th2 function of blood eosinophils were compared between the mild and moderate-severe patients and healthy controls. Our results showed that the numbers of activated (CD44+ and CD69+) and pathogenic (CD101+CD274+) eosinophils in the blood and nose as well as blood eosinophil progenitors were increased in moderate-severe AR compared with the mild patients and healthy controls. In addition, the levels of activated and pathogenic eosinophils in the blood were positively correlated with the total nasal symptom score and serum ECP and eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) levels in patients with AR. Furthermore, the blood eosinophils obtained from the moderate-severe patients exhibited a higher potential of releasing ECP and EPX induced by CCL11 and of promoting Th2 responses than those from the mild patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, patients with moderate-severe AR are characterized by elevated levels of activated and pathogenic eosinophils, which are associated with higher production of ECP, EPX, and IL-4 in the peripheral blood.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of transcranial random noise (tRNS) and transcranial alternating current (tACS) stimulation on motor cortex excitability in healthy children and adolescents. Additionally, based on our recent results on the individual response to sham in adults, we explored this effect in the pediatric population. We included 15 children and adolescents (10–16 years) and 28 adults (20–30 years). Participants were stimulated four times with 20 Hz and 140 Hz tACS, tRNS, and sham stimulation (1 mA) for 10 minutes over the left M1HAND. Single-pulse MEPs (motor evoked potential), short-interval intracortical inhibition, and facilitation were measured by TMS before and after stimulation (baseline, 0, 30, 60 minutes). We also investigated aspects of tolerability. According to the individual MEPs response immediately after sham stimulation compared to baseline (Wilcoxon signed-rank test), subjects were regarded as responders or nonresponders to sham. We did not find a significant age effect. Regardless of age, 140 Hz tACS led to increased excitability. Incidence and intensity of side effects did not differ between age groups or type of stimulation. Analyses on responders and nonresponders to sham stimulation showed effects of 140 Hz, 20 Hz tACS, and tRNS on single-pulse MEPs only for nonresponders. In this study, children and adolescents responded to 1 mA tRNS and tACS comparably to adults regarding the modulation of motor cortex excitability. This study contributes to the findings that noninvasive brain stimulation is well tolerated in children and adolescents including tACS, which has not been studied before. Finally, our study supports a modulating role of sensitivity to sham stimulation on responsiveness to a broader stimulation and age range.</dc:description>

<dc:description>PPARs are ligand-activated transcriptional factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Among them, PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma are prone to exert an antiangiogenic effect, whereas PPAR beta/delta has an opposite effect in physiological and pathological conditions. Angiogenesis has been known as a hallmark of cancer, and our recent works also demonstrate that vascular-specific PPAR beta/delta overexpression promotes tumor angiogenesis and progression in vivo. In this review, we will mainly focus on the role of PPAR beta/delta in tumor angiogenesis linked to the tumor microenvironment to further facilitate tumor progression and metastasis. Moreover, the crosstalk between PPAR beta/delta and its downstream key signal molecules involved in tumor angiogenesis will also be discussed, and the network of interplay between them will further be established in the review.</dc:description>

<dc:description>CH3NH3PbI3-xClx has been studied experimentally and has shown promising results for photovoltaic application. To enhance its performance, this study investigated the effect of varying thickness of FTO, TiO2, and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx for a perovskite solar cell with the structure glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag studied using SCAPS-1D simulator software. The output parameters obtained from the literature for the device were 26.11 mA/cm2, 1.25 V, 69.89%, and 22.72% for Jsc, Voc, FF, and η, respectively. The optimized solar cell had a thickness of 100 nm, 50 nm, and 300 nm for FTO, TiO2, and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx layers, respectively, and the device output were 25.79 mA/cm2, 1.45 V, 78.87%, and 29.56% for Jsc, Voc, FF, and η, respectively, showing a remarkable increase in FF by 8.98% and 6.84% for solar cell efficiency. These results show the potential of fabricating an improved CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Poor balance is one of the risk factors for falls in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), which is related to the symptoms. Electroacupuncture (EA) is one of the traditional Chinese conservative methods commonly used to improve the symptoms in patients with KOA. Objective. To assess whether EA increases the dynamic balance during stair negotiation among patients with KOA. Methods. A total of 40 KOA patients were assigned to two groups randomly (true electroacupuncture vs. mock electroacupuncture). Acupoints around the knee were selected in the true electroacupuncture (TEA) group with electrical stimulation (2 Hz). In the mock electroacupuncture (MEA) group, about 2 cm next to the above acupoints, the needles were inserted superficially without electrical stimulation. All the participants received 11 sessions of stimulation treatment in three weeks. The primary outcome was margin of stability (MOS). Secondary outcomes included hip kinematics and kinetics as well as pain. Results. There was no significant difference between the two groups for self-reported pain (p=0.585). During ascent, there was no difference between groups in MOS value in both directions, which was the anterior-posterior (A/P) direction and medial-lateral (M/L) direction at initial contact and toe-off as well as the midstance in the gait cycle, and no difference for the hip kinematics and kinetics between the groups was detected (p&gt;0.05). For descent, at the toe-off event, the TEA group was more unstable as compared to the MEA group in the A/P direction (p=0.029) but not in the M/L direction, and the hip showed a larger internal rotator moment (p=0.049); at the midstance, the TEA group showed a lower abductor moment than the MEA group (p=0.003). Conclusions. Based on the assessment results from the chosen patients with KOA, the TEA did not demonstrate a significant effect in improving the dynamic balance during stair negotiation in comparison with the MEA. This finding does not support EA as a conservative treatment to improve the dynamic balance in such patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In view of the low accuracy of single signal monitoring for the wear state of vibration drilling bit, a multisignal acquisition system for the wear state of ultrasonic axial vibration drilling bit is built to collect the drilling force, vibration, and acoustic emission signals under three different wear states. The drilling force, vibration and acoustic emission signals of the bit in the drilling process are processed by using wavelet decomposition technology, and the signals are extracted from the wear state of the bit, The wavelet energy coefficient with high state correlation is used as the feature parameter to identify the bit wear state. The feature parameter is trained by the combination of noise assisted LMD method and BP neural network. The experiment of single signal and multisignal fusion monitoring bit wear state is carried out, and the neural network structure is optimized according to the error. The results show that the accuracy of monitoring bit wear with a single signal of drilling force is 83.3%, the accuracy of monitoring bit wear with a single signal of vibration is 91.6%, the accuracy of monitoring bit wear with a single signal of acoustic emission is 91.6%, and the accuracy of monitoring bit wear with multisignal fusion is 95.8%; when the number of network layer is 4, the vibration is monitored with the fusion of force signal, acoustic emission signal, and vibration signal The accuracy of the state of drilling tool is up to 100%. The structure model of neural network is optimized reasonably to improve the recognition rate of bit wear in vibration drilling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a constant frequency control strategy of a microgrid by coordinating energy router (ER) and energy storage system is proposed to solve the frequency fluctuation problem of microgrid, in which ER is the core of the energy management system. The interface converter of ER connected to the microgrid adopts the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control, which adjusts the mechanical reference power in real time according to the state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage. The energy storage system adopts constant voltage and constant frequency (V/F) control to maintain the frequency and voltage stability of microgrid. The energy storage system with fast charge and discharge responds to the power fluctuation of the microgrid. ER maintains the stability of the energy storage capacity through bidirectional power regulation. When the energy storage system fails, the frequency and voltage droop characteristics of ER controlled by VSG will play a role in maintaining the stable operation of the microgrid. By the coordinating control strategy, the maximum efficiency of intermittent distributed energy can be guaranteed, and the stability, reliability, and grid-connection friendliness of the microgrid operation can be improved. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study comprehensively analyses the robustness of urban road networks through topological indices based on the complex network theory and operational indices based on traffic assignment theory: User Equilibrium (UE), System Optimum (SO), and Price of Anarchy (POA). Analysing topological indices may pin down the most important nodes for URNs from the perspective of connectivity, while more sophisticated operational indices are helpful to examine the importance of nodes for URNs by taking into account link capacity, travel demand, and drivers’ behaviour. The previous way is calculated in a static way, which reduces the computation times and increases the efficiency for quick assessment of the robustness of URNs, while the latter is in a dynamic way, namely, calculating is based on removal of individual nodes, although this way is more likely to capture realistic meanings but consumes huge amount of time. The efforts made in this study try to find the relationship between topological and operational indices so as to assist the assessment of robustness of URNs to local disruptions. Seven realistic urban road networks such as Sioux Falls and Anaheim are used as network examples, and results show that different indices reflect robustness characteristics of urban road networks from different ways, and rank correlations between any two indices are poor although small network such as Sioux Falls have better correlations than others.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study focuses on the industrial and engineering interest quantities, such as drag force and rate of transmission of heat, for pseudo-plastic nanofluid flow. The attributes of natural convection of the pseudo-plastic nanofluid flow model over a vertical slender cylinder are explored. The pseudo-plastic flow is studied under the influence of concentration of nanoparticles, rate of heat transmission, and drag force. For the first time, the pseudo-plastic nanofluid flow model has been implemented over a vertical slender cylinder which is not yet investigated. The acquired model is based on thermophoresis and Brownian motion mechanisms. The governing equations of pseudo-plastic nanofluid in cylindrical coordinates are modelled. The developed system of nonlinear equations is tackled by boundary layer assumptions and similarity transformations. Moreover, the solution of the acquired system exhibited by using a new powerful numerical technique. A comprehensive debate on drag force and transmission of heat under the influence of various emerging parameters is illustrated in the table. Furthermore, the effects of dimensionless parameters over the velocity profile, temperature profile, and concentration of nanoparticle profile have been exhibited graphically.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When performing a search and rescue mission, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) should continuously search targets above the mission area. In order to transfer the search and rescue information quickly and efficiently, two types of UAVs, the ferrying UAVs and the searching UAVs, are used to complete the mission. Obviously, this application scenario requires an efficient path planning method for ferrying UAVs. The existing path planning methods for ferrying UAVs usually focus on shortening the path length and ignore the different initial energy of ferrying UAVs. However, the following problem does exist: if the ferrying UAV with less initial energy is assigned a longer path, meaning that the ferrying UAV with less initial energy will ferry messages for more searching UAVs. When the lower-initial-energy ferrying UAV is running out of energy, more searching UAVs will no longer deliver messages successfully. Therefore, the mismatch between the planned path length and the initial energy will eventually result in a lower global message delivery ratio. To solve this problem, we propose a new concept energy-factor for a ferrying UAV and use the variance of all ferrying UAVs’ energy-factor to measure the balance between the planned path length and the initial energy. Further, we model the energy-balanced path-planning problem for multiple ferrying UAVs, which actually is a multiobject optimization problem of minimizing the planned path length and minimizing the variance of all ferrying UAVs’ energy-factor. Based on the genetic algorithm, we design and implement an energy-balanced path planning algorithm (EMTSPA) for multiple ferrying UAVs to solve this multiobject optimization problem. Experimental results show that EMTSPA effectively increases the global message delivery ratio and decreases the global message delay.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. To study the quantification of the components in rat plasma after oral administration of Shenyanyihao oral solution. Methods. Shenyanyihao oral solution has been traditionally used for the treatments of chronic nephritis in clinics. Stachydrine, Danshensu, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, plantamajoside, aesculetin, isoquercitrin, ferulic acid, baicalin, and baicalein are regarded as the main compounds in Shenyanyihao oral solution. A sensitive, efficient, and precise UPLC-MS/MS method was established and validated for the quantification of the components in rat plasma after oral administration of Shenyanyihao oral solution. Results. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of the components were acquired based on the analysis of the plasma sample by a noncompartmental method using the WinNonlin7.0 pharmacokinetic program. Danshensu, protocatechuic acid, isoquercitrin, and ferulic acid from Shenyanyihao oral solution were quickly absorbed, and their peak concentration occurred at less than 0.5 h. The pharmacokinetic parameter of the average t1/2 from Danshensu was 3.91 h in rats, and it was the most rapid distribution and elimination among the components. In addition, the Cmax of stachydrine and baicalin were revealed as the higher plasma concentrations in rats. Conclusions. This pharmacokinetic study seems to be useful for a further clinical study of Shenyanyihao oral solution in the treatments of chronic nephritis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. Delays in skeletal maturity are related to bone mass and fracture risk in children, but the factors that determine it are unknown. We aimed to identify the association between insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and skeletal maturation before and after growth hormone (GH) treatment. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, we observed 783 short children and adolescents, 229 of whom received GH therapy. Skeletal maturation was assessed based on the difference between bone age (BA) and chronological age (CA) (noted as BA-CA). Anthropometric data and laboratory values were measured, and BA was evaluated using the Greulich and Pyle method. Results. The delayed BA group was defined as BA‐CA&lt;−2 SD (n=457), and the occurrence rate of BA delay was 58.37%. A nonlinear relationship was observed between the IGF-1 standard deviation score (IGF-1 SDS) and BA-CA before and after GH therapy. Before GH therapy, there was a significant positive association between the IGF-1 SDS and BA-CA when the IGF-1 level was greater than -2 SDS (β 0.17, 95% CI 0.08, 027; P&lt;0.001). However, we did not observe a significant relationship between the IGF-1 SDS and BA-CA when the IGF-1 level was lower than -2 SDS (β 0.07, 95% CI -0.12, 0.26; P=0.454). After GH therapy, there was a significant positive association between the IGF-1 SDS and BA-CA when the IGF-1 level was lower than 2 SDS (β 0.20, 95% CI 0.12, 028; P&lt;0.001). However, we did not observe a significant relationship between the IGF-1 SDS and BA-CA when the IGF-1 level was greater than 2 SDS (β -0.03, 95% CI -0.33, 0.27; P=0.866). Conclusion. BA is more delayed in short children and adolescents. There is a nonlinear relationship between IGF-1 and BA maturation in short children before and after GH treatment. These findings suggest that a low level of IGF-1 may contribute to BA delay in short children and adolescents.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to the diversity and complexity of power network system platforms, some traditional network traffic detection methods work well for small sample datasets. However, the network data detection of complex power metering system platforms has problems of low accuracy and high false-positive rate. In this paper, through a combination of exploration and feedback, a solution for power network traffic anomaly detection based on multilayer echo state network (ML-ESN) is proposed. This method first relies on the Pearson and Gini coefficient method to calculate the statistical distribution and correlation of network flow characteristics and then uses the ML-ESN method to classify the network attacks abnormally. Because the ML-ESN method abandons the backpropagation mechanism, the nonlinear fitting ability of the model is solved. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation test was conducted on the UNSW_NB15 network security dataset. The test results show that the average accuracy of this method is more than 97%, which is significantly better than single-layer echo state network, shallow BP neural network, and some traditional machine learning methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper proposes a new class of difference methods with intrinsic parallelism for solving the Burgers–Fisher equation. A new class of parallel difference schemes of pure alternating segment explicit-implicit (PASE-I) and pure alternating segment implicit-explicit (PASI-E) are constructed by taking simple classical explicit and implicit schemes, combined with the alternating segment technique. The existence, uniqueness, linear absolute stability, and convergence for the solutions of PASE-I and PASI-E schemes are well illustrated. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that PASE-I and PASI-E schemes are linearly absolute stable, with 2-order time accuracy and 2-order spatial accuracy. Compared with the implicit scheme and the Crank–Nicolson (C-N) scheme, the computational efficiency of the PASE-I (PASI-E) scheme is greatly improved. The PASE-I and PASI-E schemes have obvious parallel computing properties, which show that the difference methods with intrinsic parallelism in this paper are feasible to solve the Burgers–Fisher equation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>To achieve precise trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators in complex environment, the precise dynamic model, parameters identification, nonlinear characteristics, and disturbances are the factors that should be solved. Although parameters identification and adaptive estimate method were proposed for robotic control in many literature studies, the essential factors, such as coupling and friction, are rarely mentioned as it is difficult to build the precise dynamic model of the robotic manipulator. An adaptive backstepping sliding mode control is proposed to solve the precise trajectory tracking under external disturbances with complex environment, and the dynamic response characteristics of a two-link robotic manipulator are described in this paper. First, the Lagrange kinetic method is used to derive the precise dynamic model which includes the nonlinear factor with friction and coupling. Moreover, the dynamic model of two-link robotic manipulator is built. Second, the estimate function for the nonlinear part is selected, and backstepping algorithm is used for analyzing the stabilities of the sliding mode controller by using Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed controller is verified subject to the external disturbance. At last, numerical simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Land use in the Yangtze River Delta in 2000 and 2017 was classified by the visual interpretation of Landsat satellite images. Then, these images were overlain with economic and physical geographical data to analyze the urban spatial expansion pattern and its physical constraints and socioeconomic influence factors by employing a combination of transition matrix analysis, expansion intensity indices, and equal-fan analysis. The results showed that from 2000 to 2017, there was a significant increase in built-up areas in the region, with rapid expansion in the core area. The northern and southern parts of the Yangtze River Delta experienced different urban spatial expansions, with a higher scale and rate in the cities along the Yangtze River and the coast in Jiangsu Province in the north than in Zhejiang Province in the south. Cities expanded towards megacities or hubs along the Yangtze River or the coast, indicating that urban expansion is influenced by preferential policies and urban planning factors in addition to the spillover effects of neighboring cities and the adjacency to seas or large rivers. Finally, urban expansion is significantly constrained by elevation, with cities at lower elevations or in flat terrain undergoing more rapid urban expansion and development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Weld defects detection using X-ray images is an effective method of nondestructive testing. Conventionally, this work is based on qualified human experts, although it requires their personal intervention for the extraction and classification of heterogeneity. Many approaches have been done using machine learning (ML) and image processing tools to solve those tasks. Although the detection and classification have been enhanced with regard to the problems of low contrast and poor quality, their result is still unsatisfying. Unlike the previous research based on ML, this paper proposes a novel classification method based on deep learning network. In this work, an original approach based on the use of the pretrained network AlexNet architecture aims at the classification of the shortcomings of welds and the increase of the correct recognition in our dataset. Transfer learning is used as methodology with the pretrained AlexNet model. For deep learning applications, a large amount of X-ray images is required, but there are few datasets of pipeline welding defects. For this, we have enhanced our dataset focusing on two types of defects and augmented using data augmentation (random image transformations over data such as translation and reflection). Finally, a fine-tuning technique is applied to classify the welding images and is compared to the deep convolutional activation features (DCFA) and several pretrained DCNN models, namely, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, ResNet101, and GoogLeNet. The main objective of this work is to explore the capacity of AlexNet and different pretrained architecture with transfer learning for the classification of X-ray images. The accuracy achieved with our model is thoroughly presented. The experimental results obtained on the weld dataset with our proposed model are validated using GDXray database. The results obtained also in the validation test set are compared to the others offered by DCNN models, which show a best performance in less time. This can be seen as evidence of the strength of our proposed classification model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Human gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors with a poor prognosis. Cisplatin (CDDP) is a well-known first-line chemotherapeutic drug. Acquired resistance retards the clinical application of CDDP in gastric cancer. In this study, circular RNA circ_0026359 was demonstrated to be overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues/cells compared with normal gastric tissues/cells and was overexpressed in CDDP-resistant gastric cancer tissues/cells compared with CDDP-sensitive gastric cancer tissues/cells. High levels of circ_0026359 were associated with low overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates in gastric cancer patients. circ_0026359 was examined to promote CDDP resistance in gastric cancer cells. circ_0026359 directly interacted and negatively regulated miR-1200. POLD4 was a direct target of miR-1200. miR-1200/POLD4 pathway mediated the promoting role of circ_0026359 in CDDP resistance of gastric cancer. circ_0026359 could be used as a potential target for CDDP-resistant gastric cancer therapy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, a noninteger order Brucellosis model is developed by employing the Caputo–Fabrizio noninteger order operator. The approach of noninteger order calculus is quite new for such a biological phenomenon. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and stability conditions for the model via the fixed-point theory. The initial approachable approximate solutions are derived for the proposed model by applying the iterative Laplace transform technique. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted for the analytical results to visualize the effect of various parameters that govern the dynamics of infection, and the results are presented using plots.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Improving the prediction accuracy of a complex trait of interest is key to performing genomic selection (GS) for crop breeding. For the complex trait measured in multiple environments, this paper proposes a two-stage method to solve a linear model that jointly models the genetic effects and the genotype × environment interaction (G × E) effects. In the first stage, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized method was utilized to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). Then, the ordinary least squares (OLS) approach was used in the second stage to reestimate the QTL effects. As a case study, this approach was used to improve the prediction accuracies of flowering time (FT), oil content (OC), and seed yield per plant (SY) in Brassica napus (B. napus). The results showed that the G × E effects reduced the mean squared error (MSE) significantly. Numerous QTL were environment-specific and presented minor effects. On average, the two-stage method, named OLS post-LASSO, offers the highest prediction accuracies (correlations are 0.8789, 0.9045, and 0.5507 for FT, OC, and SY, respectively). It was followed by the marker × environment interaction (M × E) genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model (correlations are 0.8347, 0.8205, and 0.4005 for FT, OC, and SY, respectively), the LASSO method (correlations are 0.7583, 0.7755, and 0.2718 for FT, OC, and SY, respectively), and the stratified GBLUP model (correlations are 0.6789, 0.6361, and 0.2860 for FT, OC, and SY, respectively). The two-stage method showed an obvious improvement in the prediction accuracy, and this study will provide methods and reference to improve GS of breeding.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The stable operation of a high-speed rotating rotor-bearing system is dependent on the internal damping of its materials. In this study, the dynamic behaviours of a rotor-shaft system with internal damping composite materials under the action of a temperature field are analysed. The temperature field will increase the tangential force generated by the internal damping of the composite material. The tangential force will also increase with the rotor speed, which can destabilise the rotor-shaft system. To better understand the dynamic behaviours of the system, we introduced a finite element calculation model of a rotor-shaft system based on a 3D high-order element (Solid186) to study the turbocharger rotor-bearing system in a temperature field. The analysis was done according to the modal damping coefficient, stability limit speed, and unbalance response. The results show that accurate prediction of internal damping energy dissipation in a temperature field is crucial for accurate prediction of rotor dynamic performance. This is an important step to understand dynamic rotor stress and rotor dynamic design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Urinary kidney injury molecule 1 (uKIM-1) is a proximal tubular injury biomarker for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI); its prognostic value varies depending on the clinical and population characteristics. However, the predictive value of uKIM-1 for diagnosis of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) remains unclear. Method. Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library database, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were used to identify relevant studies from their inception to November 31, 2019. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were included. Relevant data were extracted to obtain pooled sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE), summary receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and area under the ROC (AUC or AUROC). A bivariate mixed-effects regression model was used for data analysis. Results. A total of 946 patients from 8 eligible studies were included. Across all the studies, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for uKIM-1 level to predict CI-AKI was 19 (95% CI 10–39), with SEN and SPE of 0.84 and 0.78, respectively. The AUROC for uKIM-1 in predicting CI-AKI was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90). There was a substantial heterogeneity across the studies (I2 was 37.73% for the summary sensitivity and 69.31% for the summary specificity). Conclusion. Urinary KIM-1 has a high predictive value for diagnosis of CI-AKI in patients who have undergone cardiac catheterization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The slope shape is one of the most intuitive factors affecting the seismic stability of a slope. However, current research on this subject is mainly focused on statistical analysis and seismic response law, and the influence on seismic stability evaluation of the slope is rarely discussed. Furthermore, slope shapes are often simplified for easy numerical model building. In view of this, five slope models with different slope shapes are considered, and the time-history analysis method and Newmark method are chosen to evaluate the seismic stability of these slope models under different amplitudes. The purpose of this paper is to compare the seismic stability of slopes with different slope shapes and to study the feasibility of simplifying the slope shape when evaluating the seismic stability of a slope.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To develop a method for the rapid isolation of rat RPE cells with high yield and maintain its epithelial state in modified culture system. Methods. The eyeballs were incubated with dispase. The retina was isolated with RPE attached and cut into several pieces. Following a brief incubation in growth medium, large RPE sheets can be harvested rapidly. RPE cells were divided into four groups and cultured for several weeks, that is, (1) in cell culture dishes with 10% FBS containing medium (CC dish-FBS), (2) in petri dishes with 10% FBS containing medium (Petri dish-FBS), (3) in cell culture dishes with N2 and B27 containing medium (CC dish-N2B27), and (4) in petri dishes with N2 and B27 containing medium (Petri dish-N2B27). Morphological and biological characteristics were investigated using light microscopy, Q-PCR, and western blot. Results. The retina would curl inwardly during the growth medium incubation period, releasing RPE sheets in the medium. Compared with low density group (5,000 cells/cm2), RPE cells plated at high density (15,000 cells/cm2) can maintain RPE morphology for a more extended period. Meanwhile, plating RPE cells at low density significantly reduced the expression of RPE cell type-specific genes (RPE65, CRALBP, and bestrophin) and increased the expression of EMT-related genes (N-cadherin, fibronectin, and α-SMA), in comparison with the samples from the high density group. The petri dish culture condition reduced cell adhesion and thus inhibited RPE cell proliferation. As compared with other culture conditions, RPE cells in the petri dish-N2B27 condition could maintain RPE phenotype with increased expression of RPE-specific genes and decreased expression of EMT-related genes. The AKT/mTOR pathway was also decreased in petri dish-N2B27 condition. Conclusion. The current study provided an alternative method for easy isolation of RPE cells with high yield and maintenance of its epithelial morphology in the petri dish-N2B27 condition.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ming Ji</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Yi-Dong Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The research on the rheological mechanical behaviour of swelling rock in the condition of humidity field has a significant meaning for large rock engineering, such as deep coal mining, tunnelling, and slope engineering. Based on the Nishihara model, considering on the effect of humidity factor on swelling rock, the rheological elements are established and the effects of humidity on the damage of rock, the viscosity, and the elasticity are introduced. Moreover, the viscoelastic plasticity constitutive equations are established under the coupling of swelling rock stress and humidity. Afterward, considering the effects of humidity on the damage, elasticity, and viscosity, the creeping, unloading, and relaxation equations have been deduced. From this research, under the state of low stress σ3P&lt;σS, the Nishihara model which considers the effect of humidity shows the properties of stable creeping. In addition, the unloading curves contain instantaneous elasticity, elastic after effect, and the viscosity flow induced by the humidity. However, under the state of high stress σ3P≥σS, it is an unstable creeping model. The unloading curves include instantaneous elasticity, elastic after effect, and the viscosity flow induced by the stress and the humidity. This model reflects the rheological properties of swelling rock comprehensively, and it can be used for rock rheological analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the construction of the tunnel in soft stratum, it is often found that the unsupported span is too large, resulting in instability of the tunnel face and collapse of the vault. However, the unsupported span was often selected according to the experience of engineers in the actual construction process, which was lack of the theoretical basis. Therefore, based on the calculation model of the surrounding rock pressure of shallow buried tunnel, this paper analyzed the stability of the tunnel face and the vault and then obtained the calculation formula of the unsupported span of the shallow buried tunnel in soft rock stratum. It was pointed out that the unsupported span is not determined by the arch crown stability or the tunnel face stability alone, but by both. The rationality of the formula was verified by a centrifugal test and an engineering case. The analysis and discussion showed that the unsupported span is sensitive to the cohesion and internal friction angle of the rock-soil mass, especially the cohesion. The unsupported span of the shallow buried tunnel in the soft rock stratum is a linear function of the support pressure. The support pressure has a more significant contribution to the increase of the unsupported span by the centre cross diaphragm (CRD) method, and the unsupported span increases linearly with the increase of the support pressure. The research results provide a theoretical reference for the determination of the unsupported span for the shallow tunnel in the soft stratum.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to improve the accuracy of short-term travel time prediction in an urban road network, a hybrid model for spatio-temporal feature extraction and prediction of urban road network travel time is proposed in this research, which combines empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and complex networks (CN) with an XGBoost prediction model. Due to the highly nonlinear and dynamic nature of travel time series, it is necessary to consider time dependence and the spatial reliance of travel time series for predicting the travel time of road networks. The dynamic feature of the travel time series can be revealed by the EDM method, a nonlinear approach based on Chaos theory. Further, the spatial characteristic of urban traffic topology can be reflected from the perspective of complex networks. To fully guarantee the reasonability and validity of spatio-temporal features, which are dug by empirical dynamic modeling and complex networks (EDMCN), for urban traffic travel time prediction, an XGBoost prediction model is established for those characteristics. Through the in-depth exploration of the travel time and topology of a particular road network in Guiyang, the EDMCN-XGBoost prediction model’s performance is verified. The results show that, compared with the single XGBoost, autoregressive moving average, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and other models, the proposed EDMCN-XGBoost prediction model presents a better performance in forecasting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The global COVID-19 outbreak has demanded drastic actions and policies from the governments and local authorities to stem the spread of the virus. Most of the measures involve behavioural changes from citizens to reduce their social contact to a minimum. Thus, these actions influence individual activity patterns and transport systems in different ways. This paper studies the short-term impacts on the transport system caused by the different policies adopted by the Colombian government and local authorities to contain the COVID-19 spread. Using official and secondary data concerning the seven most populated cities in Colombia, we analyse the impacts on three components of the transport system: air transport, freight transport, and urban transport. Results show that national policies and local decisions have decreased the demand for motorised trips across the cities, diminishing congestion levels, reducing transit ridership, and creating a reduction in transport externalities. The country banned air transport for passengers and only allowed air cargo for medical and necessary supplies, which will have negative consequences for the economics of the airline industry. During the first three months of the COVID-19, freight was the most resilient transport component. However, freight trips diminished around 38%, affecting mainly the supply chain of nonessential products. During the pandemic, governments need to provide subsidies to maintain the system supply to avoid crowdedness and promote active transport by allocating less-used street space to cyclists and pedestrians. In the short term, transportation service providers will face a financial crisis, deepened by the pandemic, which will require government assistance for their recovery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to quantify the probability of committing a speed infraction by young drivers and to investigate to what extent listening music could affect young drivers’ emotions as well as their driving performances at the wheel. To achieve this aim, employing Bayesian networks, the study analysed different music styles, in which they resulted in sample drivers’ speed infractions. Gender and drivers’ experiences at the wheel were the other factors, which were taken into account when interpreting the study results. Variables taken into account in this study included type of music whilst driving, gender of drivers, and drivers’ driving experiences. These variables further incorporated into the study of other telemetric variables including acceleration, number of revolutions per minute (RPM) of the engine, brake, traffic, and other types of infractions other than speed, which were considered as dependent variables. A driving simulator was used, and different driving simulation studies were carried out with young people aged between 20 and 28 years. Each participant carried out three simulations by listening to different type of music in each journey. The study defined a conceptual model in which the data were analysed and evaluated mathematically through Bayesian networks. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of music on driving speed. Based on the different variables, the study further analysed the probability of speed infractions committed by drivers and their adequate speed. The range of frequency probabilities varied between 96.32% (which corresponds to experienced male drivers who do not listen to music) and 79.38% (which corresponds to less-experienced female drivers who listen to music), which resulted in their happiness or aggression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study aimed to explore the role of the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) in the assessment of pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) through analyzing the characteristics of internal function connectivity (FC) and to investigate the relationship of FC with Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) scale scores in untreated GAD patients during a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI and HAMA scale scoring were performed in 51 GAD patients (31 GAD patients with liver stagnation transforming into fire type and 20 GAD patients with stagnation of liver-Qi syndrome type) and 20 healthy controls. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the association between HAMA scores and abnormal brain FC. Compared with healthy controls, the FC of the right medial prefrontal gyrus of the DMN and the right superior temporal gyrus of the SN increased significantly in the GAD patients (P&lt;0.001). However, the FC of the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus of the SN reduced significantly in the GAD patients with stagnation of liver-Qi syndrome type as compared with healthy controls and GAD patients with liver stagnation transforming into fire type (P&lt;0.001). There was no relationship between abnormal brain FC and HAMA scores. In conclusion, the FC of the DMN and SN may be abnormal in the GAD patients at the resting state. The aberrant FC of some crucial brain regions of these networks may contribute to the pathophysiology of GAD.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Derek Hungness</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Raj Bridgelall</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The adoption of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is in its infancy. Therefore, very little is known about their potential impacts on traffic. Meanwhile, researchers and market analysts predict a wide range of possibilities about their potential benefits and the timing of their deployments. Planners traditionally use various types of travel demand models to forecast future traffic conditions. However, such models do not yet integrate any expected impacts from CAV deployments. Consequently, many long-range transportation plans do not yet account for their eventual deployment. To address some of these uncertainties, this work modified an existing model for Madison, Wisconsin. To compare outcomes, the authors used identical parameter changes and simulation scenarios for a model of Gainesville, Florida. Both models show that with increasing levels of CAV deployment, both the vehicle miles traveled and the average congestion speed will increase. However, there are some important exceptions due to differences in the road network layout, geospatial features, sociodemographic factors, land-use, and access to transit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. High blood pressure (HBP) is a proven risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. So, determining the extent of the contribution of the factors associated with HBP seems to be necessary. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate how much the prevalence of HBP attributed to obesity and high blood glucose (HBG). Methods. Data were collected from 7612 participants extracted from a screening program in 2018, in Iran, which was conducted on the subjects with the age of 30 years old and older to investigate the prevalence of HBP and their associated risk factors. To collect data, we used a standard checklist in terms of the WHO STEPS manual, and a stratified multistage sampling method was also applied. The adjusted population attributable risk of overweight, obesity, and HBG for HBP was calculated by the logistic regression model using the aflogit module. Results. Among the studied people, 7.4% of male and 10.8% of female subjects were hypertensive. The adjusted analysis showed that, in men, 27% and 41% and, among women, 19% and 37% of HBP prevalence rates were attributable to obesity (BMI ≥ 30) and fast blood sugar (FBS) (≥126), respectively. In people with both obesity and HBG, 59% of the prevalence rate of HBP in men and 46% of the prevalence in women were due to the abovementioned risk factors altogether. The results show that, if obesity and HBG were eliminated, the prevalence of HBP could be theoretically decreased from 7.4% to 5.4% and 4.3% in male subjects and from 10.8% to 8.7% and 6.8% in female subjects, respectively. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that how much the prevalence of HBP attributes to obesity and HBG in middle-age and older population. It seems that the prevention programs should be administered in the general population, and excess body weight prevention programs should also be implemented in childhood.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The stability of the financial system plays a crucial role in the sustainable economic development. Hence, to identify systemically important banks and firms, we take lending relationships with different loan terms and common asset relationships with different investment cycles into consideration to present a multilayer DebtRank model of the bank-firm system. In the light of simulation research, we can obtain the following results. First, the bank-firm system constructed displays a significant core-periphery structure, which exists in the actual financial system. Then, only very few banks and firms show systemically important characteristics, where “important” subjects hold very high net assets and profits, while &quot;fragile&quot; subjects possess negative net assets and serious losses. Furthermore, the bank-firm multilayer DebtRank model presents a great stability to a certain extent. Overall, the multilayer DebtRank model constructed in this paper has certain theoretical reference value for the supervisory authorities to extract the internal characteristics of systemically important banks and firms and identify them effectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Moringa stenopetala has nutritional and medicinal values, which is widely used by the local communities. The study aimed to evaluate the antihyperglycemic, vasodilator, and diuretic activities of the microencapsulated bioactive product from M. stenopetala leaves extract. Microencapsulation of the extract was done by spray drying technique using maltodextrin and pectin as coating materials with the core: coating ratio of 1 : 6. Then, the antihyperglycemic, diuretic, and vasodilator activities were evaluated after the product was administered to experimental animals at different doses and compared with the control groups. There were no observed physical, behavioral, and physiological changes on the mice during the acute toxicity test. The results also indicated no toxicity signs and death occurrence in the experimental animals up to 5000 mg/kg administered dose. Therefore, microencapsulated M. stenopetala leaves extract does not produce adverse effects in experimental mice. The study also showed that the microencapsulated bioactive product exhibited significant antihyperglycemic, vasodilator, and diuretic activities as the doses increase. Therefore, the study showed that microencapsulated bioactive product has significant medicinal values. Further detailed studies are recommended on chronic toxicity tests and to understand the possible mechanism of actions on the antihyperglycemic, vasodilator, and diuretic activities of the microencapsulated product.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) may result in significant blood loss and an increase in blood transfusion. Though tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely studied for the hemostasis of arthroplasty, there is little information on the use of TXA for TLIF surgery. Methods. This prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to study the influence of TXA (intravenous bolus of 10 mg/kg 15 minutes before skin incision followed by intravenous infusion of 6-8 mg/kg/h up to a total dose of 15 mg/kg during the surgery) on the blood loss and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) after TLIF surgery. 40 patients were randomized into two groups: TXA group (tranexamic acid) and control group (placebo). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the TXA group and the control group before the surgery. Outcomes assessed included blood loss, total postoperative drainage, time for drainage removal, time to ambulation, hospital stay after surgery, postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) one day after surgery, and adverse events. Results. Compared to patients in the control group after TLIF surgery, patients in the TXA group have significantly reduced intraoperative hemorrhage and time to ambulation after surgery but show similar hospital stay, postoperative drainage, time for drainage removal, postoperative Hb one day after surgery, and adverse events. Conclusions. TXA shows important ability in controlling blood loss and promoting the ERAS after TLIF surgery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Choosing an appropriate treatment for chronic pain remains problematic, and despite the available medication for its treatment, still, many patients complain about pain and appeal to the use of cannabis derivatives for pain control. However, few data have been provided to clinicians about the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions of cannabinoids with other concomitant administered medications. Therefore, the aim of this brief review is to assess the interactions between cannabinoids and pain medication through drug transporters (ATP-binding cassette superfamily members) and/or metabolizing enzymes (cytochromes P450 and glucuronyl transferases).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the only serological method approved for blood screening in China. Automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) had been used in clinical laboratories but not applied to screen HIV among blood donors. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ELISA, CLIA, and ECLIA, focusing on the feasibility of CLIA/ECLIA for blood screening. Method. 1029 blood donations from 14 blood centers screened by ELISA were enrolled in the study. All plasma samples were tested by eight ELISA assays in 16 blood centers, followed by the detection of CLIA and ECLIA methods in the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL), further confirmed by nucleic acid testing (NAT) and Western blot (WB). Results. Of 1029 samples, 136 were confirmed as HIV positive. CLIA and ECLIA assay had similar sensitivities with ELISAs but showed higher specificity (CLIA: 99.1%, 885/893; ECLIA: 99.0%, 884/893), concordance rate (CLIA: 99.2%, 1021/1029; ECLIA: 99.1%, 1020/1029), and positive predictive value (PPV) (CLIA: 94.4%, 136/144; ECLIA: 93.8%, 136/145) than most of ELISA kits (&gt;5 ELISAs) (P&lt;0.05). Kappa values of CLIA (0.967) and ECLIA (0.963) were the highest among all the serologic assays. Among 451 samples with initial ELISA reactivity, 315 were negatives, of which 307 (97.5%) and 306 (97.1%) were detected as nonreactive by CLIA (8 nonspecific reactions) and ECLIA (9 nonspecific reactions), respectively. Conclusion. Compared with ELISA, CLIA and ECLIA are more specific and accurate in detecting HIV antibody/antigen and can keep more nonspecifically reactive donors detected by ELISA. CLIA and ECLIA can be used for the improvement of serological blood screening strategy to avoid the unnecessary loss of blood donors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by clonal expansion of a CD3+/CD57+ subpopulation, which are typically CD8+ positive cytotoxic T- cells, and can only be diagnosed if there is a persistent, greater than 6 months, elevation of LGL in the blood (usually 2–20 × 109/L), in the absence of an identifiable cause. T-LGLL has been associated with reactive conditions such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections and has also been reported in association with hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies. We report a case of asymptomatic CD4/CD8 double-positive T-LGLL. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood revealed a subpopulation of CD4/CD8 double-positive T cells expressing CD57 and cTIA. Clonality was established by flow cytometric analysis of T-cell receptor V(â) region repertoire which showed that &gt;70% of the cells failed to express any of the tested V(â) regions. Clonality was further confirmed by PCR with the detection of clonal TCR beta and TCR gamma gene rearrangements. Six months later, she presented with persistent lower back pain and diagnosed with IgG kappa multiple myeloma. CD4/CD8 double-positive T-large granular leukemia is the first case reported in the literature. This rare phenotype is either underreported or a truly rare clinical entity. More studies are warranted to characterize the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of this group of patients and to further assess the relationship between multiple myeloma and T-LGLL as a cause-and-effect relationship or simply related to the time at which diagnosis has been made.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Intestinal obstruction, a life-threatening problem, often occurs in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the cause of obstruction is still unknown. Very few prediction models for intestinal obstruction in CRC exist, and their results are unreliable. Therefore, we investigated whether preoperative serum tumour markers (STMs) combined with haematological and biochemical markers could be used as predictors. We retrospectively analysed 1474 patients with CRC who underwent radical resection after admission. Several clinical features, STMs, and serum biochemical and haematological indicators were analysed. Predictors of intestinal obstruction were analysed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The accuracy of the multivariate predictors of obstruction was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create survival curves. Obstruction was found more in males (62.18%), never-smokers (73.95%), the left colon (54.20%), the tumour diameter&gt;4.5 cm (55.88%), high differentiation (89.50%), and negative nerve invasion (70.17%). The serum tumour markers (STMs) and peripheral blood routine indexes (PBRI) were significantly associated with obstructive status (p&lt;0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, total protein, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were predictors of intestinal obstruction (p&lt;0.05). The AUC for the curve with all the eight factors was 0.715 (95% confidence interval: 0.673-0.758). The STMs and PBRI were related to the obstruction status of the patients, and they could be used in combination with other clinical factors to significantly improve diagnosis and management of intestinal obstruction in CRC patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coal fines migration and intrusion in coal fractures affect coalbed methane (CBM) wells performance by reducing reservoir permeability and production continuity. Physical simulations are conducted to investigate the permeability variation under different diameter coal fines intrusion at various flow velocities and confining pressures. The results show that the conductivity of fractures is dramatically reduced and hardly recover to its initial condition after coal fines intrusion. The permeability after coal fines intrusion (Pcfi) has no direct correlation with the increase of flooding velocity, while decreases with the increase of confining pressures. The fractures can be totally blocked by coal fines, while penetration also happened during the flooding process, causing permeability fluctuation. The permeability loss rates value for 80-120 mesh coal fines intrusion are generally &lt;60% compared with the initial permeability, including the flow velocity of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mL/min with confining pressure of 6 MPa and the confining pressure of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 MPa with flow velocity of 3 mL/min. However, under 120+ mesh coal fines condition, the permeability loss rates are higher than 85% under most flow velocities and confining pressures. When coal fines become smaller, the permeability loss rates decrease to be lower than 45%, and part the coal fines are discharged with the water flow. Thus, coal fines proper dischargement can partly maintain the reservoir permeability during coalbed methane production. The results would be useful in understanding coal fines intrusion behaviors and its controlling strategies during CBM drainage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Clinical data suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) effectively decreases disease activity and maintains remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the modulatory effects of EN on the intestinal mucosal immune system remain unclear. Aims. This study first aimed at comparing the therapeutic effects of three EN formulas on ameliorating dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced chronic colitis; with the most effective formula, we then examined its influence on the mucosal inflammatory response and epithelial barrier function. Methods. The effect of EN formulas on colitis in mice was assessed by body weight, disease activity index scores, colon length, and H&amp;E staining for pathological examination. Colonic and circulating cytokine expression levels and the frequencies of immune cells were also analyzed. Intestinal epithelial barrier function was evaluated by detecting tight junction proteins. Results. We found that among the three EN formulas, an elemental diet (ED) containing enriched amino acids restored the colitis-related reduction in body weight better than the other two EN formulas. ED amino acids suppressed the release of colonic proinflammatory mediators and maintained the expression of tight junction proteins in these mice. ED amino acid treatment mitigated the colitis-induced increase in CD103+CD11b+ dendritic cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and inhibited the predominant Th1/Th17 responses particularly in the colonic mucosal lamina propria of mice with colitis. Conclusions. We showed that ED amino acids can be an effective immunomodulatory agent to reduce colitis-related inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory mediators and Th1/Th17 cell responses and by repairing the disrupted epithelial barrier.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Emergence of drug resistance and lack of therapeutic efficacy of modern antimalarial drugs are the most triggering factors for the searching of new lead compounds with different mechanisms of action. Medicinal plants with documented traditional uses are a viable option for treatment of malaria. Traditionally, the leaf latex of Aloe weloensis has been used in the treatment of malaria in Ethiopia. Hence, this study was undertaken to investigate the antimalarial activity of the leaf latex of Aloe weloensis in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. Methods. A four-day suppressive test was employed to evaluate the antimalarial effect of the leaf latex of the plant against P. berghei in Swiss albino mice. Mice were randomly assigned in five groups of five animals in each and given 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of the leaf latex, chloroquine 25 mg/kg, and distilled water. The level of parasitemia, packed cell volume, survival time, temperature, and body weight was used to determine the antimalarial activity. Results. The acute toxicity study indicated that the leaf latex of A. weloensis caused neither mortality nor signs and symptoms of toxicity at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. Furthermore, the 4-day suppressive test indicated that the latex of the plant exhibited a significant parasitemia reduction in a dose-dependent manner as compared to negative control. The leaf latex of the plant exhibited a percent inhibition of 13.05%, 41.87%, and 66.84% at doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg, respectively. The chemosuppression of the antimalarial activity was statistically significant at 100 mg/kg (p&lt;0.05), 200 mg/kg (p&lt;0.01), and 400 mg/kg (p&lt;0.01) as compared to negative control. All doses of the leaf latex prevented weight loss and reduction in temperature and packed cell volume and increased the survival time of infected mice. Conclusion. The results of this study demonstrated that the leaf latex of Aloe weloensis possessed antiplasmodial activity confirming the genuine traditional use of the plant as an antimalarial agent.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Using a base editor to generate monogenic disease models and correct pathogenic point mutations is a breakthrough technology for exploration and treatment of human diseases. As a burgeoning approach for genomic modification, the fused CRISPR/Cas9 with various deaminase separately has significantly increased the efficiency of producing a precise point mutation with minimal insertions or deletions (indels). Along with the flexibility and efficiency, a base editor has been widely used in many fields. This review discusses the recent development of a base editor, including evolution and advance, and highlights the applications and challenges in the field of gene therapy. Depending on rapid improvement and optimization of gene editing technology, the prospect of base editor is immeasurable.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The organization of the mouse spinal dorsal horn has been delineated in 2D for the six Rexed laminae in our publication Atlas of the Spinal Cord: Mouse, Rat, Rhesus, Marmoset, and Human. In the present study, the tissue clearing technique CLARITY was used to observe the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the mouse spinal cord in 3D, using a variety of immunohistochemical markers. We confirm prior observations regarding the location of glycine and serotonin immunoreactivities. Novel observations include the demonstration of numerous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) perikarya, as well as CGRP fibers and terminals in all laminae of the dorsal horn. We also observed sparse choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity in small perikarya and fibers and terminals in all dorsal horn laminae, while gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) immunoreactivities were found only in small perikarya and fibers. Finally, numerous serotonergic fibers were observed in all laminae of the dorsal horn. In conclusion, CLARITY confirmed the 2D immunohistochemical properties of the spinal cord. Furthermore, we observed novel anatomical characteristics of the spinal cord and demonstrated that CLARITY can be used on spinal cord tissue to examine many proteins of interest.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the context of increasing syphilis incidence in many Western countries, we sought to better understand the frequency and outcomes associated with inconclusive serologic syphilis results. To accomplish this, we reviewed all inconclusive results that arose from an indeterminant confirmatory treponemal screen (specifically the Treponema pallidum particulate agglutination test), which were reported to Ottawa Public Health from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. Our case review identified that 52 persons generated such test results during the study period, of whom 44.4% were cases requiring treatment, 46.3% were persons without new risk factors or symptoms of syphilis who had been previously treated for this infection, and 9.3% were not syphilis. Overall, these untreated syphilis cases accounted for 8.6% of all new syphilis diagnoses in our local jurisdiction during the study period. These results highlight that case investigation and prompt management of inconclusive syphilis results is an appropriate public health and clinical approach and that such a strategy could contribute to efforts to reduce increasing syphilis incidence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Yunnan is a multiethnic province in southwest China, rich in Materia medica resources, and is popularly known as the kingdom of plants. Biomedicine and public health industry have been the industrial pillars of Yunnan since 2016, which is the important pharmaceutical industrial base for Dai and Yi medicine in China. This review of the Yunnan ethnic medicine industry describes some of the problems to be solved in the development of sustainable ethnomedicine in China. We investigated Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) declared as ethnomedicine on the drug instructions and identified 28 Dai patent medicines (DPMs) and 73 Yi patent medicines (YPMs) that were approved for clinical use in China. In further research, the clinical indications of these CPMs were determined, and the quality standard of medicinal materials and their usage frequencies in DPMs and YPMs were investigated. We also collected and analyzed the data on use of botanical and animal sources of medicines, the rare and endangered medicinal materials, and toxic medicines in DPMs and YPMs. The application of zootherapy in Yi traditional medicine was introduced from its abundant ancient documents and records; based on the “YaGei” theory in Dai traditional medicine, toxic medicines can be relatively safe in DPMs. However, for promoting the Yunnan traditional medicine industry, it is necessary to strengthen medical research to expand evidence-based clinical practice and balance ethnomedicine production and sustainable utilization of Materia medica resources, especially the animal sources of medicines, toxic medicines, and the protected wild resources reported in this survey. Only in this way can industrialization of ethnomedicine promote the improvement of human health.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Claudin-1 plays an important part in maintaining the mucosal structures and physiological functions. Several studies showed a relationship between claudin-1 and colorectal cancer (CRC), but its prognostic significance is inconsistent. This meta-analysis assessed the prognostic value and clinical significance of claudin-1 in CRC. Materials and Methods. We retrieved eligible studies from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases before February 10, 2020. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to assess the correlation between claudin-1 and prognosis and clinical features. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q test and I-square (I2), while publication bias was evaluated by the Begg test and Egger test. Test sequence analysis (TSA) was used to estimate whether the included studies’ number is sufficient. The stability of the results was judged by sensitivity analysis. Metaregression was utilized to explore the possible covariance which may impact on heterogeneity among studies. Results. Eight studies incorporating 1704 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the high expression of claudin-1 was associated with better overall survival (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28–0.76; P=0.002) and disease-free survival (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29–0.65; P=0.003) in CRC. In addition, we found that claudin-1 was related to the better tumor type (n=6; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49–0.73; P&lt;0.00001), negative venous invasion (n=4; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95; P=0.001), and negative lymphatic invasion (n=4; RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; P=0.0009). Conclusion. The increased claudin-1 expression in CRC is associated with better prognosis. In addition, claudin-1 was related to the better tumor type and the less venous invasion and lymphatic invasion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Intervertebral disc degeneration is related to tissue fibrosis. ADAMTS can degrade the important components of the ECM during the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, ultimately resulting in the loss of intervertebral disc function. sIL-13Rα2-Fc can inhibit fibrosis and slow down the degeneration process, but the mechanism involved remains unclear. Objective. To determine the mechanism by which sIL-13Rα2-Fc inhibits ECM degradation and reduces intervertebral disc tissue fibrosis using a transcriptomics analysis. Methods. A rat model of caudal intervertebral disc degeneration was established, and Sirius red staining was used to observe the pathological changes in the caudal intervertebral disc. Transcriptome sequencing was employed to assess the gene expression profiles of the intervertebral disc tissues in the model group and the sIL-13Rα2-Fc-treated group. Differentially expressed genes were identified and analyzed using GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to verify the expression levels of candidate genes. The levels of GAG and HA were quantitatively assessed by ELISA, and the levels of collagen I and collagen II were analyzed by western blotting. Results. Sirius red staining showed that in the model group, the annulus fibrosus was disordered, the number of breaks increased, and the type I collagen protein levels increased, whereas in the sIL-13Rα2-Fc group, the annulus fibrosus was ordered, the number of breaks decreased, and the type II collagen protein levels increased. In comparison with the model group, we identified 58 differentially expressed genes in the sIL-13Rα2-Fc group, and these were involved in 35 signaling pathways. Compared with those in the model group, the mRNA expression levels of Rnux1, Sod2, and Tnfaip6 in the IL-13Rα2-Fc group were upregulated, and the mRNA expression levels of Aldh3a1, Galnt3, Fgf1, Celsr1, and Adamts8 were downregulated; these results were verified by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. TIMP-1 (an ADAMTS inhibitor) and TIMP-1 combined with the sIL-13Rα2-Fc intervention increased the levels of GAG and HA, inhibited the expression of type I collagen, and promoted the expression of type II collagen. Conclusion. Adamts8 may participate in the degradation of ECM components such as GAG and HA and lead to an imbalance in the ECM of the intervertebral disc, resulting in intervertebral disc degeneration. sIL-13Rα2-Fc promoted anabolism of the ECM and increased the levels of ECM components by inhibiting the expression of Adamts8, thus maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the ECM and ultimately delaying intervertebral disc degeneration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Prediction of HBsAg seroclearance, defined as the loss of circulating HBsAg with or without development of antibodies for HBsAg in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), is highly difficult and challenging due to its low incidence. This study is aimed at developing and validating a nomogram for prediction of HBsAg loss in CHB patients. Methods. We analyzed a total of 1398 patients with CHB. Two-thirds of the patients were randomly assigned to the training set (n=918), and one-third were assigned to the validation set (n=480). Univariate and multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis was performed using the training set, and the nomogram was constructed. Discrimination and calibration were performed using the training set and validation set. Results. On multivariate analysis of the training set, independent factors for HBsAg loss including BMI, HBeAg status, HBsAg titer (quantitative HBsAg), and baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level were incorporated into the nomogram. The HBsAg seroclearance calibration curve showed an optimal agreement between predictions by the nomogram and actual observation. The concordance index (C-index) of nomogram was 0.913, with confirmation in the validation set where the C-index was 0.886. Conclusions. We established and validated a novel nomogram that can individually predict HBsAg seroclearance and non-seroclearance for CHB patients, which is clinically unprecedented. This practical prognostic model may help clinicians in decision-making and design of clinical studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objective. To observe the effect of moxibustion on cognitive function of aging mice, to observe the effect of moxibustion on protein and gene expression of APP metabolism pathway, and to explore the mechanism of action in moxibustion. Methods. 24 SAMP8 were randomly divided into 2 groups (12 in each group): moxibustion group and model group. 12 SAMR1 mice were used as blank controls. Mice in the moxibustion group were treated with moxibustion for 8 weeks, 10 minutes each time, 5 times a week, and for a total of 8 weeks. The model group and the blank group were treated with sham-moxibustion. Behavior tests were used to detect the learning and memory ability of each group of mice. Immunohistochemical, western blot, and RT-PCR were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression of APP and BACE1. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-29 and miR-101 were observed by RT-PCR method to explore the mechanism of moxibustion at the genetic level. Results. In this study, relative to normal mice, we found that aging mice showed behavioral changes consistent with the onset of AD. However, moxibustion interventions were able to mitigate these effects to some degree in aging mice. In addition, moxibustion was proved to regulate APP metabolism pathway at protein and gene level through molecular biology tests. Conclusion. The data suggest that the effect of moxibustion intervention on cognitive function in aging mice is related to the regulation of genes and proteins involved in APP metabolism pathway; this may be a potential target for treating Alzheimer’s disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pristine and engineered metal nanoparticles are widely applied in various fields of industry, and as consequences, they are useful as well as harmful to human health and environment. This study aimed at synthesizing the green zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnNPs) using the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum Linn and assessing its toxicity on human skin epidermal (HaCaT) and human lung epithelial (A549) cells. The synthesized green ZnNPs (gZnNPs) were characterized by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The average size of gZnNPs obtained was 62 nm with a spherical shape. The effects of gZnNPs on the viability of HaCaT and A549 cells were investigated using tetrazolium salt (MTT) for 24 h. We have seen more reduction of cell viability of A549 cells in comparison to HaCaT cells. The induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using DCFDA assay and showed a slightly high intensity of green fluorescence in A549 than HaCaT cells. The different oxidative stress biomarkers such as ROS generation and lipid peroxide were increased, and GSH was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic and necrotic effect of gZnNPs in both cells was carried out using Annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. More apoptotic and necrotic cells were found at a higher concentration of gZnNPs exposure. Also, we determined the effect of gZnNPs at the molecular level by evaluating the apoptotic and inflammatory markers, in which gZnNPs downregulated Bcl2 and upregulated Bax, caspase-3, and TNF-α in HaCaT and A549 cells. Ultimately, gZnNPs exerted toxicity and apoptosis in HaCaT and A549 cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the leading causes of end-stage kidney disease. Recently, there is no specific drug available to block the kidney damage. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a major active component of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bge and has been demonstrated to benefit the kidney functions. This study explores the potential pharmacological action of AS-IV in DN of rats. Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high-fat diet and injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. The diabetic rats were randomized and treated with vehicle or AS-IV (80 mg/kg) daily by gavage for 12 weeks as the DN or AS-IV group, respectively. The normal control rats were fed with normal chow and injected with vehicles (n=8 per group). These rats were monitored for diabetes- and kidney function-related measures. The expression profiles of gene mRNA transcripts in the kidney tissues were analyzed by RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR. The levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), IL-1β, and IL-18 in the serum samples and kidney tissues were quantified by ELISA. The levels of collagen IV (COL-4) and fibronectin (FN) expression in kidney tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results. In comparison with the DN group, AS-IV treatment significantly reduced blood glucose levels, food and water consumption, 24 h urine, renal index values, 24 h urine total proteins, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and creatinine clearance rates (CCR), accompanied by minimizing the DN-induced early kidney damages, fibrosis, and microstructural changes. Furthermore, AS-IV treatment significantly modulated the DN-altered gene transcription profiles in the kidney of rats, particularly for inflammation-related genes, including the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor signaling, which was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. AS-IV treatment significantly decreased the levels of serum and kidney AGEs, IL-1β, and IL-18 expression and fibrosis indexes in the kidney of rats. Conclusion. AS-IV treatment ameliorated the severity of DN by inhibiting inflammation-related gene expression in the kidney of rats.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The World Health Organization estimates that 7 million people die every year due to pollution exposure. Among the different pollutants to which living organism are exposed, ozone (O3) represents one of the most toxic, because its location which is the skin is one of the direct tissues exposed to the outdoor environment. Chronic exposure to outdoor stressors can alter cutaneous redox state resulting in the activation of inflammatory pathways. Recently, a new player in the inflammation mechanism was discovered: the multiprotein complex NLRP1 inflammasome, which has been shown to be also expressed in the skin. The topical application of natural compounds has been studied for the last 40 years as a possible approach to prevent and eventually cure skin conditions. Recently, the possibility to use blueberry (BB) extract to prevent pollution-induced skin toxicity has been of great interest in the cosmeceutical industry. In the present study, we analyzed the cutaneous protective effect of BB extract in several skin models (2D, 3D, and human skin explants). Specifically, we observed that in the different skin models used, BB extracts were able to enhance keratinocyte wound closure and normalize proliferation and migration responses previously altered by O3. In addition, pretreatment with BB extracts was able to prevent ozone-induced ROS production and inflammasome activation measured as NRLP1-ASC scaffold formation and also prevent the transcripts of key inflammasome players such as CASP1 and IL-18, suggesting that this approach as a possible new technology to prevent cutaneous pollution damage. Our data support the hypothesis that BB extracts can effectively reduce skin inflammation and be a possible new technology against cutaneous pollution-induced damage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The impinging pressure of a water jet is a key factor in engineering applications, and the jet shape has a great influence on this pressure. In this paper, five different nozzle shapes were designed, and impacting tests were conducted based on a self-designed experimental platform using a PVDF piezoelectric film sensor and a high-speed camera to record the impacting data. Additionally, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was also applied to study the velocity distribution. The results show that the pressure profiles of different water jet shapes impacting onto a solid surface present a consistent pattern, namely, an initial transient and enormous peak pressure and then a longer and smaller stagnation pressure. Although the stagnation pressure in this paper is not sufficiently obvious, the peak pressures of the five water jet shapes are much different from one another. Under the same inlet pressure, the peak pressure of the circular water jet is the largest, and those of the square, triangular, cross-shaped, and elliptical water jets decrease in turn. The flowing regimes captured by the high-speed camera together with the CFD simulation results indicate that the discrepancy in the peak pressure may be a combined action of the liquid velocities and jet head shapes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Active vibration control approaches have been widely applied on improving reliability of robotic systems. For linear vibratory systems, the vibration features can be altered by modifying poles and zeros. To realize the arbitrary assignment of the closed-loop system poles and zeros of a linear vibratory system, in this paper, an active PID input feedback vibration control method is proposed based on the receptance method. The establishment and verification of the proposed method are demonstrated. The assignable poles during feedback control are calculated and attached with importance to expand the application of the integral control. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed method in terms of the assignment of closed-loop poles, zeros, and both. The results indicate that the proposed method can be used to realize the active vibration control of closed-loop system and obtain the desired damping ratio, modal frequency, and dynamic response.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This article studies the effects of some basic parameters of a parallel-axis helix gear stage on wind turbine gearbox vibration in a case study: a multibody dynamic model is constructed to simulate the drive train of a faulted multistage wind turbine gearbox with serious vibrations. The significant vibration behaviour of the drive train for typical excitations is calculated, and the results according to specified geometric parameters of the gears are analysed in detail to investigate effective solutions for vibration reduction. The results indicate that the helix angle and numbers of teeth of a gear pair are the most significant factors for solving the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions and relevant mechanisms are discussed and validated by a prototype vibration test.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Most construction industries (CIs) from less-developed countries (LDC) have been overwhelmed with many construction project’s challenges. The challenges have always been leading to prolonged unimproved performance of small and medium firms (SMFs). This study aimed to develop a prioritization model of strategies for performance improvement of SMF. Business process re-engineering (BPR) is adopted to facilitate the identification of the re-engineering core process as value activities and develop a conceptual framework for the study. The study used the questionnaire and interview survey to collect data from 253 respondents sampled through purposive sampling. Respondents were obtained from twenty-eight firms obtained through a systematic approach that helped to get firms practicing BPR. Data were analyzed using SPSS 24-AMOS to create structural equation modelling. Findings have revealed twelve (12) weakness indicators, seven (7) performance measure indicators, eleven (11) construction core process strategies, and sixteen (16) organizational strategies. Strategies were clustered into the seven-cluster matrix, namely: resources, capacity building, operational, government policy, design, procurement, and construction management, having a positively significant correlation on SMF’s performance improvement. The study findings revealed that the BPR technique has globally become a useful tool for many organizations seeking to attain an improved performance since it provides a chance to re-engineer the organization process. Thus, for the firm(s) to enhance performance improvement, it is recommended for LDC’s construction firm(s) to adopt re-engineering process management techniques to identify and prioritize the construction core process and organizational strategies to attain improved performance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Adverse weather conditions have a significant impairment on the safety, mobility, and efficiency of highway networks. Dense fog is considered the most dangerous within the adverse weather conditions. As to improve the traffic flow throughput and driving safety in dense fog weather condition on highway, this paper uses a mathematical modeling method to study and control the fleet mixed with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected automatic vehicles (CAVs) in dense fog environment on highway based on distributed model predictive control algorithm (DMPC), along with considering the car-following behavior of HDVs driver based on cellular automatic (CA) model. It aims to provide a feasible solution for controlling the mixed flow of HDVs and CAVs more safely, accurately, and stably and then potentially to improve the mobility and efficiency of highway networks in adverse weather conditions, especially in dense fog environment. This paper explores the modeling framework of the fleet management for HDVs and CAVs, including the state space model of CAVs, the car-following model of HDVs, distributed model predictive control for the fleet, and the fleet stability analysis. The state space model is proposed to identify the status of the feet in the global state. The car-following model is proposed to simulate the driver behavior in the fleet in local. The DMPC-based model is proposed to optimize rolling of the fleet. Finally, this paper used the Lyapunov stability principle to analyze and prove the stability of the fleet in dense fog environment. Finally, numerical experiments were performed in MATLAB to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed fleet control model has the ability of local asymptotic stability and global nonstrict string stability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>High-speed railway (HSR) transportation poses a serious challenge to dispatchers, whose job performance plays a critical role for the safety and efficiency of the transportation system. This study examined the relationship between cognitive and mental factors and job performance among Chinese high-speed railway dispatchers and established a predictive model for the job performance of dispatchers. Cognitive abilities involved in train dispatching including working memory and multiobject tracking and potential related mental factors including depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and social support were examined. Job performances were measured by both subjective and objective indicators, i.e., the overall evaluation by supervisors and the delay time by dispatching simulator. Stepwise regression results showed that both cognitive abilities and 2 mental factors (depression and perceived stress) have strong relations with job performance, and tremendous distinction between groups of good and poor performance of HSR dispatchers is revealed. The predictive model accounted for 91% of the overall variance in objective performance indicator and has 96% distinguished accuracy of good and poor groups. These findings imply that cognitive and mental factors should be of great concern to the current practice of Chinese HSR dispatcher selection and management.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose. The present study was aimed at determining the serum levels of actinin-4 (ACTN4) in cervical cancer (CC) and investigating the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum ACTN4 in CC. Materials and Methods. We included 93 CC patients, 52 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients, and 70 healthy women. Serum ACTN4 levels were assessed using an ELISA method. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum ACTN4. The survival curves were used to display the overall survival distributions. Results. Serum ACTN4 levels in CC patients were 48.39±13.98 pg/mL which is significantly higher than those in CIN patients (32.72±9.44 pg/mL; P&lt;0.001) and those in healthy controls (30.84±8.08 pg/mL; P&lt;0.001). The ROC analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of ACTN4 was 0.852 (95%CI=0.796–0.908), with sensitivity of 76.3% and specificity of 87.7%. Serum ACTN4 levels were associated with the FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and lymphovascular space invasion of CC (all P&lt;0.05). The survival curve suggested that high serum ACTN4 levels were related to poor prognosis. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that serum ACTN4 levels may be valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CC.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hong Yang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Xiaoqing Zhou</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A double Roman dominating function on a graph G is a function f:VG⟶0,1,2,3 satisfying the conditions that every vertex u for which fu=0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v for which fv=3 or two vertices v1 and v2 for which fv1=fv2=2 and every vertex u for which fu=1 is adjacent to at least one vertex v for which fv≥2. The weight of a double Roman dominating function f is the value fV=∑u∈Vfu. The minimum weight of a double Roman dominating function on a graph G is called the double Roman domination numberγdRG of G. A graph with γdRG=3γG is called a double Roman graph. In this paper, we study properties of double Roman domination in graphs. Moreover, we find a class of double Roman graphs and give characterizations of trees with γdRT=γRT+k for k=1,2.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Microalbuminuria is the cornerstone for the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy. However, it is an inadequate marker for early diagnosis. MicroRNAs are not only new and promising markers for early diagnosis but also, but they may also play a role in the prevention of disease progression. Methods. This study included ninety patients with type 2 DM in addition to 30 control subjects. MicroRNA-451 expression in blood and plasma using real-time PCR was evaluated in addition to the classic diabetic nephropathy markers (serum creatinine, urinary albumin, and eGFR). Results. There was a significant difference between the studied groups versus control regarding serum creatinine, eGFR, urinary, and plasma microRNA-451 with p=0.0001. Patients with eGFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 showed a significantly higher plasma microRNA-451 (29.6 ± 1.6) and significantly lower urinary microRNA-451 (21 ± 0.9) in comparison to patients with eGFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and p=0.0001. eGFR showed a positive correlation with urinary microRNA-451 and negative correlation with both plasma microRNA-451 and urinary albumin. Both plasma and urinary microRNA-451 are highly sensitive and specific markers for chronicity in diabetic nephropathy patients with sensitivity of 90.9% and 95.5% and specificity of 67.6% and 95.6%, respectively. Conclusion. MicroRNA-451 is a promising early biomarker for chronic kidney disease in diabetic nephropathy with high sensitivity and specificity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Giant-cell arteritis (GCA), also referred to as temporal arteritis, is the most common primary vasculitis of the elderly involving the extracranial branches of the carotid arteries, in particular, the temporal artery. Patients usually present with temporal headaches, visual impairment, fever, and scalp tenderness. Scalp necrosis associated with GCA is a rare occurrence with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature to date. It is a therapeutic emergency requiring urgent management as it may lead to irreversible loss of vision. To increase awareness of this severe complication, we report a patient with a scalp necrosis revealing a GCA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been envisioned as a promising technology for many applications in future urban wireless communication. However, to utilize UAVs properly is challenging due to limited endurance and storage capacity as well as the continuous roam of the mobile users. To meet the diversity of urban communication services, it is essential to exploit UAVs’ potential of mobility and storage resource. Toward this end, we consider an urban cache-enabled communication network where the UAVs serve mobile users with energy and cache capacity constraints. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum achievable throughput in this system. To solve this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based joint content placement and trajectory design algorithm (DRL-JCT), whose progress can be divided into two stages: offline content placement stage and online user tracking stage. First, we present a link-based scheme to maximize the cache hit rate of all users’ file requirements under cache capacity constraint. The NP-hard problem is solved by approximation and convex optimization. Then, we leverage the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to track mobile users online with their instantaneous two-dimensional coordinate under energy constraint. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges well after a small number of iterations. Compared with several benchmark schemes, our algorithm adapts to the dynamic conditions and provides significant performance in terms of sum achievable throughput.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Hyperglycemia in pregnancy complicates up to 30% of pregnancies in Africa, and this poses a major risk to both the mother and fetus. Although recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), universal screening for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy is not routinely done in many of the hospital in low- and middle-income countries. This study sought to determine the frequency and factors associated with hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy at a general public hospital in South Western Uganda. Methods. We conducted this study at Itojo General Hospital (IGH) in Ntungamo District, South Western Uganda. The study followed a cross-sectional design that employed a systematic random sampling technique to identify potential study participants during the months of October to December 2019. Using a pretested questionnaire, data on sociodemographic and medical characteristics were collected on a sample of 307 pregnant women. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for hyperglycemia using random blood sugar and fasting blood sugar test results. Data generated were analyzed with appropriate statistical tests using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 26 (SPSS Inc., USA) at P&lt;0.05. Results. The frequency of hyperglycaemia was found to be 15.6% among the study population. Multivariate analysis revealed that the ages of 19-30 years, peasantry, and multiparity with more than 5 live children and second trimester pregnancy were independent risk factors for the observed hyperglycaemia frequency. Conclusion. Our study reports new epidemiological information about the frequency and risk factors of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy from a selected Ugandan population. Our findings suggest an introduction of hyperglycaemia screening in the routine antenatal care package for proper maternal and neonatal health outcomes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The mobile blockchain has been recognized as an emerging solution to address the security and privacy issues in a mobile application system. The mining process in mobile blockchain requires high computing resources which could overwhelm that which mobile devices can offer. In this case, mobile edge computing servers (MESs) can be involved to offer computing services to miners in mobile blockchain. Note that the resources of MESs are also limited; MESs could further request resources from the cloud computing server (CCS). Accordingly, the issue of hierarchical computing resource allocation arises. In this paper, we first consider a simple case with single-seller multiple buyers and a hierarchical single-seller multibuyer combinatorial auction model is proposed to solve this problem, based on which efficient and truthful frameworks are provided. We then extend the model to consider multiple CCSPs and propose a hierarchical multiple-seller multiple-buyer combinatorial auction model. For both models, the winner determination problems are formulated and computationally tractable algorithms are proposed. Also, pricing schemes are proposed to ensure the property of incentive compatibility and individual rationality. Finally, we evaluate the proposed schemes via simulations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Glidesheath slender (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and a sheathless Eaucath guiding catheter (Asahi Intecc, Nagoya, Japan) are two major slender devices utilized in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study aimed to investigate the differences in access-site complications between these devices in PCI for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A total of 1108 consecutive patients who underwent transradial PCI for ACS were enrolled. Transradial PCI was performed using either a 7-Fr Glidesheath slender/7-Fr guiding catheter combination (Glidesheath group) or a 7.5-Fr sheathless guiding catheter (Sheathless group); 1 : 1 propensity score matching was performed, and 728 patients (364 in each group) were included in the propensity-matched population. In the matched patients, univariate analysis revealed that the Glidesheath group had less radial artery occlusion (RAO) at 30 days (Glidesheath: 1.4% vs. Sheathless: 4.1%, odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) =  0.12–0.91, p=0.039), whereas no significant between-group differences were observed in severe radial spasm (Glidesheath: 1.4% vs. Sheathless: 1.9%, OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.23–2.22, p=0.58) or access-site major bleeding (Glidesheath: 1.4% vs. Sheathless: 1.6%, OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.26–2.71, p=1.00). Multivariate analysis revealed that the choice for Glidesheath was significantly associated with less RAO (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11–0.93, p=0.036). In conclusion, 7-Fr Glidesheath slender/7-Fr guiding catheter combination is obviously more advantageous than 7.5-Fr sheathless guiding catheters for decreased risk of RAO. The potential low risk of RAO in our findings supports the adoption of the 7-Fr Glidesheath slender sheath/7-Fr guiding catheter combination in transradial PCI for ACS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with a variety of different histopathologic subtypes in which each subtype may be further subclassified. These entities carry with them unique prognoses and necessitate treatment with specific immunotherapy agents should advanced disease be uncovered. Meanwhile, aberrant physiologic processes may lead to unique histologic findings within these subtypes, further complicating management and prognostication. Heterotopic ossification within RCC is one of these rare occurrences and was once thought to have favorable prognostic implications. We report a case of a young female with papillary type 2 RCC with heterotopic ossification.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The gradual increase in wildfires has caused frequent trips and outages along electrical transmission lines, which is a serious threat to the operational stability of power grids. A self-adaptive wildfire detection algorithm has been developed and tested in this paper. Most of existing wildfire detection methods employed fixed thresholds to identify potential wildfire pixels while the background pixels were ignored. By calculating two-dimensional histogram of the brightness temperatures of mid-infrared channel, the threshold selection is self-adaptive and potential pixels containing scenes of fire can be distinguished automatically. Based on the two-dimensional Otsu method and contextual test algorithm, an improved wildfire detection algorithm that uses multitemporal Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) data is described. The wildfire detection results within three kilometers of electrical transmission lines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has accurate low-temperature wildfire detection ability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Inadequate dietary diversity intake during pregnancy results in increased risks of negative maternal and perinatal outcomes. About one million neonates die on the first day of life due to inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy as a result of maternal complication and adverse birth outcomes. This review summarizes the burden of inadequate dietary diversity and its determinants among pregnant women at the national level of Ethiopia. Methods. Studies were retrieved from selected electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Random-effects model meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled burden of inadequate dietary diversity and its determinants at a 95% confidence interval with its respective odds ratio (OR) using statistical R-software version 3.6.1. Moreover, quality appraisal of the included studies, publication bias, and level of heterogeneity were checked with subgroup analysis and sensitivity influential test. The searches were restricted to articles published in the English language only, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) was used to help expand the search in advanced PubMed search. Result. A total of 850 articles were identified through the initial search of which 21 studies were included in the final review yielding a total sample size of 9,230 pregnant women. The pooled prevalence of inadequate dietary diversity was 53% (95% CI: 44%, 62%). Food insecurity [AOR = 2.18, (95% CI: 1.02, 4.63)], family size of greater than four [AOR = 1.46, (95% CI: 1.10, 1.95)], rural residence [AOR = 4.52, (95% CI: 1.02, 20.09)], no formal educational status [AOR = 4.50, (95% CI: 1.02, 20.09)], and a lack of counseling about dietary diversity [AOR = 2.75, (95% CI: 2.17, 3.48)] were among the significantly associated factors for inadequate dietary diversity. Conclusion. In this review, there was a high prevalence of inadequate dietary diversity among pregnant women at the national level in Ethiopia. Therefore, strengthening early counseling and diagnosis of dietary intake and undernutrition during the antenatal care period is important.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Guodong Zheng</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this paper, the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method is used for solving 3D advection-diffusion problems. The improved moving least-squares (IMLS) approximation is used to form the trial function, the penalty method is applied to introduce the essential boundary conditions, the Galerkin weak form and the difference method are used to obtain the final discretized equations, and then the formulae of the IEFG method for 3D advection-diffusion problems are presented. The error and the convergence are analyzed by numerical examples, and the numerical results show that the IEFG method not only has a higher computational speed but also can avoid singular matrix of the element-free Galerkin (EFG) method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The main objective of this paper is to develop a new mathematical model to study, analyze, and control the family status in several regions and to discuss the impact of the connectivity of regions and the mobility of residents on the marital status of the family, by adopting a multiregion discrete-time model. The modelling and the control process of the system that describes the case of monogamous marriages in a multiregion framework are considered. Two combined control strategies are proposed, which allow reducing the virgin and divorced individuals and increasing the number of married individuals in a specific region. The first control is considered as the impact of public awareness campaigns to educate virgin men and women about the benefits of marriage for the individual and the society; the second control characterizes the legal procedures, administrative complications, and the heavy financial and social consequences of divorces. The optimal control theory is applied to characterize such optimal strategies and determined numerically using a progressive-regressive discrete scheme to discuss the obtained results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is an idiopathic maculopathy characterized by thickened choroid, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, and variable subretinal fluid. CSCR predominantly affects young men, with risk factors including corticosteroid use, the type A behavior pattern, and psychological stress. While usually self-limited with a good visual prognosis, recurrent and persistent CSCR can lead to outer retinal and/or retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, choroidal neovascularization, and visual loss. This article reviews current multimodal imaging and treatment options, which include observation, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, thermal laser photocoagulation, and off-label photodynamic therapy with verteporfin.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Backscattered sound waves of seabed sediments are important information carriers in seafloor detection and acoustic characteristic parameters inversion. Most of the existing methods for estimating geoacoustic parameters are based on multiangle seabed backscattered signal processing and suitable for flat seafloor conditions with uniform sediment thickness. This usually deviates from the real field conditions and affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this paper, the sound ray propagation theory is studied and analysed under the condition of sloping seabed and uneven sediment thickness. Based on the phased parameter array sonar system, a method of acoustic parameters estimation of the sediment under inclined seabed conditions is proposed. The simulation results show that the new method shows good adaptability to different inclination angles of the seabed and solves the problem of accuracy of acoustic parameter estimation of the inclined seabed sediments. The model will greatly reduce the seafloor topography requirements in the sediment acoustic parameter inversion, such as velocity, layer thickness, and acoustic impedance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For safe and efficient operation of electric vehicles (EVs), battery management system is essential. Nevertheless, a challenge lying in battery management systems is how to obtain an algorithm for state of charge (SOC) estimation that has both high accuracy and low computational cost. For this purpose, the battery parameters and SOC joint estimation algorithm based on bias compensation least squares and alternate (BCLS-ALT) algorithm are proposed in this paper. The battery model parameters are identified online using the bias compensation least squares (BCLS), while the SOC is estimated applying the alternate (ALT) algorithm, which can switch the computational logic between H-infinity filter (HIF) and ampere-hour integral (AHI) to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the SOC estimated by the BCLS-ALT algorithm is the highest, and the computational efficiency is also high, with the switching threshold SOCALT being set to 25%. Despite the 20% initial error and the 10% current drift, the proposed BCLS-ALT algorithm can obtain high accuracy and robustness of SOC estimation under different ambient temperatures and dynamic load profiles.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The coal mill is one of the important auxiliary engines in the coal-fired power station. Its operation status is directly related to the safe and steady operation of the units. In this paper, a model-based deep learning algorithm for fault diagnosis is proposed to effectively detect the operation state of coal mills. Based on the system mechanism model of coal mills, massive fault data are obtained by analyzing and simulating the different types of faults. Then, stacked autoencoders (SAEs) are established by combining the said data with the deep learning algorithm. The SAE model is trained by the fault data, which provide it with the learning and identification capability of the characteristics of faults. According to the simulation results, the accuracy of fault diagnosis of coal mills based on SAE is high at 98.97%. Finally, the proposed SAEs can well detect the fault in coal mills and generate the warnings in advance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Poor mechanical property is a critical problem for phosphoric acid-doped high-temperature proton exchange membranes (HT-PEMs). In order to address this concern, in this work, a 3D network structural poly (aryl ether ketone)-polybenzimidazole (PAEK-cr-PBI) polymer electrolyte membrane was successfully synthesized through crosslinking reaction between poly (aryl ether ketone) with the pendant carboxyl group (PAEK-COOH) and amino-terminated polybenzimidazole (PBI-4NH2). PAEK-COOH with a poly (aryl ether ketone) backbone endows superior thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, while PBI-4NH2 serves as both a proton conductor and a crosslinker with basic imidazole groups to absorb phosphoric acid. Moreover, the composite membrane of PAEK-cr-PBI blended with linear PBI (PAEK-cr-PBI@PBI) was also prepared. Both membranes with a proper phosphoric acid (PA) uptake exhibit an excellent proton conductivity of around 50 mS cm-1 at 170°C, which is comparable to that of the well-documented PA-doped PBI membrane. Furthermore, the PA-doped PAEK-cr-PBI membrane shows superior mechanical properties of 17 MPa compared with common PA-doped PBI. Based upon these encouraging results, the as-synthesized PAEK-cr-PBI gives a highly practical promise for its application in high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs).</dc:description>

<dc:description>We analyze a queueing-inventory system which can model airline and railway reservation systems. An arriving customer to an idle server joins for service immediately with exactly one item from inventory at the moment of service completion if there are some on-hand inventory, or else he accesses to a buffer of varying size (the buffer capacity varies and equals to the number of the items in the inventory with maximum size S). When the buffer overflows, the customer joins an orbit of infinite capacity with probability p or is lost forever with probability 1−p. Arrivals form a Poisson process, and service time has phase type distribution. The time between any two successive retrials of the orbiting customer is exponentially distributed with parameter depending on the number of customers in the orbit. In addition, the items have a common life time with exponentially distributed. Cancellation of orders is possible before their expiry and intercancellation times are assumed to be exponentially distributed. The stability condition and steady-state probability vector have been studied by Neuts–Rao truncation method using the theory of Level Dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (LDQBD) processes. Several stationary performance measures are also computed. Furthermore, we provide numerical illustration of the system performance with variation in values of underlying parameters and analyze an optimization problem.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Samuel Maina</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Maize (Zea mays L.) is a significant food security crop in Kenya and it serves as the main source of nutrition and calories among the small-holder farmers. The overall maize yields per hectare have been fluctuating in the past few years posing a great risk to food security. Among the stress factors associated with maize yield loss include plant-feeding nematodes. In this regard, this study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of plant-parasitic nematodes specifically Scutellonema spp. under field conditions on maize performance in Mwea, Kenya. The field trials were laid out in a randomized complete block design with each treatment comprising of four replicates. The treatments included maize plots without nematicide (MPWN) and control plots treated with nematicide. The experiments were conducted in two trials. Soil samples were taken at a 0–20 cm depth at monthly intervals during 2018–2019. During the two trials, MPWN recorded significantly lower plant height and number of leaves per plant. Correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between Scutellonema abundance with leaf area index, plant height, and number of functional leaves in MPWN during the 2019 trial. This implies that high population of Scutellonema perhaps has the potential to affect leaf area index, plant height, number of leaves per plant, which are aspects that in turn influence maize productivity. Therefore, holistic sustainable management practices to control Scutellonema spp. in maize fields such as use of organic amendments, resistant maize cultivars, and antagonistic organisms are crucial in order to alleviate negative impacts linked to Scutellonema infestation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Introduction. In recent decades, the developing countries of Southeast Asia, including the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), have experienced a rapid growth of their urban population. Partly as a result of that, issues of undernutrition and overnutrition became a significant public health problem. Objective. To examine the prevalence of overweight and obesity and their related factors, among the school-attending adolescents in the Lao capital of Vientiane. Methods. A cross-sectional data on 300 adolescents aged 15–19 were collected during the months of March, April, and May 2018 by means of a self-administrated questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were used to obtain data on height and weight. Pearson’s chi-squared test, Fisher exact tests, and univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were applied in the course of the statistical analysis. Results. The study found a high prevalence of overweight/obesity (23.3%) and thinness (10.3%). Poor eating habits were noted in 67.0% of adolescents, even though 78.0% of them had a good knowledge of nutrition. Factors significantly associated with the overweight/obesity were low physical activities (aOR = 18.3; 95% CI: 5.51–60.66) and adolescents living with their guardians (aOR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08–0.79). Results also indicated that, in 47.3% of the cases, teachers, acting as a source of health and nutrition information, can prevent the risk of adolescents’ overweight/obesity (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.11–3.80) but not their thinness (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.17–0.88). Conclusions. Laotian adolescents are facing the spectrum of malnutrition in urban areas. To improve adolescents’ nutritional status, there is a need for a collaborative approach of public health agencies that would address the issues of an effective food and nutrition policy. The school curricula should also include programs on nutrition and physical education.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the combined effects of different amounts of graphite tailings (GT) as a substitute for sand and three cure methods on the early-age mechanical and material performances of cement mortar have been investigated. The results can be concluded that graphite tailings and hot-water cure method can effectively improve the early strength of cement-based materials and facilitate the formation of high-density calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), more Ca(OH)2 (CH), and other hydration products. Simultaneously, the pore structure distribution in the cement mortar is improved to be finer. Finally, this paper explains the mechanism of GT and hot-water curing (HWC) method on early-age performances of the cement mortar through the graphic model and provides the basis for selecting the GT and HWC method on improving early performance requirements for special engineering or rapid repair engineering through the proposed comprehensive quantitative calculation model.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research aims to introduce an intelligent controlling system of windmill-generated voltage connected to a load of 12 V. As natural wind speed lacks consistency, the resultant irregular voltage can lead to system damage. In the experiment, a buck-boost converter is not only designed to control such voltage but also tuned by intelligent methods. It is very challenging to control the system. PI controller is developed using metaheuristic optimization, an artificial fish-swarm algorithm (AFSA). In testing, the buck-boost converter is controlled by the PI controller at a reference voltage of 14 V and supplied with an input voltage Vin in the range of 5–100V. The result shows that, even with inconstant Vin, the system can effectively control the reference voltage at 14 V.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cracks in clayey soils are common during desiccation. The presence of cracks significantly alters the mechanical and hydraulic properties of soils. The objective of this article is to summarize the works on cracking behavior and mechanism in clayey soils related to desiccation. Historical field investigations, laboratory experimentations, identified mechanisms, and numerical approaches for modeling the process of cracking during desiccation are discussed. The experimental approaches for interpreting the mechanisms of cracking are systematically summarized and comprehensively reviewed based on the in situ observations and laboratory experimentations from the literature. The soil mechanics-based approaches resumed in this article according to the fracture mechanics theory and numerical results highlight the cracking development mechanism. Concerning the plasticity characteristics of clayey soils, researches on soil fracture mechanics should be paid more attention. More in situ experimentations and numerical researches are suggested for future researches to better understand the cracking behavior and mechanism in clayey soils related to desiccation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Vascular endothelial insulin signaling is critical for the maintenance of vascular and metabolic homeostasis. We have previously shown that in hypertensive Dahl rats, impaired vascular insulin action is linked to angiotensin II activation of the NFκB inflammatory pathway. Macrophage polarization (M1) has implicated in hypertensive and metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the effect of macrophage depletion using liposome-encapsulated clodronate (LEC) on endothelial insulin resistance and cardiovascular remodeling in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. High salt intake (HS) for 5 weeks increased systolic blood pressure (SBP: 192±5 vs. 144±4 mmHg in NS, p&lt;0.05), aortic and cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and impaired acetylcholine- and insulin-induced vasorelaxation, accompanied by impaired insulin activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOS)/NO signaling. HS rats had a significant increase in CD68 (a monocyte/macrophage marker) expression in the aorta and the heart. LEC reduced SBP (168±5 mmHg, p&lt;0.05) and cardiovascular injury and improved acetylcholine- and insulin-mediated vasorelaxation and insulin signaling molecules with a reduction in the macrophage infiltration in the aorta and the heart. HS rats also manifested an increase in the aortic expressions of inflammatory cytokines, including the ratio of phosphorylated inhibitory kappa B (Iκb)/Iκb, tumor necrosis factor α, and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and oxidative stress, which were reduced in HS/LEC rats. Our results suggest that in salt-sensitive hypertension, macrophage may importantly contribute to endothelial insulin resistance, vascular inflammation, and injury. These findings support the idea that macrophages may be a new target for immunotherapy of vasculopathy in hypertensive and metabolic disorders.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Maternal satisfaction is considered one of the most frequently used indicators to measure the quality and efficiency of childhood immunization service. Evaluating maternal satisfaction towards childhood immunization service is very relevant as it likely affects the clinical and revisit adherence, service quality, and its coverage. In countries like Ethiopia, where childhood immunization coverage is below average (39%) with low maternal satisfaction on the service, identifying factors associated with maternal satisfaction is very critical. Despite the acknowledgement made on the importance of maternal satisfaction for the successful provision of child immunization services, there is limited knowledge in Ethiopia on its contributing factors. Objective. The aim of this study was to assess maternal satisfaction towards childhood immunization service and its associated factors among mothers’ having children aged less than 1 year in Wadla district, North Wollo, Ethiopia, 2019. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 682 mothers from March to April 2019 in Wadla district, North Wollo, Ethiopia. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to select households of the study participants. A pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used. During the period of data collection, every questionnaire was cross-checked and the collected data were checked for completeness and consistency on a daily basis. Then, the cleaned data was coded and entered in to Epi Info software version 7.2.2.2 and exported to SPSS software version 23.0 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysies were done to identify variables having a significant association with maternal satisfaction. Variables with a p value of ≤ 0.05 and adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI were considered having a statistically significant association during multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then, the findings were presented using tables, graphs, and charts. Result. The overall proportion of maternal satisfaction towards childhood immunization service was found to be 68.2% [95%CI=64.7%−71.7%]. The finding revealed that attending secondary education [adjusted odds ratio AOR=0.26; 95%CI=0.13−0.53], being divorced [AOR=0.46; 95%CI=0.23−0.91], and having favorable attitude towards child immunization [AOR=1.58; 95%CI=1.05–2.33] were found to be significantly associated with maternal satisfaction. Furthermore, the multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that short waiting time before receiving service [AOR=1.83; 95%CI=1.21−2.79], greeting from care providers, [AOR=5.69; 95%CI=3.36−9.65], having information about the current vaccine [AOR=2.03; 95%CI=1.25−3.32], dose of vaccine [AOR=2.24; 95%CI=1.40−3.58], and next immunization schedule [AOR=3.21; 95%CI=1.70−6.04] were also significantly associated with maternal satisfaction towards childhood immunization services. Conclusion and Recommendation. Generally, the study showed that more than two-thirds of the mothers were satisfied by the immunization service rendered. The level of satisfaction was higher with respect to the health workers’ relationship, communication, and immunization system aspects. However, more efforts need to be put towards improving the service waiting time for immunization, and provision of health information and communication is also recommended to enhance the level of favorable attitude among mothers towards childhood immunization services.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates pose a severe challenge to both veterinary and health professions and dairy cattle producers. Cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2014 to May 2015 to isolate and identify S. aureus from mastitic cows’ milk and estimate the occurrence of MRSA in the dairy farms of Shire. Physical examination and California mastitis test were performed on a total of 220 dairy cows. Bacteriological isolation and identification and antibiogram testing were performed. Furthermore, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done for the detection of mec A and fem A genes. Out of the 220 dairy cows, 64 (29.09%) were positive for bovine mastitis, and of these, 32.81% were coagulase-positive S. aureus (CoPS). Antibiogram test results showed 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, nalidixic acid, and ampicillin, and 33.33% of the CoPS showed resistance to oxacillin (phenotypically MRSA positive). But 38.09% of the CoPS were found to be resistant and susceptible to vancomycin. PCR amplification of the seven phenotypically MRSA isolates revealed that 42.9% and 71.4% of them were found to carry fem A and mec A genes, respectively. The current study revealed the existence of alarming level of CoPS and development of multidrug resistance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular (CV) conditions on disease progression among patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. Methods. This study evaluated the association of underlying CV conditions with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to the designated hospital for intensive care due to COVID-19 disease progression. The patients were divided into with and without CV conditions as well as stable and intensive care groups. Results. Of the 332 patients with mild COVID-19, the median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of the 48 (14.5%) patients with CV conditions, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CV conditions, patients with CV conditions were older and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CV conditions than in patients without CV conditions (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P&lt;0.001). In subgroup analysis, the rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease (CHD) than in patients without hypertension or CHD. The multivariable regression model showed that CV condition served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (odds ratio (OR), 2.652 (95% CI, 1.019-6.899)) after adjustment for various cofounders. Conclusions. Patients with mild COVID-19 complicating CV conditions are susceptible to develop severe disease status and requirement for intensive care.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) are key players in regenerative medicine, relying principally on their differentiation/regeneration potential, immunomodulatory properties, paracrine effects, and potent homing ability with minimal if any ethical concerns. Even though multiple preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated remarkable properties for MSCs, the clinical applicability of MSC-based therapies is still questionable. Several challenges exist that critically hinder a successful clinical translation of MSC-based therapies, including but not limited to heterogeneity of their populations, variability in their quality and quantity, donor-related factors, discrepancies in protocols for isolation, in vitro expansion and premodification, and variability in methods of cell delivery, dosing, and cell homing. Alterations of MSC viability, proliferation, properties, and/or function are also affected by various drugs and chemicals. Moreover, significant safety concerns exist due to possible teratogenic/neoplastic potential and transmission of infectious diseases. Through the current review, we aim to highlight the major challenges facing MSCs’ human clinical translation and shed light on the undergoing strategies to overcome them.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Treatment of brain diseases is always limited by the physiological nature of the highly selective blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the electrostatic charge of the nanoporous extracellular matrix. Nanomedical application provides a promising drug delivery revolution for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). It depends on improving the pharmacokinetic distribution of drugs through the central nervous system. Nanotechnology offers various forms of nanoparticles, and these nanoparticles have brain-targeted and long-acting properties with minimal systemic adverse effects and motor complications. Gene delivery vehicles and nanocarriers including neurotrophic factors are promising therapeutics for many NDDs, and they can modulate neuronal survival and synaptic connectivity. Neurotrophic factors when integrated with the nanotechnological approaches can pass the BBB merely, representing a significant challenging track. Clinical trials proved that levodopa nanoparticles cause little motor complications which is a considerable drawback in treating Parkinson’s disease with levodopa. Recently, nanotechnology had patented new formulations and achieved various advanced procedures for management, and even prevention, of NDDs. Nanotechnology can be integrated into neuroscience to fight against neurodegenerative diseases. Primary research studies in using nanoparticles to cure Alzheimer disease (AD) are promising but are still in need for more investigations. The present paper aims to review, outline, and summarize various efforts done in the field of using nanoparticles in the management of Alzheimer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Land use change from natural ecosystems to managed agroecosystems is one of the main causes of soil fertility decline. Severe soil erosion caused by agricultural expansion and poor management worsened soil nutrient depletion in cultivated outfields (crop lands). This study was conducted to examine the effects of land use and land cover changes (LU/LC) on selected soil physicochemical properties in the Shenkolla watershed. A total of 40 top soil samples at 0–20 cm depth were collected from four land use/land cover types (forest land, grazing land, cultivated outfield, and cultivated homestead garden fields). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine differences in soil parameters among land use types. Treatment means comparison was determined using the least significant difference (LSD) at 0.05 level of significances. The result indicated that there were significant P&lt;0.05 differences among the four LU/LC types for soil characteristics. For most parameters evaluated, the most favorable soil properties were observed in the forest land, followed by homestead garden fields, while the least favorable soil properties were found in intensively cultivated outfields. Increase in the extent of cultivated land at the expense of forest cover associated with poor management has promoted significant loss of soil quality in intensively cultivated outfields. Reducing the land cover conversion and adopting proper management practices of the soil commonly used in homestead garden fields are very crucial in order to improve soil fertility in intensively cultivated outfields.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Somatosensory stimulation can effectively induce plasticity in the motor cortex representation of the stimulated body part. Specific interactions have been reported between different representations within the primary motor cortex. However, studies evaluating somatosensory stimulation-induced plasticity between different representations within the primary motor cortex are sparse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of somatosensory stimulation on the modulation of plasticity between different representations within the primary motor cortex. Twelve healthy volunteers received both electroacupuncture (EA) and sham EA at the TE5 acupoint (located on the forearm). Plasticity changes in different representations, including the map volume, map area, and centre of gravity (COG) were evaluated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after the intervention. EA significantly increased the map volume of the forearm and hand representations compared to those of sham EA and significantly reduced the map volume of the face representation compared to that before EA. No significant change was found in the map volume of the upper arm and leg representations after EA, and likewise, no significant changes in map area and COG were observed. These results suggest that EA functions as a form of somatosensory stimulation to effectively induce plasticity between different representations within the primary motor cortex, which may be related to the extensive horizontal intrinsic connectivity between different representations. The cortical plasticity induced by somatosensory stimulation might be purposefully used to modulate human cortical function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We explored the face classification processing mechanism in depressed patients, especially the biases of happy faces in face classification processing of depression. Thirty patients with the first episode of depression at the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University were selected as the depression group, while healthy people matched for age, gender, and educational level were assigned to the control group. The Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale were used to select the subjects; then, we used the forced face classification paradigm to collect behavioral (response time and accuracy) and event-related potential (ERP) data of the subjects. The differences between the groups were estimated using a repeated measurement analysis of variance. The total response time of classified faces in the depression group was longer than that in the control group, the correct rate was lower, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). N170 component analysis demonstrated that the latency of the depression group was prolonged, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). When classifying happy faces, the depressed patients demonstrated a decrease in N170 amplitude and a prolongation of latency in some brain regions compared with the healthy individuals. The cognitive bias in depression may be due to prolonged processing of positive facial information and difficulty in producing positive emotional responses.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Aroonkumar Beesham</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Recently, some authors have considered the quantum spectrum of black holes. This consideration is extended to tachyonic black holes in a brane-anti-brane system. In this study, black holes are constructed from two branes which are connected by a tachyonic tube. As the branes come closer to each other, they evolve and make a transition to thermal black branes. It will be shown that the spectrum of these black holes depends on the tachyonic potential and the separation distance between the branes. By decreasing the separation distance, more energy emerges and the spectrum of the black hole increases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>China’s western mining area is an arid and semiarid area with a fragile ecological environment, and the high-intensity mining activities aggravate ecological damage. Reasonable choice of the mining parameters (i.e., mining height, panel width, and advancing speed) can not only improve the mining efficiency but also weaken the mining-induced deformation and failures of the overburden and surface. The statistical analysis of the relationship between the mining parameters and periodic weighting interval (PWI) proves that mining parameters have significant influence on overburden failure. In this study, the damage constitutive equation was derived, and the overburden damage degree was defined to quantitatively characterize mining-induced stratum damage in a three-dimensional space. FLAC3D numerical models embedded with a damage constitutive equation were built to compare the panel width effect and advancing speed effect between the overburden damage degree and the water-conducted fracture zone (WCFZ). The reasonable range for mining parameters of the panel 12401 was provided based on the fitting function of the overburden damage degree versus mining parameters. The field measurements were carried out on panel 12401 of the Shangwan coal mine, including the advancing speed, PWI, and ground crack development. The results show that, under constant engineering and geological conditions, the damage degree of overburden will be weakened by increasing the advancing speed, reducing the mining height, or shortening the panel width. The overburden damage degree is more accurate than the height of the water-conducted fractured zone. The reasonable mining parameters of the panel 12401 are 8.8 m in mining height, 300 m in panel width, and 13.47 to 20.58 m/d in advancing speed, respectively. The field measurement results of the PWI and ground cracks have verified the validity using the overburden damage degree to determine high-intensity mining parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Using discrete element software, namely, particle flow code as two-dimensional program (PFC2D), two types of models were established: vertical fissure hole combination and horizontal fissure hole combination with ratios of major and minor axis of ellipse being 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2, and 3, which corresponded to a total of ten samples. The failure mode, mechanical behavior, and stress state before and after crack generation in elliptical hole crack combination models with different ratios of major and minor axis were analyzed. The crack development, stress field evolution, and acoustic emission characteristics of the vertical fissure model and horizontal fissure model were studied at the optimized ratio of major and minor axis of ellipse being 1.5. The results showed that elliptical hole fissure with different ratios of major and minor axis resulted in the decrease in the strength and elastic modulus of rock and increase in the peak strain of rock. The effect of the horizontal fissure model on the peak strength, peak strain, and elastic modulus of rock was found to be greater than that of the vertical fissure hole model. Ellipses with different ratios of major and minor axis in various models slightly influenced the rock failure modes, and their failure modes corresponded to tensile shear failure and tensile failure. Before crack formation, the tensile stress concentration areas of each model were, respectively, distributed at the upper and lower ends of the vertical fissure and the major axis of ellipse, and the compressive stress concentration areas were distributed at both ends of the major axis of ellipse and the fissure in the horizontal direction. After the model failed, the compressive stress concentration areas of the vertical fissure model and the horizontal fissure model transferred to the left upper part and the right upper part of the model along the left end of the hole and the right end of the fissure, respectively. When the ratio of major and minor axis of ellipse was 1.5, cracks in the vertical model and the horizontal model of fissure developed along the axial direction at the ends of cracks and holes, respectively, and then secondary cracks were generated at the ends of left and right sides. The maximum compressive stress in each stage of the vertical fissure model was greater than that of the horizontal fissure model, and when the model was damaged, its stress release was more.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a rare complication following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and current management guidelines are still evolving. This report presents a novel surgical technique of resection arthroplasty with an articulated hemispacer as part of a 2-stage exchange protocol. A 66-year-old man developed a culture-negative PJI four months after a medial UKA. Rather than conventional full resection arthroplasty, the patient underwent partial resection with preservation of the lateral and patellofemoral compartments to maintain vascularized bone stock. An articulating hemispacer fashioned from the old implants after sterilization was reimplanted medially to preserve function during the course of antibiotic treatment. After successful eradication of infection, the patient underwent an uncomplicated conversion total knee replacement facilitated by prior preservation of bone stock. No stems or augments were needed. Therefore, a partial resection arthroplasty with an articulating hemispacer used in a 2-stage exchange protocol may be a reasonable option to eradicate infection and maintain function. In future cases of infected UKA, this technique warrants further consideration and investigation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of this study was to obtain the candidate genes and biomarkers that are significantly related to cardioembolic stroke (CS) by applying bioinformatics analysis. In accordance with the results of the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in the GSE58294 dataset, 11 CS-related coexpression network modules were identified in this study. Correlation analysis showed that the black and pink modules are significantly associated with CS. A total of 18 core genes in the black module and one core gene in the pink module were determined. We then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of CS at 3 h, 5 h, and 24 h postonset. After performing intersection, it was found that 311 genes were coexpressed at these three time points. These genes were majorly enriched in positive regulation of transferase activity and regulation of peptidase activity. The abovementioned coexpressed DEGs were subjected to protein-protein interaction analysis and subnetwork module analysis. Subsequently, we used cytoHubba to obtain 11 key genes from DEGs. The intersection of the core genes screened from WGCNA and the key genes selected from DEGs yielded the MAPK14 gene. The expression level of MAPK14 on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of CS at 3 h, 5 h, and 24 h showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.923, 0.934, and 0.941, respectively. In a nutshell, MAPK14 screened out by using WGCNA showed differential expression in CS. We conclude that MAPK14 can be used as a potential biological marker of CS and exhibits potential to predict the physiopathological condition of CS patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of compound formula Rehmannia (CFR) against the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). After the in vivo and in vitro models of PD were established with overexpression α-syn induced, CFR was administrated into the PD model rats for 6 weeks or SK-N-SH cells with coincubation for 48 h. Apomorphine-induced rotation test, CCK8 assay, TUNEL assay, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot assay were performed to evaluate the behavioral changes, cell viability, cell apoptosis, α-syn, GSK-3β, P-GSK-3β (Ser9), P-GSK-3β (Tyr216), and β-catenin expression in PD rats or SK-N-SH cells. PD rat behavior results showed that the rotation numbers were significantly decreased in the CFR treatment group comparing with the AAV-α-syn PD model group. The cell viability suppressed by H2O2 and α-syn in SK-N-SH model cells was also significantly improved with CFR administration. Cell apoptosis and α-syn overexpression observed in PD rats and SK-N-SH cells were also inhibited by CFR treatment. Furthermore, the protein expression of α-syn, GSK-3β, P-GSK-3β (Ser9), P-GSK-3β (Tyr216), and β-catenin in in vivo and in vitro was also significantly regulated by CFR. The present study suggested that CFR may be considered as a potential neuroprotective agent against PD, and this application will require further investigation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recent research findings imply that the slope aspect has a great impact on soil genesis and soil microclimate. The microclimate has a significant effect on the soil geobiochemical processes taking place in the soil. However, the slope aspect impact on soil properties has not been yet studied well in Ethiopia, particularly in the northern highlands. This research was initiated to link selected soil physicochemical properties with slope aspects under different land use practices. The research was conducted in Gumara-Maksegnit watershed located at the upper Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. Four slope aspects, eastward (Ew), northward (Nw), southward (Sw), and westward (Ww), and three land use types at each slope aspect, cropland (Cl), forest land (Fl), and grazing land (Gl), were considered. In total, 36 undisturbed soil samples for bulk density and 36 disturbed soil samples for selected soil properties were collected. Soil particle size (texture), bulk density, electrical conductivity (EC), soil pH, available phosphorus (av. P), available potassium (av. K), total nitrogen (TN), and soil organic carbon (SOC) were analyzed. The resulting analyses showed no significant variation (p&lt;0.05) across both slope aspects and/or land use types for soil pH and EC, whereas the slope aspect showed a significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on SOC, TN, av. K, and av. P. The highest significant (p&lt;0.05) mean value of SOC was observed in the Ww (3.04%) followed by Nw (2.52%) but SOC was not significant (p&lt;0.05) between Sw and Ew. While the highest av. K (1233.2 centimole/kilogram) and av. phosphorus (35.76 ppm) were observed in Nw slope aspect, the highest TN was in the Ww slope aspect (0.24%). The significant effect (p&lt;0.05) of land uses can be summarized as Fl &gt; Gl &gt; Cl for SOC and TN. A strong positive correlation was observed between SOC and TN (R2 = 0.997) and av. K and av. P (R2 = 0.58) at p&lt;0.05. Generally, the slope aspect, land use types, and their interaction had a significant effect on soil physicochemical properties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The traditional A∗ algorithm is time-consuming due to a large number of iteration operations to calculate the evaluation function and sort the OPEN list. To achieve real-time path-planning performance, a hardware accelerator’s architecture called A∗ accelerator has been designed and implemented in field programmable gate array (FPGA). The specially designed 8-port cache and OPEN list array are introduced to tackle the calculation bottleneck. The system-on-a-chip (SOC) design is implemented in Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA to evaluate A∗ accelerator. Experiments show that the hardware accelerator achieves 37–75 times performance enhancement relative to software implementation. It is suitable for real-time path-planning applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It was not clear how and whether neural stem cells (NSCs) responded to toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the inflammatory environment after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The current study investigated the correlation of TLR2 and NSC proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) using the TBI model of rats. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to observe the expression of BrdU, nestin, and TLR2 in the DG in morphology. Proliferating cells in the DG were labelled by thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Three-labelled BrdU, nestin, and DAPI was used for the identification of newly generated NSCs. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to observe the expression of TLR2 from the level of protein and mRNA. We observed that BrdU+/nestin+/DAPI+ cells accounted for 84.30%±6.54% among BrdU+ cells; BrdU+ and nestin+ cells in the DG were also TLR2+ cells. BrdU+ cells and the expression of TLR2 (both protein and mRNA levels) both elevated immediately at 6 hours (h), 24 h, 3 days (d), and 7 d posttrauma and peaked in 3 d. Results indicated that TLR2 was expressed on proliferating cells in the DG (NSCs possibly) and there was a potential correlation between increased TLR2 and proliferated NSCs after TBI. Taken together, these findings suggested that TLR2 was involved in endogenous neurogenesis in the DG after TBI.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>A. Altun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Purpose. We aimed at reminding that X-linked retinoschisis may also be seen in female patients and share our vitreoretinal surgical experience. Methods. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy including the closure of the macular holes with inverted ILM flap technique bilaterally. Lens extractions were performed by phacoemulsification during the removal of silicone oil endotamponade. Patient. An 18-year-old girl with X-linked retinoschisis and large macular holes in both eyes presented to the clinic of ophthalmology. It was confirmed that the patient had RS1 mutation Results. Nine-month-follow-up was uneventful for retinal findings. Significant improvement in visual acuity was achieved, and macular holes were remained closed. Conclusion. In cases with large macular holes due to XLR, an inverted ILM flap technique might be safe and effective. Four-month-silicone-endotamponade might be sufficient.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A graph is said to be a regular graph if all its vertices have the same degree; otherwise, it is irregular. In general, irregularity indices are used for computational analysis of nonregular graph topological composition. The creation of irregular indices is based on the conversion of a structural graph into a total count describing the irregularity of the molecular design on the map. It is important to be notified how unusual a molecular structure is in various situations and problems in structural science and chemistry. In this paper, we will compute irregularity indices of certain networks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper, the global Mittag–Leffler stabilization of fractional-order BAM neural networks is investigated. First, a new lemma is proposed by using basic inequality to broaden the selection of Lyapunov function. Second, linear state feedback control strategies are designed to induce the stability of fractional-order BAM neural networks. Third, based on constructed Lyapunov function, generalized Gronwall-like inequality, and control strategies, several sufficient conditions for the global Mittag–Leffler stabilization of fractional-order BAM neural networks are established. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ship target detection is an important guarantee for the safe passage of ships on the river. However, the ship image in the river is difficult to recognize due to the factors such as clouds, buildings on the bank, and small volume. In order to improve the accuracy of ship target detection and the robustness of the system, we improve YOLOv3 network and present a new method, called Ship-YOLOv3. Firstly, we preprocess the inputting image through guided filtering and gray enhancement. Secondly, we use k-means++ clustering on the dimensions of bounding boxes to get good priors for our model. Then, we change the YOLOv3 network structure by reducing part of convolution operation and adding the jump join mechanism to decrease feature redundancy. Finally, we load the weight of PASCAL VOC dataset into the model and train it on the ship dataset. The experiment shows that the proposed method can accelerate the convergence speed of the network, compared with the existing YOLO algorithm. On the premise of ensuring real-time performance, the precision of ship identification is improved by 12.5%, and the recall rate is increased by 11.5%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The problem of integrated fault detection and fault tolerant control for switched systems with asynchronous switching is focused on in this paper. Based on the switched model, the inherent asynchronous switching is taken into consideration. The asynchronous switching means that the switching of filters/controllers will always lag behind the switching of modes, which will degrade the performance of the closed-loop system. The Lyapunov functional method and mode-dependent average dwell time method are combined for the analysis of the finite-time stability of the switched system. The properties of each subsystem are taken into consideration, which are less conservative. To achieve optimal performance, the filters and controllers are designed simultaneously. The parameters of filters and controllers are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities. In the end, the numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper aims to contribute to the fault-tolerant control of the current sensor. The system studied is a double star induction machine (DSIM) controlled by a robust control called Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC). The proposed method makes it possible to detect, isolate, and reconfigure the fault in real time. The reconfiguration is based on the comparison between the values measured by the current sensors and the estimated values. Two voltage observers will be used to estimate the estimated currents, and these two observers are placed at the level of the converters. This method of fault-tolerant control (FTC) has the advantage of ensuring, even in the presence of a sensor fault, the continuity of the system’s operation and maintaining its performance at the desired level. The effectiveness of the FTC strategy proposed in this work is illustrated with simulations carried out under the MATLAB/Simulink environment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In hybrid cloud environments, reasonable data placement strategies are critical to the efficient execution of scientific workflows. Due to various loads, bandwidth fluctuations, and network congestions between different data centers as well as the dynamics of hybrid cloud environments, the data transmission time is uncertain. Thus, it poses huge challenges to the efficient data placement for scientific workflows. However, most of the traditional solutions for data placement focus on deterministic cloud environments, which lead to the excessive data transmission time of scientific workflows. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the fuzzy theory and genetic algorithm operators (DPSO-FGA) to minimize the fuzzy data transmission time of scientific workflows. The DPSO-FGA can rationally place the scientific workflow data while meeting the requirements of data privacy and the capacity limitations of data centers. Simulation results show that the DPSO-FGA can effectively reduce the fuzzy data transmission time of scientific workflows in hybrid cloud environments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>At present, there are few relevant studies on the intensive sea use, and few scholars have provided qualitative and quantitative research examples on the interaction and interaction coupling relationship between intensive sea use and the marine economy. This study constructs comprehensive evaluation indicator systems using the Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt as the research object. The set pair analysis method is used to obtain comprehensive results, and the coupling coordination degree model is employed to carry out an in-depth analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the interaction between intensive sea use and the marine economy. The results show the following. (1) The six cities in the Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt exhibited a fluctuating upward trend in the composite index for intensive sea use, but the intensive sea use level differed among the cities. The intensive sea use level of Huludao was the lowest among the six cities. (2) All cities in the Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt witnessed an upward trend in the marine economy development index, and the gaps between the cities gradually narrowed. The marine economy development index was ranked from top to bottom as follows: Jinzhou, Panjin, Dalian, Yingkou, Dandong, and Huludao. (3)The coupling coordination degree between intensive sea use and marine economy development was relatively stable in Dalian, Jinzhou, Yingkou, and Panjin, ranging approximately from 0.76 to 0.96, which indicates that the four cities witnessed good coordination between sea area utilization and marine economy development. The coupling coordination degree of Dandong and Huludao were relatively low, and Huludao consistently witnessed a low value.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The intrauterine device (IUD) is one of the most effective contraceptive methods. Its Pearl Index is less than 1 per 100 women. It is the most used method around the world: about 100 million users. However, its insertion can cause certain complications, such as infection, expulsion, or perforation essentially when the rules of use are poorly applied. Perforation remains exceptional but one of the most serious complications. Indeed, after a perforation, the IUD could be located in different neighboring organs. We report a new case of IUD ectopic location in the peritoneal cavity, which was diagnosed 7 years after the insertion and as part of the renal colic assessment. The surgery was performed to remove the IUD which was embedded in the peritoneum and compresses the ureter and causes dilation upstream. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of an ectopic location in the retroperitoneal space of an intrauterine device.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Accurate diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is crucial for management and prognosis but can be challenging even for experienced clinicians. Expert multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) is considered the reference standard for ILD diagnosis; however, there remain concerns regarding lack of validation studies and relative limited information on the impact of MDD in real-life clinical practice. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of MDD in providing a specific ILD diagnosis, changing the diagnosis provided upon referral, and to determine how often and in which way MDD altered management. Material and Methods. Retrospective observational study in an ILD referral tertiary academic center. MDD diagnoses were categorized as specific, provisional, and unclassifiable ILD. Pre-MDD and MDD diagnoses were compared for change in diagnosis and concordance rates for specific diagnoses. Relevant change in management including initiation or change in pharmacological treatment, referral to surgical biopsy, and nonpharmacological management were recorded. Results. 126 cases were included (79M, 47F, 36–93 years, mean 70 y). Specific MDD diagnosis was provided in 62% (78/126); 12% (15/126) had provisional diagnosis, and 21% (27/126) was unclassifiable. Overall agreement for specific pre-MDD and MDD diagnosis was 41% (52/126) and 80% for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis. MDD altered diagnosis in 37% (47/126) and changed management in 39% (50/126). Amongst concordant diagnoses, management was altered in 46% (24/52). In summary, MDD provided a specific diagnosis discordant with pre-MDD diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases and was particularly valuable in the diagnosis of non-IPF ILD. MDD often altered management and had relevant impact on management even in cases with concordant pre-MDD diagnosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Reasonable spatial organization of the tourism industry can improve the utilization efficiency of regional tourism industry elements. Taking Dalian City in China as an example, this paper collects various types of tourism industry data and introduces GIS network analysis technology into tourism studies to determine the location, scale, and number of tourism nodes in Dalian and optimize the spatial organization nodes and organization models of the tourism industry. This will help ease the pressure on tourism reception in the southern area of Dalian and promote better development and utilization of tourism resources and tourism facilities in the central and northern regions. The results show that (1) when using the “minimizing facility points” model, a total of 17 second-level tourism nodes and 5 first-level tourism nodes are obtained after optimization. The location of these nodes is highly correlated with the level of tourist scenic spots, while tourist scenic spots play a significant role in leading and driving tourism nodes. (2) Using the “maximum coverage” model for optimization, 3138 tourism enterprises are connected with tourism nodes, thus realizing the shortest traffic path between tourism enterprises and tourism nodes, which minimizes the total cost of network services. Compared with suburban areas, enterprises in urban tourism areas are densely distributed, meaning that a smaller service radius of tourism nodes can cover more enterprises. (3) A total of 10 first-level tourism channels and 12 second-level tourism channels are optimized using the “nearest facility” model. The first-level tourism channels are mainly distributed in the central and southern areas of Dalian. These channels connect nodes mainly through national and provincial roads. The second-level tourism channels are mainly distributed in the central and northern areas of Dalian. (4) This study aims to analyze the evolution process of the spatial organization mode of Dalian’s tourism industry and construct a hub-spoke network tourism industry spatial organization mode composed of 17 hubs, 22 spokes, and 22 tourism domains. The analysis and construction are designed according to the optimization results of tourism nodes and tourism channels. The research results enrich the theories and technical means of tourism industry spatial organization and provide references and suggestions for local governments or tourism planning decision-makers; they also provide a scientific basis for the rational allocation of tourism industry elements and promote the rational distribution of tourism industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As an extension of fuzzy sets, hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy set is a new mathematical tool for dealing with fuzzy problems, but it still has the problem with the inadequacy of the parametric tools. In order to further improve the accuracy of decision making, a new mixed mathematical model, named hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy soft set, is constructed by combining hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy sets with soft sets. Firstly, some related theories of hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy sets are discussed. Secondly, the concept of hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy soft set is given, and the algorithms of complement, union, intersection, “AND,” and “OR” are defined. Based on the above algorithms, the corresponding results of operation are analyzed and the relevant properties are discussed. Finally, a multiattribute decision-making method of hesitant bipolar-valued fuzzy soft sets is proposed by using the idea of score function and level soft sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Sarah J. Wordie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) affects the posterior cranial fossa resulting in characteristic dysmorphic facial and body features. Scoliosis is not typically reported as an extracranial manifestation of this condition. We present a 12-year-old female patient who developed a right thoracic scoliosis measuring 60° with increased lumbar lordosis. Scoliosis correction was indicated to alleviate back pain, improve cosmesis, and prevent respiratory complications. A multidisciplinary preoperative assessment included cardiac, respiratory, anaesthetic, and neurology reviews. She underwent a posterior spinal fusion from T2 to L3 with pedicle hook/screw and rod instrumentation and a combination of locally harvested autologous and allograft bone. This resulted in excellent deformity correction and a balanced spine in the coronal and sagittal planes. The patient made an uneventful recovery and returned gradually to her normal level of activities. She was monitored in clinic until she completed her growth (4 years after surgery); the satisfactory surgical outcome was maintained at follow-up and was associated with high patient satisfaction. Scoliosis can occur in children with DWS with resemblance to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in regard to type of coronal deformity, age at presentation, surgical techniques, and postoperative recovery. Early identification of scoliosis in patients with DWS can allow preoperative planning and prompt surgical management in order to reduce the risk of significant morbidity which can occur if the scoliosis is allowed to deteriorate. Excellent deformity correction can be achieved and maintained beyond skeletal maturity in order to improve physical appearance, as well as preserve level of function and quality of life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inflammatory pseudotumors (IPTs) are benign masses arising from nonspecific inflammatory conditions including surgical invasion. We herein report the rare case of an IPT mimicking port-site metastasis in a 69-year-old patient who underwent retroperitoneal robotic partial nephrectomy for stage T1a renal cell carcinoma. Radiological examination performed six months after the surgery revealed the presence of a mass underneath the abdominal wall which coincided with a port site. The tumor was resected by laparoscopic transperitoneal approach, and histological examination led to the diagnosis of an IPT that consists of xanthogranulomatous inflammation. We also discuss the etiology of IPT formation and features distinguishing IPTs from port-site metastasis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tone mapping operators are designed to display high dynamic range (HDR) images on low dynamic range devices. Clustering-based content and color adaptive tone mapping algorithm aims to maintain the color information and local texture. However, fine details can still be lost in low dynamic range images. This paper presents an effective way of clustering-based content and color adaptive tone mapping algorithm by using fast search and find of density peak clustering. The suggested clustering method reduces the loss of local structure and allows better adaption of color in images. The experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of proposed technique with state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The objective and subjective evaluation results reveal that fast search and find of density peak preserves more textural information. Therefore, it is most suitable to be used for clustering-based content and color adaptive tone mapping algorithm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives. Caries remains a problem in high-risk groups aggravated by socioeconomic inequalities. The study aimed to investigate (1) oral health practices associated with caries in the 1st permanent molars in Saudi male teenagers and (2) the impact of socioeconomic position (SEP) on caries control using these practices. Methods. A cross-sectional study targeted 1137 male teenagers in intermediate schools in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, in 2016. Caries was examined using the World Health Organization criteria and plaque was assessed using the plaque index of Loe and Silness. A questionnaire assessed SEP (parental education, employment, and home ownership) and oral health practices (using fluoridated toothpaste twice daily, regular dental visits for check-ups, and avoiding daily sugary snacks). Regression models analysed the association of these factors with caries presence and the mean number of decayed 1st permanent molars. Stratification was used to assess differences between SEP levels. Results. The response rate was 81.7%. Caries prevalence and mean (SD) number of decayed 1st permanent molars were 50.4% and 1.08 (1.31). The use of fluoride toothpaste was associated with lower odds of caries and fewer decayed molars (OR = 0.50 and regression coefficient = −0.35). Differences in the relationship between caries and toothpaste were observed by SEP levels with stronger associations in less advantaged groups. Conclusions. Brushing twice daily using fluoride toothpaste was associated with less caries in Saudi male teenagers with stronger association observed in groups with lower SEP. The use of fluoride toothpaste helps in reducing health inequalities associated with SEP.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is a bacterial disease of small ruminants causing abscesses in lymph nodes of the body and internal organs. A longitudinal study from 2011 to 2019 was undertaken at Ataye site of Debre Birhan Research Center to estimate the prevalence and incidence, identify associated risk factors, and characterize the causative bacteria. 1025 goats were followed up for the CLA study. Survival analysis was done using SAS 9.4 software program. Biochemical tests and Biolog microbial identification system were used to characterize the bacteria. In the recurrent survival data analysis, there were 1,138 clinical observations and 214 CLA cases (18.8% prevalence) based on clinical diagnosis. The incidence rate was 0.14 cases per animal year. From a total of 214 cases, 130 have occurred once and 84 cases are recurrent cases following first cases. The cumulative failure rates were 68% for newborn and 64% for yearling age groups. The parotid lymph node was the most frequently affected site. Proportional hazard analysis results showed that sex, age, and breed were associated (p&lt;0.05) with CLA incidence. Females, newborn age group, Boer, and Boer × Central Highland Goat (CHG) were at higher risks compared to males, yearling age group, and CHG goats, respectively. The present study indicated that a high incidence rate of CLA in the goat farm is difficult to control and prevent because of its poor response to clinical treatment. Thus, control and prevention should focus on the spread of the disease such as isolation of clinically sick animals, culling, and vaccination of flocks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Highway bridge load rating has been moving toward structural reliability since the issuance of AASHTO LRFR specifications; however, the recommended load factors were carried out by a few reliable truck data. The objective of this study is to calibrate the live load factor in AASHTO LRFR Rating Specification by using huge amount of WIM data collected in California for more than ten years between 2001 and 2013. Since traffic volumes, vehicular overloads, and traffic components are highly related to the load effect induced, a set of calibration equations is proposed here, in which the nominal standard load effect models are used and different requirements of loading are taken into account. By the analytical model of platoons of trucks and the extrapolation of the gathered WIM data over a short period of time to remote future over a longer time period, the expected maximum live load effects over the rating period of 5 years are also obtained. Then, the live load factor is calibrated as the product of the codified value multiplied by the ratio between the nominal standard load effect and the expected mean value. The results show that the products of the two ratios present rather constant, implying the proposed method and load configurations selected are effective. In the end, the live load factors of 1.0 and 0.7 along with load configurations are recommended for a simple span length less than 300 ft. The recommended calibration method and live load factors will eliminate the unnecessary overconservatism in rating specifications.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ya-Qiong Wang</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ming-Rui Luo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The core content of the convergence constraint method is to determine the reasonable support time and support stiffness. The stiffness of shotcrete in supporting structure is dynamic. The support stiffness of shotcrete is roughly calculated in engineering, which results in a waste of materials and increases the risk of construction. Therefore, in this study, considering the time-varying characteristics of shotcrete, combined with the elastic-plastic theory and the space effect of excavation surface, the calculation equation describing the support reaction curve is given. An example is given to show that the stiffness of shotcrete considering time-varying effect is lower than that of shotcrete without time-varying effect, and the difference is the most obvious in the age of 0–3 days. However, in the later stage, the stiffness growth rate of shotcrete considering time-varying effect is higher than that of shotcrete without time-varying effect. This study can predict the whole process of the support reaction curve, which can make the application of the convergence constraint method in tunnel support design more accurate, and provide a theoretical basis for the design of supporting structure in the process of tunnel construction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Dynamic tensile failure is one of the main failure modes of layered rock masses during the excavation of underground engineering. This study investigates the influence of loading rate and layered inclination angle on the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of layered slate using a split-Hopkinson pressure bar system and high-speed cameras. The results show that, overall, the dynamic elastic modulus E, postpeak stress reduction rate K, and failure load of the discs with the 7 tested bedding angles increase with the increasing loading rate. A nonlinear formula is proposed to describe the relationship between loading rate and failure load for the 7 tested inclination angles. As the inclination angle of the bedding planes increases from 0° to 90°, both the static and dynamic failure loads of the slate increased. However, with increasing loading rate, the anisotropic influence coefficient N ranges from 3.25 under the static load to 1.35 under the dynamic load, and the bedding effect gradually decreases. From the dynamic Brazilian splitting tests, the failure of the discs is mainly observed along the bedding planes when the inclination angle is less than or equal to 45°. Failure of the discs mainly occurs along the centre of the disc and previously intact planes when the inclination angle is greater than 60°. This study provides significant data to evaluate the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of layered rock and the safety and stability of layered rock under dynamic loading.</dc:description>

<dc:description>No unified criterion exists for the transition threshold of rock mechanical characteristics. We combine rock stress-strain curves to propose an increment ratio of axial pressure based on uniaxial compression tests on granite at high temperature. The behavior of the increment ratio of strain, elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and energy with axial pressure is analyzed, and the following conclusions are drawn. (1) High temperatures aggravate rock deterioration, reduce failure strength, and enhance ductility characteristics. (2) Under loading, the compression-to-elasticity and elasticity-to-plasticity transition thresholds for rock occur, respectively, at 20%–35% and 75%–80% stress levels at temperatures of 25–800°C. (3) The source data for calculating rock deformation parameters or unloading points for unloading tests can be selected over the stress level range of 35%–75%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The HLLEM approximate Riemann solver can capture discontinuities sharply, maintain positive definiteness, and satisfy the entropy condition automatically. These attractive properties make the HLLEM scheme widely used in the simulations of many compressible fluid problems. However, in the simulations of low Mach incompressible flow, the accuracy of HLLEM solver cannot be guaranteed. In the current study, a detailed discrete asymptotic analysis is conducted on the HLLEM scheme and the responsible terms for the loss of accuracy are identified. This allows us to develop two modified methods to solve this low Mach number problem. The first method is to add a low Mach number correction term on the basis of the original HLLEM scheme. The second is to simply rescale the responsible terms with a Mach number-based function. The asymptotic analysis of these two low Mach correction methods shows that the difference between the continuous system and the discrete system disappears, which means the resulting LM-HLLEM and LM-HLLEM2 schemes are both capable of obtaining physically correct solutions in low Mach limit. The results obtained from various test cases demonstrate that both these two HLLEM-type schemes can simulate incompressible and compressible fluid problems accurately and robustly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper deals with thermal analysis of realistic models of the human eye and brain using the finite element method. The research presented in this paper is the sequel to the electromagnetic dosimetry model presented in the previous work by the authors. The paper presents the numerical results for the specific absorption rate (SAR) and the related temperature increase in various models of the human eye and the brain/head exposed to high-frequency (HF) electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Based on the numerical results for the induced electric field, the distribution of SAR in the human brain and human eye is determined, subsequently used as input to the thermal model. The thermal dosimetry model of both the brain and eye are based on the form of Pennes’ bioheat transfer equation, numerically solved using the finite element method (FEM). The comparison between the extracted models and the compound models of both the eye and brain, placed inside the realistic head model is presented. In case of the human eye, generally, comparable results were obtained for both SAR and temperature increase, while the compound eye model is found to be more suitable when the polarization of incident wave is considered. Moreover, the extracted eye model underestimated the temperature rise, attributed to better heat exchange than the compound model. The results for the compound eye indicate that in some situations, the eye lens could be omitted from simulation, facilitating the model preparation. The numerical results for all three brain models showed similar distributions of SAR and temperature rise. Also, the obtained results show that the peak SAR does not exceed the basic restriction limit for localized SAR, for occupational exposure. The thermal dosimetry assessment of the human brain exposed in four considered scenarios indicates the temperature should not exceed 0.1°C. Finally, the use of a geometrically simplified model may also be found useful in the initial dosimetry assessment prior to dealing with models with more anatomical features.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Most developing countries face huge challenges in the medical field; scarce medical resources and inadequate medical personnel will affect the development and stability of the society. Therefore, for most developing countries, the development of intelligent medical systems can greatly alleviate the social contradictions arising from this problem. In this study, a new data decision-making intelligent system for prostate cancer based on perceptron neural network is proposed, which mainly makes decisions by associating some relevant disease indicators and combining them with medical images. Through data collection, analysis and integration of medical data, as well as the disease detection and decision-making process, patients are given an auxiliary diagnosis and treatment, so as to solve the problems and social contradictions faced by most developing countries. Through the study of hospitalization information of more than 8,000 prostate patients in three hospitals, about 2,156,528 data items were collected and compiled for experiment purposes. Experimental data shows that when the patient base increases from 200 to 8,000, the accuracy of the machine-assisted diagnostic system will increase from 61% to 87%, and the doctor’s diagnosis rate will be reduced to 81%. From the study, it is concluded that when the patient base reaches a certain number, the diagnostic accuracy of the machine-assisted diagnosis system will exceed the doctor’s expertise. Therefore, intelligent systems can help doctors and medical experts treat patients more effectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) is an effective strategy for revascularization. Preoperative anesthesia appears critical due to surgical instability and the risk of organ damage. This study, based on a functional module network, analysed the effects of preoperative inhalation anesthesia and intravenous anesthesia on OPCABG and performed a pivot analysis of its potential drug regulators. We obtained microarray data of sevoflurane anesthesia and propofol anesthesia from the GEO database and analysed the difference between the two groups of data, resulting in 5701 and 3210 differential genes to construct the expression matrix. WGCNA analysis showed that sevoflurane anesthesia clustered into 7 functional disorder modules, including PDCD6IP, WDR3, and other core genes; propofol anesthesia clustered to form two functional disorder modules, including KCNB2 and LHX2, two core genes Enrichment analysis of the functions and pathways of interest suggests that both anesthesia-related module genes tend to function as pathways associated with ion and transmembrane transport. The underlying mechanism may be that targeted regulation of transmembrane-associated biological processes and ion pathways in the core genes of each module affect the surgical process. Pivot analysis of potential drug regulators revealed 229 potential drugs for sevoflurane anesthesia surgery, among which zinc regulates three functional disorder modules via AHSG, F12, etc., and 67 potential drugs for propofol anesthesia surgery, among which are propofol, methadone, and buprenorphine, regulate two functional disorder modules through four genes, CYP2C8, OPRM1, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19. This study provides guidance on clinical use or treatment by comparing the effects of two anesthesias on surgery and its potential drugs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to see whether it is possible to eradicate the disease theoretically using mathematical modeling with the aid of numerical simulation when disease occurs in a population by implementing adequate preventive measures. For this, we consider a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of cholera and its preventive measure as one cohort of individuals, namely, a protected cohort in addition to susceptible, infected, and recovered cohorts of individuals including the concentration of Vibrio cholerae in the contaminated aquatic reservoir with small modifications. We calculate the basic reproduction number, ℛ0, and investigate the existence and stability of equilibria. The model possessed forward bifurcation. Moreover, we compute the sensitivity indices of each parameter in relating to ℛ0 of the model. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate our theoretical results. The result indicates that the disease dies out in areas with adequate preventive measures and widespread and kills more people in areas with the inadequate preventive measures.</dc:description>
