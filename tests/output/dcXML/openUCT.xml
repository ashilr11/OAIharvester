   <dc:description>This thesis is focused on architectural theories and design concepts which will add to the discourse of the what learning environments should or could be in the 21st century. It is based on the idea that spaces for learning need to be more “alive and that architecture can stimulate positive social interaction between people. The current public education system and its related standards, requirements and policies, with regards to physical learning spaces, does not address the present needs of children as it ought to. Many schools in South Africa are not built and designed to function as sustainable buildings and they often do not cater for the economic, environmental or social needs of current and future learners, teachers and community members.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Hidden treasures in Ivory Towers : the potential of university art collections in South Africa, with a case study of UCT</dc:title>

   <dc:description>This dissertation takes as its central theme the context of a university as a setting for artworks. While globally many university art collections enjoy prominent status in their communities, and are well endowed and visited, their South African counterparts are sorely underused and valued. Thus, the aim of the study is twofold; in the first instance, an argument is made for the positive and productive role South African university art collections can play within their society - and primary research reveals the rich and varied collections held throughout the country. The second focus is on one particular case study: the University of Cape Town (UCT) art collection, and the acquisition body that oversees it, the Works of Art Committee (WOAC). Through a detailed analysis of this committee's thirty-year archive, and informed by the experience of an extensive internship with the WOAC, the study provides an overview of their operation, assessing their successes and failures. What is revealed is that there are numerous problems inherent within the way in which this committee is run, and the management of the art collection in general. Aside from compositional issues within the committee itself, the fact that there is no educational integration between the collection and the university community, is highly problematic. As such, numerous suggestions are offered, with the hope that the collection can become a more meaningful presence to those on campus, and beyond. For, with a far healthier acquisition budget than the South African National Gallery, and access to a large and diverse audience, it seems as though a highly exciting opportunity is being overlooked.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Context – The prevalence of problem substance use is a global concern, particularly for adolescents due to their ongoing developmental changes. Amongst other contributory factors, parenting styles adopted by parents and caregivers can either; increase the risks of their children developing substance misuse problems or prevent its onset. Knowledge about the needs and experiences of the caregivers of adolescents who misuse substances is limited and greatly under-researched. Brief interventions (BIs) have been identified as an effective means of tackling this problem-type behaviour among adolescents, including ‘Teen Intervene', which was developed in the US. This evidence-based intervention included a parent component which has been found to further enhance the interventions' positive outcomes. Rationale – In light of the unique caregiver structures in South Africa, the general neglect of their needs in the South African literature with regards to interventions and the high prevalence of adolescent substance misuse in the Western Cape, exploring these needs within the country's context is warranted and necessary. Design and data collection – This was a qualitative study and data for the study was collected in two main phases: through focus group discussions to identify caregivers needs and to explore perceptions of the intervention; and post-intervention interviews with caregivers and adolescents at a 1-month follow-up session. Findings – Template analysis revealed six main themes: 1) Access to knowledge about substance misuse; 2) Parenting skills; 3) Sources of emotional support; 4) Empowerment for female caregivers; 5) Financial concerns; and 6) Alternative solutions to adolescent's involvement in the justice system. Caregivers also reported various feelings that are a direct result of their experiences. Discussion – Caregivers have distinct needs that require designated responses, however, some of these needs can be addressed through their inclusion in treatment interventions for adolescents who misuse substances.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Geminiviruses replicate via a rolling circle mechanism, which initiates at the origin of replication located within the long intergenic region (LIR). The viral replication associated-protein (Rep) in conjunction with the host's DNA replication machinery is responsible for the initiation and termination of the replication cycle from a stem-loop structure, located within the LIR and conserved throughout the three genera of Geminiviridae. The specific interaction between the Rep protein with sequences within the intergenic region has been well characterised for the begomoviruses and to some extent the curtoviruses; however, this interaction in the mastreviruses, and in particular maize streak virus (MSV), has yet to be fully explored. A theoretical model has been proposed based on sequence data and informed by the current understanding of replication specificity in begomoviruses. Due to the lack of conservation of the stem sequence of the stem-loop structure amongst mastreviruses, the model implicates a pair of nucleotide sequence repeats called iterons. These are located within the stem structure, and on the complementary sense side of the LIR. The former is the putative site of Rep interaction with the LIR. These iterons would therefore potentially act as the determinants of replication specificity amongst mastreviruses.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Towards being heard : representations of the child's voice in custody evaluation reports by the Family Advocate's Office</dc:title>

   <dc:description>This study outlined the changing social and legal contexts insofar as it relates to children's participation in matters that affect their lives. It set out the debates in the literature on whether not children should participate in family law matters, specifically custody disputes, and if so, how this participation should take place. It also drew upon research studies which have explored directly children's views on the issue. The challenges involved in custody evaluations were scrutinised, specifically in relation to the Family Advocate's Office, and alternative and/or complementary methods of accessing the child's voice were considered. In South Africa, in all access and/or custody disputes, the Family Advocateâ€™s Office is tasked with making recommendations to the court, which are in the child's best interest. The recently promulgated provisions of the Children's Act (2005) also require that the child's views and wishes be taken into consideration. Accordingly, this research study involved a thematic content analysis of 10 Family Counsellor reports, in order to determine how the child's voice is accessed by the Family Advocate's Office. A structural model illustrating how the child's voice was represented in the reports was developed. It showed that the child's voice was represented in three distinct ways, namely: the child's voice is accessed directly; the child's voice is disqualified; and the archetypal child's voice is accessed through a proxy. The findings showed a tendency to rely more on accessing the archetypal child's voice through a proxy, which typically included reporting that was less descriptive and more inferential, interpretive and opinion-laden. A need for more direct, non-disqualified means of accessing and/or reporting on the child's views and wishes was indicated.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The introduction explicates the nature of narrative literary journalism and situates the four stories within this edifice. This body of work experiments with the classical form of narrative literary journalism. The Soul Searcher tells the story of the ethnomusicologist John Turest-Swartz who wants to promote the little known rural musician Louisa Steenkamp. It traces the development of an indigenous South African band over a period of one year. Thumeka in the Dunes is a career portrait in the context of urban nature conservation. The protagonist Thumeka Mdlazi is both part of the obstacle - the community threatening the nature reserve - and its solution, as a protector of the dunes. A Place to Live under the Rainbow deals with the repeated attacks against Somali refugees in South Africa portraying victims and perpetrators alike. On a meta-level, the story also reflects on the topic of xenophobia in a more discursive style. A Runner's Mind is a first-person creative non-fiction narrative. The core of the story is the motivation for ultra-marathon runner Randall Turner to keep running. This account is framed by my own personal reflections on running and non-running. All stories are anchored in a South African social setting and reflect people's struggles and small achievements in overcoming seemingly hopeless situations.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A retrospective audit of young patients diagnosed with cervical cancer over ten years at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2012, and their outcome at five-year follow-up compared to women in the prior decade</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background : Cervical cancer is the second commonest gynaecological cancer amongst women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths in developing countries – contributing 83% of new cases and 85% of all deaths annually to the burden of this disease. Information and awareness of this illness in the developing world is still inferior, and mortality is increasing. In the developing world, late presentation, advanced-stage disease and a poorly run screening programme (covering only 55% of the South African population) are all contributing factors to this statistic. Approximately 20% of all South African women in their reproductive age are also HIV positive. With the rising burden of cervical cancer and the emergence of HIV as an influencing comorbidity, South Africa adopted a national cervical screening programme, rolled out in 2000 as well as an HCT (HIV counselling and testing) programme formalised in 2011. With these initiatives now in place, this study examined trends and compared 5-year survival outcomes between two decades for cervical cancer among young women. Methods : The study undertook a retrospective audit of files and information on the pre-existing cervical cancer database, and appropriate data was extracted (HREC REF 344/2011). Survival and disease outcomes at five years, as well as time to recurrence, was assessed, together with other demographics of the study population. Patients included in the study were non-pregnant female patients, aged 40 years and younger at the time of registration with the Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH) Oncology Unit (LE 33). The diagnosis of cervical cancer had to have been confirmed histologically, as either squamous cell carcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Patients must have attended at the LE 33 unit on or from 1 January 1993 until and including 31 December 2012. The two decades were studied and 5-year outcomes from each decade were analysed and reviewed using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate analyses. The study compared data using Log Rank tests and p-values. Findings : The two decade-groups under study showed no difference in trends of survival regarding age, treatment type and histology. Albeit small numbers, adenocarcinoma was the histology that had the best probability of survival during both decades. There were more patients with early-stage cancer (stage 1 and 2) diagnosed in decade B (2003 – 2012) than A (1993 – 2002). Within this early-stage cervical cancer cohort, there is a trend toward more locally-advanced (stage 2) cancer in the more recent decade. The proportion of patients presenting with stage 1a and 1b cancer with tumours 4 cm and less has halved from decade A to decade B. The proportion of stage 2 cancers presenting with tumours 2 – 4cm in size during decade B has risen almost 3-fold to that of decade A. This suggests a developing trend of presentation of more locally-advanced cancer. During both decades, stage 1 cervical cancers had the best probability of survival, with an improvement in mean survival from decade A (average of 44 months) to decade B (average of 58 months). The trend of stage 2 disease has deteriorated, with a decrease in mean survival (from 48 months in decade A to 21 months in decade B), an increase in cancer-related deaths and a shorter time to relapse. The number of patients presenting with late-stage disease (stages 3 and 4) has declined. HIV positive status played an influential role in tumour size on presentation and probability of 5-year disease-free survival. Young women who were HIV positive also fared less favourably when compared to NP (not positive) women in terms of mean survival. Due to the small sample size and that the majority of patients in decade A were untested, further HIV comparisons were not credible. Interpretation : The study suggests a moving trend towards young patients that are being diagnosed with the more locally-advanced early-stage disease in the more recent decade than ten years prior. HIV status seemingly played an influential comorbid role in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. Patients with the locallyadvanced disease appear to have worse outcomes in the latter decade. In an attempt to curb this potentially curable disease in this subset of young women, a greater focus on earlier screening interventions, prompt diagnosis and appropriate and timeous treatment of cervical cancer, together with optimisation of comorbidities like HIV are needed.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Section 33 of the Constitution guarantees to everyone the right to just administrative action that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (“PAJA”) was promulgated to give effect to give effect to this fundamental right as envisaged in s 33(3) of the Constitution. Section 32 of the Constitution also guarantees to everyone the right of access to information. The Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 (“PAIA”) was promulgated to give effect to this fundamental right as contemplated in s 32(2) of the Constitution. This thesis considers the extent to which the provisions of PAJA may be applicable to the actions of the South African Legal Practice Council (“the LPC”). It also considers the extent to which the provisions of PAIA may be applicable to the records of the LPC. Some remedial legislative amendments to the provisions of both PAJA and PAIA are recommended with the view of addressing certain identified legal obstacles. The proposed legislative amendments will enhance the exercise, realisation, enforcement and protection of both the right to just administrative action and the right of access to information.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Transitions in care – including at the point of discharge from a hospital - may potentially place patients in a position of increased risk and vulnerability.(1) This is recognised to be of particular concern for paediatric patients, compounded by the fact that no widely accepted or used standards of care for paediatric discharge exist. Current research and quality improvement efforts to optimize care transitions in children are considered an essential contributor to reducing post hospitalization morbidity and improving family centred care. (2)(3) Care transitions are also considered especially challenging during the discharge process from the Emergency Centre. Effective patient education and follow-up arrangements may be compromised in the frequently fast paced, high patient volume environment often characterised by interruptions and distractions thus increasing the risk of medical error. This is further complicated by shift working healthcare providers who are required to treat unfamiliar patients of varying clinical acuity who present for care.(1)(4)(5)</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The growing burden of HIV and non- communicable disease (NCD) syndemic in Sub Saharan Africa, has necessitated introduction of integrated models of care in order to leverage existing HIV care infrastructure for NCDs. However, there is paucity of literature on long term treatment outcomes for multimorbid patients attending integrated care. We describe long term treatment outcomes among multimorbid patients who attended integrated ART and NCD clubs (IC), a novel model of care piloted in 2014 by the Western Cape Government in South Africa. We followed up multimorbid patients for 12 months, who enrolled for IC at Matthew Goniwe and Town II clinics before September 2016. Median adherence proportions, HIV viral suppression and retention rates were calculated at 12 months before and after IC enrolment. Rates for achieving targets for blood pressure and glycosylated haemoglobin were determined at 12 months prior, at IC enrolment and at 12 months post IC enrolment. We describe demographic and clinical variables among all patients at IC enrolment and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate for predictors of NCD control 12 months post IC enrolment. As of 31 August 2017, 247 patients in total had been enrolled into IC for at least 12 months. Of these, 221 (89.5%) had hypertension, 4 (1.6%) had diabetes mellitus and 22 (8.9%) had both in addition to HIV. Adherence was maintained before and after IC enrolment with median adherence proportions of 1 (IQR 1-1) and 1 (IQR 1-1) respectively. HIV viral suppression rates were 98.6%, 99.5% and 99.4% at the three time points respectively. Retention in care was high with 6.9% lost to follow up at 12 months post IC enrolment. Optimal blood pressure control was achieved in 43.1%, 58.9% and 49.4% of participants whereas optimal glycaemic control was achieved in 47.4%, 87.5% and 53.3% of diabetic participants at the three time points respectively. Multivariable logistic analyses showed no independent variables significantly associated with NCD control. Multi-morbid people living with HIV achieved high levels of HIV control in integrated HIV and NCD clubs. However, intensified interventions are needed to maintain NCD control in the long term.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Outcome after palliative cardiac surgery in a developing country</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Painter, Mark Llewellyn</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>Heart surgery - In infancy and childhood</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>Palliative treatment</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The outcome of 121 children who underwent palliative cardiac surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital over a 5 year period, 1980 1984, was retrospectively examined. 79 children had systemic artery to pulmonary artery shunt operations (SPS), 40 had pulmonary artery bands (PAB) and 2 had surgical septectomies. SPS was most often done for children with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF, 26 cases) or complex univentricular hearts with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (27 cases). PAB was done chiefly for ventricular septa! defects, alone (VSD, 8 cases) or with coarctation of the aorta (9 cases). Children were referred from a wide area with 63 cases being referred from other major centres and foreign countries. Overall, 36 children died (30 % mortality): 5 died at surgery, 6 within 48 hours of surgery, a further 5 within 31 days; and 20 died after 31 days. SPS and PAB had the same early mortality rates ( 13 % ) • SPS had higher late and overall mortality rates (20 and 33 %) than PAB (10 and 23 %). Age at operation was found to be the most significant determinant of the overall mortality rate: children less than six months had a mortality of 42 % and those over 6 months, 13 % • The children were grouped into those with lesions which were probably correctable and those that were unlikely to be so, based on diagnosis and age at surgery: those with correctable lesions had a lower overall mortality (22 %) than those with uncorrectable lesions (43 %). Where the surgery was performed as an emergency, there was a higher overall and early mortality (55 and 35 respectively), compared to those operations which were performed electively ( 25 and 9 % ) • The presence of other medical conditions, for example congenital abnormalities and infections, was also a determinant of death (44 % mortality if other medical condition present, 26 % if absent). sex, population group, home address and type of surgery performed did not significantly affect mortality when examined by multivariate analysis. Using routine methods of follow up, it was initially thought that 17 % of all patients (22 % of survivors) were lost to follow up. An important determinant of this was the referral centre. 31 % of cases from other major centres and 20 % of foreign cases were lost, as compared to 8 % of cases from smaller towns near Cape Town and 2 % of children from Cape Town. Population group (35 % Blacks, 14 % Coloureds and 7 % Whites were lost), and palliative operation (23 % SPS, and 5 % PAB lost) were also significant determinants. It was possible to trace 12 of the 20 children who were thought to be lost to follow. 8 had died, 3 were still awaiting correction and 1 was traced and received corrective surgery. The records of the children who underwent cardiac surgery in 1987 were also analysed. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of either group, and the early mortality was the same. This study shows that the outcome after palliative cardiac surgery is poor, with a high mortality rate and children often being lost to follow up. The decision to palliate rather than to correct a congenital heart defect must be made after balancing these risks with those of early correction for the particular surgical team. Should palliative surgery be undertaken, careful follow up is essential to ensure that complications of palliation do not set in and that corrective surgery is done at the optimal time.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Optimum time to refurbish a boiler feed pump at Eskom's power stations</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Mortlock, Steven Peter</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Vicatos, George</dc:contributor>
   <dc:description>A key focus area in power generation today is to improve equipment and plant efficiency, with this study specifically aimed to determine the optimum time to refurbish a boiler feed pump by analysing the internal wear of the annular seals. The boiler feed pump (BFP) installed in a power station is either driven by a steam turbine or an electric motor and the BFP is the highest auxiliary power consumer within the power station. In the 13 Eskom generating fossil fired power stations the installed BFPs consume approximately 1000 MWs of auxiliary power continuously. The focus of the study is to understand how the BFPs efficiency changes with time as a result of increased internal clearances and the effect this has on the auxiliary power consumption.

   <dc:title>Development of a multi-stage purification process for serum-derived exosomes and evaluation of their regenerative capacity</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles (30-100 nm) found in tissue culture media and various body fluids that have potential as therapeutics and disease biomarkers. Current literature has reported regenerative benefits for blood-derived exosomes but the majority of these studies purified exosomes using ultracentrifugation (UC), a method that has been found to have high levels of protein contamination. Here the regenerative capacity of exosomes isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a method shown to reduce protein contamination, from human serum was assessed. SEC isolates were found to contain suitably sized vesicles and exosomal markers (CD9, CD81 and TSG101). These isolates allowed for cellular uptake of a range of fluorescent labels and enhanced cellular fibroblast proliferation and endothelial sprout formation in a 3D spheroid-based angiogenesis assay. Further to this, functionality was shown to be retained after incubation of the isolates for 21 days at 37°C. Though a promising indication of regenerative potential, it was found that the isolates contained significant levels of ApoB containing lipoproteins (up to 15 µg ApoB/ml). It was shown that these lipoproteins were predominately the very low and intermediate density lipoproteins. It was found that low-density lipoprotein can impact exosome uptake studies that use fluorescent nucleic acid, protein and lipid dyes. As a substantial extraneous lipoprotein content could also interfere with other downstream applications and analyses such as proteomic analysis, a multistep purification method was developed. A simple 3-step density gradient (DG) UC was introduced prior to SEC that incorporated a high-density iodixanol cushion overlaid by a 18% iodixanol step containing UC concentrated human serum that was then overlaid with 6% iodixanol. This DG relied on flotation to remove lipoproteins. After the multi-step purification (UC DG SEC) ApoB and ApoA1 were not detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting respectively. The UC DG SEC isolates were positive for CD9 and TSG101 and morphologically, as viewed by transmission electron microscopy, had the canonical exosome shape and size. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that though exosome marker levels were similar, there were 100 times more particles in SEC purified isolates relative to those from UC DG SEC, emphasising the extent of lipoprotein removal. Proteomic analysis identified 224 proteins in UC DG SEC isolates relative to the 135 from SEC, with substantial increases in exosome-associated proteins and reductions in lipoproteins. The UC DG SEC exosomes still elicited a significant increase in cell proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts but no increase in endothelial sprout formation. After subcutaneous implantation in a rat model, the highly purified exosomes potentially increased an angiogenic response. In conclusion, we show that serum SEC-derived exosomes with much reduced protein content do have regenerative properties but contain contaminating lipoproteins. Our new isolation technique isolated purer serum exosomes that retained cell proliferation stimulation and potentially enhanced an in vivo angiogenic response. This approach should render the isolated exosomes more suitable for biomarker discovery, molecular composition determination and biological function analysis.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis aims at presenting the perfonnance of turbo codes in the correlated and uncorrelated satellite fading channel. Turbo codes are known to give very good perfonnance results in A WGN channels, especially for very large input message length codes or interleaver sizes. It can be shown that good perfonnance of the turbo codes can be achieved with small interleaver sizes in a satellite channel.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Pneumocystis jirovecii causes fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients and can be fatal if left untreated. The global mortality rate is estimated to be over 200 000 in AIDS patients. In non-AIDS patients there is an estimated mortality rate of 50 000 cases. This rate is increasing in developed countries, attributed to an increase in disorders which require immunotherapy. These include hematologic malignancies, organ transplant, inflammatory disorders and pre-existing lung disease. Immediate immunity is initiated by receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns on the surface of pathogenic fungi. Specifically, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) have been shown to be the principal initiators of innate immune response during fungal infection. Limited studies have focused on the role of CLRs in Pneumocystis infection. Dectin1and Mincle have been shown to recognise Pneumocystis surface antigens with Dectin-1 recognizing β-glucans on the Pneumocystis cell wall leading to an effective immune response. However, the role of a newly described CLR, the Dendritic Cell Immunoactivating Receptor (DCAR) remains undefined. For this reason, we investigated the potential role of this receptor in a mouse model of Pneumocystis murina infection. Wild type and DCAR-deficient C57BL/6 mice were infected with P. murina organisms via intratracheal instillation. Fungal burden was measured in the lung using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. DCAR-deficient mice had a significantly reduced burden compared to wild type mice at Day 7 and 14 post-infection. To identify the immune components involved in pathogen clearance in these mice we measured cellular recruitment and cytokine production at both early (48 hours) and late (7, 14 and 21 days) time points. Flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in alveolar macrophage, dendritic cells, inflammatory monocytes, eosinophils and T cell recruitment to the lung. While ELISA showed increased levels of IL-1β and IFN-γ at 48 hours, and later on in infection IL-1β and IL-12p40 levels were also elevated. Histology analysis determined the localization of the recruited cells, and v interestingly showed an increase in mucus production at day 21 in DCARdeficient mice. In conclusion, we have identified DCAR deficiency as a potential driver of protective immunity in mice during P. murina infection. This may be associated with increased levels of IL-1β in DCAR-deficient mice. Furthermore, DCAR may also be important in adaptive inflammatory response regulation, as DCAR-deficient mice have increased cellular recruitment and mucus production later in infection. The mechanism by which the deletion of this receptor affords these mice the ability to efficiently clear P. murina remains to be determined.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>One of the fundamental tasks in the study of dynamical systems is the discrimination between regular and chaotic behavior. Over the years several methods of chaos detection have been developed. Some of them, such as the construction of the system's Poincar´e Surface of Section, are appropriate for low-dimensional systems. However, an enormous number of real-world problems are described by high-dimensional systems. Thus, modern numerical methods like the Smaller (SALI) and the Generalized (GALI) Alignment Index, which can also be used for lower-dimensional systems, are appropriate for investigating regular and chaotic motion in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we numerically investigate the behavior of the GALIs in the neighborhood of simple stable periodic orbits of the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice model. In particular, we study how the values of the GALIs depend on the width of the stability island and the system's energy. We find that the asymptotic GALI values increase when the studied regular orbits move closer to the edge of the stability island for fixed energy, while these indices decrease as the system's energy increases. We also investigate the dependence of the GALIs on the initial distribution of the coordinates of the deviation vectors used for their computation and the corresponding angles between these vectors. In this case, we show that the final constant values of the GALIs are independent of the choice of the initial deviation vectors needed for their computation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research is a personal reflection and a self-study of two performances that have taken place over the course of two years. My Medium Project titled, When Memories Break, set out to navigate ways of decolonising oppressive dominance and investigating the ramifications of indoctrination in dance. In 2017, during my Honours Degree in Dance Studies at the University of Cape Town, I created a poster-painting with a fellow #FeesMustFall artist-activist. This poster-painting, entitled, Amputation, was introduced at UCT School of Dance' Confluences 9: Deciphering decolonisation in Dance Pedagogy in the 21st Century in Cape Town, South Africa. Since then, Amputation has become a personal credo that I have carried with me in my Practice as Research field of study. In 2018, as part of my Minor Project, I not only highlighted my memories and experiences in Classical Ballet, but also included my memories of other informal1 dance influences. The purpose of this essay is therefore not to depict ballet as a current colonialist art form but rather to draw attention to what it represented during the years of colonialism, apartheid, and the aftermath of that. It is against this background that I explore the issues related to the relationship I have with my dance training to date. As a performer-researcher, I will use my living experience as a case study. This article provides a perspective from a performer-researcher's position using selfreflexivity as a research methodology. My conclusion supports the notion that self-reflection in the quest for decolonisation in dance by performer-researchers is important for the evolution of a more democratic society.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Investigation of the applicability of a cleaner production approach to road side catering in urban Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>In urban Africa, informal street food trade is often accompanied by processing activities, including slaughtering, brewing, grilling or cooking. Food and drinks are often prepared on open fires using wood as a fuel. When wood is used as a fuel, it generally emits smoke containing various pollutants. Previous studies showed that limited capital, lack of education and expression are the main barriers to the implementation of new technologies in the informal sector. It has been argued that the use of cleaner technologies, especially those relevant for the energetic aspect of informal production, would provide affordable net benefits to society in terms of public health, climate change mitigation and food security, but without showing how this could be done in a specific case. This thesis investigated whether a cleaner production approach would be beneficial: economically and for health and safety to roadside vendors in an informal context. The study aimed to provide insights as to whether government could show presence in such settings not only as (unwelcome) regulator, but in a supportive way by introducing cleaner and more efficient means of production, mainly clean-burning technologies in the informal food and drinks preparation. The specific objectives of this thesis were to: ➢ Compare the resource usage and pollution loads associated with traditional vs. cleaner methods of informal roadside food and drink preparation; ➢ Establish whether the cost-savings deriving from increased resource efficiency of cleaner methods would be sufficient motivation for producers to adopt these; ➢ Observe and document other constraints to the adoption of cleaner methods of production by attempting to demonstrate resource efficiency gains and emission reductions possible under real conditions of informal food and drinks production. Two cleaner technologies were considered: efficient wood stoves, which are known to have sizeable benefits in terms of reduced fuel wood usage and smoke emissions (though investigated to date mainly in the context of household energy usage), and anaerobic digestion, which can potentially serve simultaneously as receptacle and treatment for organic wastes, and produce biogas to serve fuel needs. This study combined qualitative and quantitative field observations in a case study setting with experimental work to study the biogas production potential of slaughtering waste. The case study location, Nyanga township in Cape Town, served as a representation of the many urban African settings in which roadside catering occurs. Nyanga township has both formal and informal housing. Its population including many unskilled and unemployed people also makes it a good place for informal activities. One common informal economic activity in Nyanga is the production of cooked meals and drinks. This is done on street corners alongside the road around the transport interchange, where many people pass by and vendors provide various services. The cooked meals include roasted lamb, pork and beef. Live chickens are slaughtered and plucked, and also sold whole for home preparation. An African beer known as umqombothi is locally prepared in two processes, with each process involving approximately two hours of cooking using a 230 L drum. In the field work, it was investigated how much wood was used in open fires compared to efficient wood stoves, specifically for the activity of chicken plucking and umqombothi mashing. The respective fuel costs were calculated and the air quality in the street-side workplace were measured in term of levels of particulate matter less than 10 micron (PM10). It was observed in the field that in most cases sheep and chicken slaughter waste was dumped alongside the road. This dumping was due to the lack of slaughtering facilities in the area. Many other reports have stated that the lack of adequate infrastructure in informal settlements is the cause of inappropriate waste dumping. The qualitative observations confirmed that the meat and other cooked meals were prepared using inefficient methods linked not only to the waste of resources but also to waste of money and exposure to polluted air from burning wood. Air quality measurements showed smoke levels near open fires to be about 8 times higher than when using an efficient wood stove. PM10 levels of 4 900 ±1 500 µg/m3 were measured near chicken pluckers using open fires for their hot water, while when using a stove the PM10 averaged 590 ± 130 µg/m3 . Smoke levels near biogas stoves were measured at 310 ±140 µg/m3 . The stoves used in this study reduced the quantity of wood used for plucked chicken production by a factor of 6. This reflected a reduction in energy otherwise wasted around the pot in the inefficient traditional cooking method. Stove use reduced the solid waste as well as the smoke accordingly. If a stove lasted 3 years, the vendors would save an estimated R33 700 on fuelwood in case they used harvested wood, and if wood waste is used, the fuelwood savings over three years would be R6 300. It was estimated that 100 kg of slaughtering waste dumped every day could generate enough biogas for 7 vendors to be provided with enough thermal energy for their catering trades. Based on the experimental work conducted, it was calculated that a digester of a size of 76 m3 would be needed for this amount of slaughtering waste. The main conclusions of the thesis are: • Cleaner technologies, in the form of efficient wood stoves and biogas reactors and stoves, showed significant saving potential in the informal roadside food and drink production processes investigated in Nyanga, Cape Town. • The wood stoves investigated in this study were suitable for chicken plucking (which use 25 L pots) but not for the mashing stage of umqombothi preparation (which is done in 230 L drums). • The use of these stoves resulted in a 6-fold reduction in wood burned, as well as an 8-fold reduction in particulate air pollution in the workplace. These stoves also offered a very fast payback time (of the order of a few weeks) and significant fuel wood cost savings to caterers. • Biogas stoves were the cleanest of the three methods compared and should be affordable to caterers if a reasonably priced gas supply were available, but the biogas reactor installation represents an infrastructure investment that could not be paid for by the caterers. • A biogas intervention would ensure the reduction of slaughter waste, which is often indiscriminately dumped and thus a significant health hazard. The main recommendations of the study are: • Since wood stoves would offer fast payback times for fuel wood using traders, the local economic development section of local government should aim to stimulate and develop local business to provide such stoves to caterers. • While the slaughter waste can be used as a substrate for biogas generation, for it to become available to the vendors, local government should invest in this as a form of urban infrastructure. • Slaughtering facilities should be built for the vendors where the waste can be kept together and may be used by the municipalities or other bodies. • Similar studies in other developing countries are also encouraged, so as to develop the specific insights on the affordability of achieving benefits to society in terms of public health, climate change mitigation and food security worldwide. Enough time should be allocated for research that combines social interactions in the field with scientific measurements.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Bush encroachment or the thickening of woody vegetation is a phenomenon occurring throughout savannas, which tends to be more pronounced in small protected areas. The consequences of bush encroachment are often negative for the conservation of biodiversity, for the promotion of tourism and the prevention of wildfires. Hence, effective monitoring of woody vegetation and the factors which influence its spread are essential. This is particularly the case for protected areas such as that of Bwabwata National Park (BNP) in north-east Namibia. With a complex land use history and different fire management approaches being adopted throughout the area, the effect of fire on woody vegetation in BNP is currently poorly understood. This study used a 20-year-old repeat photography monitoring project and satellite-based remote sensing products to explore woody cover dynamics in BNP. Results revealed that woody cover has increased by 13% since 1999 in BNP. Furthermore, the results show differences in the structure of woody vegetation. Repeated late dry season fires in the west of the park have driven an increasing dominance of 3m in eastern sections of the park. This influence of different fire regimes spatially across BNP, suggests that local fire management is a significant determinant of woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change differs spatially across BNP due to frequent late dry season fires prevailing in the west and less frequent earlier season fires occurring in the east. Therefore, in order to reduce the mortality of woody species and conserve heterogenous height structure in the west, a reduction of frequent late dry season fires is required. Early dry season fires are shown to reduce the rate of increasing total woody cover change and, therefore, this fire management strategy arguably contributes towards the reduction of wildfire risk, conservation of biodiversity and promotion of tourism.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (NENs) of the Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) are a heterogeneous group of tumours with varied biologic potential and clinical outcomes. They are classified as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (WD NET) or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD NECs) based on morphology. WD NETs are further subtyped (grade 1, 2 or 3) by evaluating the mitotic rate and Ki-67 proliferative index. The most recent grading system was published in 2019 by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a transcription factor that is expressed in neuroendocrine cells, and recent studies have shown that it is a sensitive and specific marker for neuroendocrine differentiation. The aims of this study were to grade NENs of the GIT according to the 2019 WHO grading system, and to evaluate the expression of INSM1 in order to assess its sensitivity and specificity as a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation compared to chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin (SYN). Sixty-nine GIT NENs diagnosed between 2003 and 2017 at Groote Schuur Hospital were included in this study. The mitotic rate and Ki-67 proliferation index were evaluated for each case. We identified 38 grade 1 NETs, 16 grade 2 NETs, 1 grade 3 NET, 13 small cell type NECs and 1 large cell type NEC. INSM1 immunohistochemical staining was performed on all cases. To assess specificity, we evaluated the expression of INSM1 in other GIT primary tumours (adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumour, lymphoma, leiomyoma and Kaposi sarcoma). Eighty percent of our NEN cases stained with INSM1. We found the sensitivity of INSM1 to be higher than CgA (68%), but lower than SYN (87%) and the combined use of CgA-SYN (94%) when considering all NENs. When evaluating only the PD NEC cases, INSM1 had a higher sensitivity than CgA (50%) and SYN (64%), and an equal sensitivity to the combined use of CgA-SYN (79%). We conclude that the high sensitivity and specificity of INSM1 make it a valuable standalone marker for assessing neuroendocrine differentiation. The nuclear reactivity and high sensitivity of INSM1 make it the preferred neuroendocrine marker for PD NEC.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Arthurian mythology in the twentieth century : T.H. White and John Steinbeck's interpretations of Malory's Morte d'Arthur</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Arthurian romances</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This thesis sets out to analyse and evaluate T.H. White's The Once and Future King and John Steinbeck's The Acts of King Arthur and his Noble Knights, two novels based on the Arthurian legend, and to investigate their reliance on Malory's Morte Darthur. A close critical reading of both texts is provided. The thesis begins by setting the novels in the context of the body of twentieth-century literature inspired by the Arthurian legend, and notes that both aspire to provide a fresh interpretation of the Morte Darthur. A broad outline of certain themes in the Morte Darthur which become central concerns in The Once and Future King and The Acts of King Arthur is given. A mythopoetic approach to the Morte Darthur is used, and it is examined as tragic and elegiac mythology in which archetypal characters appear. In the treatment of T.H. White's The Once and Future King, selective use is made of various contextual approaches to literature. In the first volume, The Sword in the Stone, the interaction of the work with the genres of comedy and fantasy is examined, and it is concluded that White makes use of both to create a pastoral idyll. It is suggested that the next three volumes, The Queen of Air and Darkness, The Ill-Made Knight and The Candle in the Wind, demonstrate a progressively ( tragic vision in which the idealism of the first volume is sorely tried by the relentlessness of fate, and the machinations of human beings. It is indicated that White creates his most successful balance between romantic idealism and pessimistic realism in The Ill-Made Knight. It is also argued that The Candle in the Wind fails to maintain the intensity of Malory's tragedy and that The Book of Merlyn, the author's alternative ending to the saga, provides a more fitting ending to the entire cycle, although marred by White's bitterness and polemic argument. John Steinbeck's The Acts of King Arthur and his Noble Knights is examined in the light of the author's original aims to translate the Morte Darthur. It is suggested that the first chapters in which he does this are flat and sometimes laboured in comparison with the original, but that his last two sections, Gawain, Ewain and Marhalt and The Noble Tale of Sir Lancelot, provide a fresh and inventive approach. It is argued that in The Noble Tale of Sir Lancelot, Steinbeck comes to grips with the drama at the heart of the Morte Darthur as he introduces the eternal triangle in which the central characters are situated, and explores the potential for failure, even chaos, within the Round Table itself. The thesis concludes by drawing parallels between the two works and comparing their respective merits. It is maintained that while Malory's Morte Darthur cannot be improved upon, it is transmuted in the hands of White and Steinbeck into rich, lively and thought-provoking novels.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study investigates language variation in the Transkei Xhosa speech community, focusing on the different dialects spoken in this geographical area and their impact on the education of children. As the study focuses on children's education, it is hypothesized that there is a possible correlation between the dialect spoken and the student's academic achievement and life's chances. It is the sociolinguistic view-point that there exists an intimate relationship between the relative status of a speaker's language and his socio-political status. The Transkeian Xhosa speech community comprises various tribes with different speech patterns (i.e. Gcaleka, Bomvana, Tembu, Cele, Ntlangwini, Baca, Hlubi, Mpondo, Xesibe). In the educational context some of these speech forms are labelled as dialectal or as deviations from the norm and therefore stigmatised. This implies that children enter the school setting as winners or losers depending on the dialect or variant they speak.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>13C/12C and 15N/14N were used to indicate the trophic levels of the shallow-water Cape hake, Merluccius capensis (Castelnau) at three sites on the west coast of South Africa, and five sites on the south coast. Gut content analyses show only the very recent diet of hake, therefore stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were used to show the longer-term diet, integrated over the turnover time of the muscle tissue and bone collagen analysed. 13C/12C is 1-2%₀ higher in the tissues of a consumer than its diet (DeNiro and Epstein 1978), the difference in 15N/14N between a consumer and its food being 3-4%₀ (DeNiro and Epstein 1981). Both 13C/12C and 15N/14N indicate trophic enrichment between hake muscle tissue and bone collagen, and the gut contents and prey, and show that small and large hake feed at different trophic levels, large hake tissues being slightly heavier in 13C than small hake tissues, and containing 2-4%₀ more 15N than muscle tissue and bone collagen, and the gut contents and prey, and show that small and large hake feed at different trophic levels, large hake tissues being slightly heavier in 13C than small hake tissues, and containing 2-4%₀ and more 15N than muscle tissue and bone collagen of small hake.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A phantom based evaluation on the effects of patient breathing motion on Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy treatment volumes</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Medicine</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Aim: The aim of the study was to design an upper body phantom to mimic the movement of the lesion inside the lungs during a breathing cycle. Phantom design included an assessment of the motion observed for lung lesions, identification of suitable phantom materials as well as design of a motorized arm to mimic the movements observed inside the lung area of the phantom. Introduction: Expansion margins are added to clinical target volumes contoured by Oncologists in order to safeguard against under- or over-treatment of the target volume. They are designed to account for errors during setup, inaccuracies on the linear accelerator, and movement of targets inside the patient. If the margins are too small, there is a risk that the lesion/target may not receive the necessary dose, due to being partially missed. On the other hand, if the margins are too wide, the lesion will be covered, but normal tissue may receive unnecessary dose, resulting in additional side effects to the patient. Assessment of the impact of these margins is not possible in a static phantom and the availability of a low-cost motorized phantom would assist in the validation of these margins. Method: Previously treated patients' 4D CT scanning data were used to quantify the amount of movement seen for lesions within the lung. A phantom was then designed and built in an attempt to mimic both patient anatomy and movement. Materials were identified to replicate anatomical shape and densities of various organs in the thorax, as seen on CT scan data. Two treatment planning systems (Monaco, (Elekta) and Eclipse (Varian)) were used to determine the dosimetric characteristics of the materials. This was compared to actual dose as delivered by a linear accelerator (Elekta Synergy). Results: Paths were calculated from the breathing cycles during the 4D-CT scan sets and templates designed to mimic these movements. A thorax phantom was built with the appropriate materials suitable and matched densities to replicate a human thorax. Comparing transmission for these materials on a linear accelerator for 6MV and 10MV energy, the deviation from planned versus measured dose varied between 1.67% to 3.32% and 0.45% to 2.30%, respectively for the silicon material and between 0.77% to 3.22% and 0.17% to 2.57% for the 3D printed bone for 6MV and 10MV. iv Conclusion: The measurements done on the linear accelerator matched closely with the calculated values on the treatment planning system for transmission through the materials in the customised phantom. Various proposals were put forward to mimic the movement of the targets within the lung regions. However, it was not possible to manufacture a mechanically based working model due to the small movements observed (&lt;5mm). It is recommended that a robotic solution be investigated as alternative to mimic these small movements.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The Genetic and Endoscopic Surveillance Clinic provides predictive testing and life-saving colorectal cancer screening services to individuals with Lynch syndrome in the Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa. The risk of colorectal cancer is reduced by 50% and mortality is decreased by 65% with regular colonoscopic screening; however, the attendance rate at the clinic has been declining over several years. Concerns exist for those individuals undergoing screening at levels below the desired recommendations. It was thus opportune for a formal evaluation of both the surveillance and predictive testing programmes to be conducted to determine factors affecting the access, utilisation and satisfaction with the service, from the perspective of the service users.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>soccer injury</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>Rwanda</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Background: There is growing participation in soccer at all levels of sport. Soccer increases the physical and psychological demands on players, which subsequently increase the risk of injuries. There are limited prospective epidemiological studies in Africa, and studies that have been conducted to date often fail to incorporate standardised injury definitions or reporting methods. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct epidemiological studies within the context of low to middle-income countries, where resources may be limited, and taking into consideration exposure times to design appropriate preventive measures. Aim: The purpose of the study was to explore the nature and incidence of soccer-related injuries in first division players in Rwanda, and to establish intrinsic risk factors for injuries. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted for two seasons. Eleven teams (326 players) and 13 teams (391 players) were followed for the seasons 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. Anthropometric and musculoskeletal screening composed of flexibility tests, strength and endurance, balance and proprioception tests, and lower limb function tests were conducted as well as training and match exposure were recorded. Team medical personnel recorded the location, type, duration and mechanism of time-loss injuries following the suggestion of the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA). The primary outcome was the incidence of overall, training and match injury as well as body part, type, patterns and severity of injuries. Multivariate model using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) was used to assess intrinsic predictors of injury. Significance was accepted as p&lt;0.05. Results: There were 455 injuries and approximately 46% of the players were injured in each of the two seasons. The team weighted mean incidence of match injuries was significantly lower during season one (14.2 injuries/ 1000 hours) compared to season two (21.9 injuries/ 1000 hours) (t(22)= -2.092, p=0.048). No difference was observed in the team-weighted incidence for overall and training injuries between the two seasons. There was increased injury incidence with increased acute: chronic training and match workload ratios. Lower extremities were the most frequently affected over the two seasons (80% of all injuries), with the knee joint most commonly injured (28% off all injuries) followed by the ankle joint (25% of all injuries). Ligament strains were the most common form of injury followed by muscle strains and contusions. The most common mechanisms of injury were collisions between players and receiving a tackle. About three quarters of the reported injuries were mild or moderate in severity and injuries to the Achilles tendon lead to the longest median lay-off time. The greatest incidence of injuries was sustained between the 46thand 60thminute of match play. A score of 11cm or less on the Sit and Reach test, more than one year in the current club and a timed hop of more than 2.5 seconds were all associated with injury. Conclusions: The rate of injuries found in this study is lower compared to the studies that reported injuries in adult male at either professional or amateur level. The patterns of training and match injuries, location, type and severity of injuries are similar to previous studies. Flexibility and balance, and coordination emerged as being significant predictors of increased risk of injury. More studies with emphasis on intrinsic and extrinsic factors are needed to attain wider knowledge concerning injuries among soccer players in Africa. Prevention intervention is necessary to minimise the of lower limb injuries.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Includes bibliographical references.</dc:description>
   <dc:description>Patients that have undergone a laryngectomy lose the normal heat-moisture-exchange functions of the nose and upper airways. Breathing unconditioned air can cause irritation of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa and lead to chest complaints such as irritating coughing and excessive mucus production and mucus plugs. Disposable HME's that cover the tracheostoma and are stuck to the skin with adhesives are believed to improve the condition of inspired air for laryngectomy patients. HME's work by accumulating heat and moisture during exhalation and reciprocally warming and humidifying in spired air. Due to the cost of HMEs they are not affordable to the general population in South Africa and many other countries. Stoma Covers are simple devices made of a single fabric or combinations of fabrics that are fastened around the neck with the cloth covering the tracheostoma. They are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and can be washed and re-used. No research has been conducted to date regarding the effect of using simple Stoma Covers to improve the tracheal climate in laryngectomy patients.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In the synthesis of zeolites optimization of factors such as crystallinity, which encapsulates morphology, and acidity can result in optimal activity. Optimal activity is vital in chemical industries due to the fact that it results in higher yields, better selectivities and lower operational costs. In this project the effect of crystallinity on activity is investigated to get a better understanding of performance in terms of activity of amorphous, partially crystalline and highly crystalline materials using isomerisation of para-xylene as the probe reaction.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>I have produced a series of sculpted cast figures in the medium of cowhide as part of my Masters degree. This document, titled Locating Me in Order to See You, serves as an explication of the practical component. Initially I examine the broad context in which my sculpture has been produced, and that in which it will be presented and likely to be received. In attempting to position myself within Contemporary Art discourse, I have specifically considered how Contemporary Art from Africa is often read and comprehended by both those producing work on the continent and the Diaspora, and those interpreting, critiquing, collecting and marketing it, mainly in the West. The basic premise for this is a discussion of the inescapable labels of Black Artist and Black Art and what they imply within the context of Contemporary Art discourse with reference to Africa and more specifically, South Africa. As an emerging Contemporary African Artist I am faced with confronting some of the stereotypes and assumptions associated with art and artists of the continent and! or the legacy of the Apartheid regime.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The mechanical properties of biological tissues are of increasing research interest to disciplines as varied as designers of protective equipment, medical researchers and even forensic Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The mechanical properties of biological tissue such as skin are relatively well known at low strain rates and strains, but there is a paucity of data on the high rate, high strain behaviour of skin - particularly under biaxial tension. Biaxial tensile loading mimics in vivo conditions more closely than uniaxial loading [1, 2], and is necessary in order to characterise a hyper-elastic material model[3]. Furthermore, biaxial loading allows one to detect the anisotropy of the sample without introducing noise from inter-sample variability - unlike uniaxial tensile testing. This work develops a high strain rate bulge test device capable of testing soft tissue or polymer membranes at high strain rates. The load history as well as the full field displacement data is captured via a pressure transducer and high speed 3D Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Strain rates ranging from 0.26s −1 to 827s −1 are reliably achieved and measured. Higher strain rates of up to 2500s −1 are achieved, but are poorly measured due to equipment limitations of the high speed cameras used. The strain rates achieved had some variability, but were significantly more consistent than those achieved by high rate biaxial tension tests found in the literature. In addition to control of the apex strain rate, the bi-axial strain ratio is controlled via the geometry of the specimen fixture. This allowed for strain ratios of up to 2 to be achieved at the apex 1 . When testing anisotropic membranes, the use of full field 3D DIC allowed for accurate and efficient detection of the principal axis of anisotropy in the material. No skin is tested, but instead three types of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, ”silicone') skin simulant are tested. These simulants were chosen to fully encapsulate the range of mechanical behaviour expected from skin - they were chosen to have stiffness's, strain hardening exponents and degrees of anisotropy significantly above or below the behaviour exhibited by skin. This ensured that the device was validated over a wider range of conditions than expected when testing skin. A novel approach to specimen fixation and speckling for silicone membranes is developed, as well as a fibre reinforced skin simulant that closely mimics the rate hardening and anisotropic behaviour of skin. In addition to bulge tests, uniaxial tensile tests are conducted on the various simulant materials in order to characterise their low strain rate behaviour. The composite skin simulant is characterised using a modified version of the anisotropic skin model developed by Weiss et al (1996) [4], and the pure silicone membranes are characterised using the Ogden hyper-elastic model.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study deals with a systematic description of student production of mathematics texts and focused on written texts that appeared to be legitimate yet could not be upheld by a principled verbal description. A search of the literature on the analysis of students texts revealed that semiotic analysis, was not only scarce, but ideally suited to examining the social organisation of school mathematics practice. This study examines how student texts produced in response to typical school mathematics problems can, via a systematic analysis of texts, index the construction of mathematics knowledge.  It outlines Dowlings' model of Social Activity Theory (1998) to produce a textual analysis which focuses on textual strategies to distribute message. These strategies and the message underpin the analysis. Practices that establish the message distributed indexes mathematics knowledge and curriculum practices. The notion of a mathematising gaze informing school practice was explored and was related to the construction of existing and pre-existing mathematics knowledge. To locate the effects of a mathematics gaze that could produce texts that lacked discursive elaboration in verbal discriptions, a comprehensive list of ideal types were developed to act as an interface between the empirical text produced that acted as a reading for constructive description of the theoretical terrain.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A comparative study between the cubic spline and b-spline interpolation methods in free energy calculations</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Numerical methods are essential in computational science, as analytic calculations for large datasets are impractical. Using numerical methods, one can approximate the problem to solve it with basic arithmetic operations. Interpolation is a commonly-used method, inter alia, constructing the value of new data points within an interval of known data points. Furthermore, polynomial interpolation with a sufficiently high degree can make the data set differentiable. One consequence of using high-degree polynomials is the oscillatory behaviour towards the endpoints, also known as Runge's Phenomenon. Spline interpolation overcomes this obstacle by connecting the data points in a piecewise fashion. However, its complex formulation requires nested iterations in higher dimensions, which is time-consuming. In addition, the calculations have to be repeated for computing each partial derivative at the data point, leading to further slowdown. The B-spline interpolation is an alternative representation of the cubic spline method, where a spline interpolation at a point could be expressed as the linear combination of piecewise basis functions. It was proposed that implementing this new formulation can accelerate many scientific computing operations involving interpolation. Nevertheless, there is a lack of detailed comparison to back up this hypothesis, especially when it comes to computing the partial derivatives. Among many scientific research fields, free energy calculations particularly stand out for their use of interpolation methods. Numerical interpolation was implemented in free energy methods for many purposes, from calculating intermediate energy states to deriving forces from free energy surfaces. The results of these calculations can provide insight into reaction mechanisms and their thermodynamic properties. The free energy methods include biased flat histogram methods, which are especially promising due to their ability to accurately construct free energy profiles at the rarely-visited regions of reaction spaces. Free Energies from Adaptive Reaction Coordinates (FEARCF) that was developed by Professor Kevin J. Naidoo has many advantages over the other flat histogram methods. iii Because of its treatment of the atoms in reactions, FEARCF makes it easier to apply interpolation methods. It implements cubic spline interpolation to derive biasing forces from the free energy surface, driving the reaction towards regions with higher energy. A major drawback of the method is the slowdown experienced in higher dimensions due to the complicated nature of the cubic spline routine. If the routine is replaced by a more straightforward B-spline interpolation, sampling and generating free energy surfaces can be accelerated. The dissertation aims to perform a comparative study between the cubic spline interpolation and B-spline interpolation methods. At first, data sets of analytic functions were used instead of numerical data to compare the accuracy and compute the percentage errors of both methods by taking the functions themselves as reference. These functions were used to evaluate the performances of the two methods at the endpoints, inflections points and regions with a steep gradient. Both interpolation methods generated identically approximated values with a percentage error below the threshold of 1%, although they both performed poorly at the endpoints and the points of inflection. Increasing the number of interpolation knots reduced the errors, however, it caused overfitting in the other regions. Although significant speed-up was not observed in the univariate interpolation, cubic spline suffered from a drastic slowdown in higher dimensions with up to 103 in 3D and 105 in 4D interpolations. The same results applied to the classical molecular dynamics simulations with FEARCF with a speed-up of up to 103 when B-spline interpolation was implemented. To conclude, the B-spline interpolation method can enhance the efficiency of the free energy calculations where cubic spline interpolation has been the currently-used method.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A Historical Institutionalist Analysis of the Evolution of South Africa's Municipal Electricity Sector within the Broader Electricity Supply Industry</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>local government functions and legitimacy</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>new institutionalism</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>historical institutionalism</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This study has been partly inspired by the fact that historical narratives on the evolution of the South African Electricity Supply Industry (ESI), have for the most part focused on the national vertically integrated utility, Eskom; with far less attention being paid to the role that the municipal electricity undertakings (MEU's) have, and continue to, play. Indeed, this is somewhat surprising if one considers that MEU's began operating more than 20 years before Eskom's 1923 formation; and perhaps this lack of focus on MEU's is compounded by Eskom's operational crisis from 2006 (threatening its ongoing viability), which has overshadowed the perilous situation that MEU's have found themselves in. The research thus has two objectives. The first is to provide a detailed historical account of the role of MEU's and their contribution to the country's ESI from their genesis; while demonstrating the linkages between Eskom, MEU's and the three tiers of government. The second then examines how from the formation of the Union (1910), two fundamental but diametrically opposing objectives continue to prevail: 1) An over-burdened, financially ‘self-sufficient', local government, whose limited scope to collect revenue means electricity surpluses must be maximised to cross-subsidise its operations; and, 2) A vertically integrated utility, mandated to generate electricity at the lowest unit price, so as to provide the energy intensive economy with a competitive advantage. These contradictions, which have endured for many decades, reached fever pitch in the last 20 years, contributing significantly to the demise of ESI reforms initiated in 2000 and abandoned in 2010. Simultaneously, they have worsened the crisis of local government, which is constitutionally mandated to deliver basic services to its constituents, whose failure to do so, in many instances now threatens national government legitimacy at the most fundamental level. Within this context, the research, (based on the premise that history and institutions matter), employs the theoretical framework of new institutionalism, as applied through the lens of historical institutionalism (HI). Here, application of HI's core tenets revolves around identifying and explaining the critical junctures which create path dependency and institutional lock-in, while also accounting for incremental change which undoubtedly exists over a 120-year period. However, the unjust social and economic history of the country, where political decisions (pre and post-apartheid) have had a disproportional impact on state entities, requires closer scrutiny. For this, a detailed conceptual framework is employed to disentangle the complex relationship that has developed between the three tiers of government and their respective interacting powers. Ultimately, in delivering a detailed historiography of municipal electricity supply, the research posits that the ESI requires deeper fundamental reform than envisaged in 2000; and that most importantly, this must take cognisance of the extent to which MEU's are embedded within local government. This, the research believes, will increase the likelihood of local government participation and acceptance; perhaps pointing to an as yet unexplored path forward out of the South African ESI's current quandary.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Urban Infrastructure Design and Management</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Since 1994 the post-apartheid South African Government has recognized the importance of housing in improving the quality of life of its citizens. Following 10 years of a housing delivery model that saw the provision of nearly 1.6 million houses, the National Government introduced a new policy that sought to shift away from an emphasis on housing and rather a holistic focus on the quality of the settlement established. This new policy, Breaking New Ground (BNG) promoted the establishment of well-managed, liveable and equitable settlements incorporating social and economic infrastructure. The quality of the urban environment and the quality of public spaces within urban developments has been identified as contributing towards improving quality of life within these settlements. In mixedincome, integrated settlements - like those BNG claims to produce - the importance of public space is further emphasised because it compensates for limited space of the private home. However, these spaces are often considered as &quot;nice-to-haves&quot; and neglected in favour of basic services or housing. Despite the importance of public space and its contribution to the creation of sustainable human settlements, these spaces, although planned for in the initial phases of a development, still remain largely undeveloped. This research therefore questions whether public spaces within integrated housing developments are being used as intended. It also questions to what extent the necessity for increased urban densification has affected the provision of public space in integrated housing developments. This research attempts to answer the question from the perspective of professionals involved in the planning and implementation of integrated housing developments and not from the perspective of residents. A qualitative research approach has been adopted. Three settlements each representing an integrated housing development implemented in line with BNG principles and incorporating public spaces were selected as case studies and in-depth interviews with professionals involved in the planning and implementation of these developments were conducted. The research found that while public spaces are considered as beneficial and are included in the planning stages of a development, in reality the lived experience often differs. While the objectives of housing policies are to create sustainable human settlements, professionals still struggle to translate these objectives into practical guidelines and standards. Finally, it was observed that while public spaces do play a role in the shift from housing to human settlements, the process is one that occurs incrementally and over a period of time.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Current top-down city planning strategies implement abstract ideas and impose them on a society while neglecting a crucial sense of public voice and inclusion (Krause, 2011). Through exploring ideas of community ownership of space and flexibility of social inhabitation, the design dissertation aims to understand the minimum built form that generates the greatest urban impact through architecture of closed-loop material systems. The inquiry focuses on urban upgrade that is low in embodied energy and holistic in its processes and implementation, where the social side of community participation is overlapped with technical explorations of material re-use and local procurement that promotes inclusive architecture. The use of low-tech materials requires high amounts of labour, which generates a positive state of community buy-in and inclusion both qualitatively (dignity and ownership) and qualitatively (Job creation). The design dissertation demonstrates how a relatively small building can make massive improvements in activation of site and precinct, being catalytic with community participation and urban upgrade of a rich, authentic nature. The aspiration of this design research is to generate a speculative design framework and set of experimental design details that are useful to local municipalities, planners, urban designers, architects and NGO's that are interested in developing sustainable models for upgrade in under-resourced neighbourhoods of the Cape Town townships. With enough planning and unique tailoring of the building contract, procurement, project management and community involvement, these new typologies can offer more integrity than current and conventional builds. Unique teams require brave and unconventional practices that step out of the rigid comfort zone architects call the industry.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Fan Capacity Limitations</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>In South Africa, nearly 80 % of electricity is generated from coal fired power plants. Due to the complexity of the interconnected systems that make up a typical power plant, analysis of the root causes of load losses is not a straightforward process. This often leads to losses incorrectly being ascribed to the Induced Draught (ID) fan, where detection occurs, while the problem actually originates elsewhere in the plant. The focus of this study was to develop and demonstrate a modelling methodology to quantify the effects of major plant anomalies on the capacity of ID fans in coal fired power plants. The ensuing model calculates the operating point of the ID fan that is a result of anomalies experienced elsewhere in the plant. This model can be applied in conjunction with performance test data as part of a root cause analysis procedure. The model has three main sections that are integrated to determine the ID fan operating point. The first section is a water/steam cycle model that was pre-configured in VirtualPlantTM. The steam plant model was verified via energy balance calculations and validated against original heat balance diagrams. The second is a draught group model developed using FlownexSETM. This onedimensional network is a simplification of the flue gas side of the five main draught group components, from the furnace inlet to the chimney exit, characterising only the aggregate heat transfer and pressure loss in the system. The designated ID fan model is based on the original fan performance curves. The third section is a Boiler Mass and Energy Balance (BMEB) specifically created for this purpose to: (1) translate the VirtualPlant results for the steam cycle into applicable boundary conditions for the Flownex draught group model; and (2) to calculate the fluid properties applicable to the draught group based on the coal characteristics and combustion process. The integrated modelling methodology was applied to a 600 MW class coal fired power plant to investigate the impact of six major anomalies that are typically encountered. These are: changes in coal quality; increased boiler flue gas exit temperatures; air ingress into the boiler; air heater inleakage to the flue gas stream; feed water heaters out-of-service; and condenser backpressure degradation. It was inter alia found that a low calorific value (CV) coal of 14 MJ/kg compared to a typical 17 MJ/kg reduced the fan's capacity by 2.1 %. Also, having both HP FWH out of service decreased the fan's capacity by 16.2 %.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>An analysis of the possible fiscal consequences of a controlled foreign company being declared resident in South Africa– may SARS have its cake and eat it?</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Tax Law</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The issue considered in this paper proceeds from the basis of a hypothetical income tax assessment issued by SARS against a hypothetical taxpayer. The circumstances under which the hypothetical assessment is raised are as follows: suppose that Company A, a South African resident, owns 100% of the participation rights in Company B (the hypothetical taxpayer), a resident of Luxembourg. Company A has failed to qualify for any of the internal “exemptions”1 contained in section 9D of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962 (“the Act”), and has thus been taxed with reference to the profits of Company B for the past ten years. In the eleventh year, SARS audits Company B and determines that its effective place of management has, in fact, been in South Africa all along and that it is therefore resident in South Africa in terms of paragraph (b) of the definition of “resident” contained in section 1 of the Act. Upon the determination that Company B is resident in South Africa, SARS proceeds to raise assessments against Company B in relation to the taxable income it earned during its current and former years of assessment (i.e. income tax assessments are raised for the full 11-year audit period) (referred to herein below as the “hypothetical assessment”). The purpose of this paper is thus to investigate the fiscal consequences that do (and, it will be argued, do not) arise subsequent to a controlled foreign company (“CFC”) having been declared resident of the Republic of South Africa, in circumstances where a South African resident taxpayer had historically been taxed with reference to the profits of that CFC in terms of section 9D. It is clear from the example that the same income now being taxed in the hands of Company B subsequent to its South African residency would already have been taxed in the hands of Company A by application of section 9D. The inequity of this result is undeniable. Should assessments be raised against Company B in the manner suggested it would amount to economic double taxation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis seeks to understand the role of school timetables as an interface between policies that regulate or distribute forms of capital to schools, and their teaching and learning rhythms. By doing so, it proposes a mechanism for examining the reproduction of schooling practices, and how these are grounded in policy-regulated materiality. Two high schools with similar historic backgrounds, and operating under the same provincial government, were selected and closely studied for evidence of rhythms of practice and the correspondence of these rhythms to each school's timetable. The two schools now experience different access to resources, and have significant differences in teaching and learning rhythms, as well as school-leaving summative assessment results. The study develops an analytic framework for identifying policies that reach into schools through the timetable. Five key inputs are identified as necessary for constructing timetables, providing productive lines of inquiry as to which policies affect schooling rhythms and how. By asking who teaches whom, what, with what and where, systematic analysis is conducted on: how schools are staffed (who); who they enrol (whom); their interpretation of curriculum (what); what supplementary resources they can command (with what); and their infrastructural facilities and geographic (dis)advantages (where). The interaction between these different threads is examined as they tangle within each school's timetable. The enactment of the policies regulating each thread is then traced through the layers of governance of the South African education system: national, provincial and local (school-level). Timetables are conceptualised in this study as local representations of intended teaching and learning rhythm. Using Lefebvre's triad of timespace-conceived, timespace-perceived and timespace-lived, timetables (timespace-conceived) are brought into conversation with timespace-lived through daily teaching and learning activities. Bourdieu's theory of practice is used with Lefebvre to animate the ‘game' of schooling: what schools strive for, what forms of capital they can command to sustain or improve their field position, and how they reproduce their practices. Bourdieu and Lefebvre together generate a sociomaterial practice theory lens that foregrounds timetables and their legitimacy to govern rhythms of teaching and learning in timespace. Timetables emerge as a site of the production and reproduction of advantage (fortified schools) and/or disadvantage (exposed schools) in the game of schooling. In timetables, the policies that avail forms of capital interact in previously unconsidered ways, suggesting that collectively they potentially undergird inequality in the education system.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 contains favourable concessions applicable to taxpayers who derive income from the carrying on of farming operations. Taxpayers who carry on processes of manufacture may also expect favourable fiscal treatment, albeit to a lesser extent. The most relevant concessions applicable to the aforementioned distinct classes of taxpayers are discussed, and where applicable, reference is made to judicial commentaries and the literature as regards potential interpretational difficulties. Accordingly, it is submitted that the first mentioned class of taxpayers above receive more extensive concessions with more favourable results than the latter.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Prior to 2020, the South African economy was facing major socio-economic challenges, struggling to eliminate poverty and reduce persistent inequality. The COVID crisis has deepened the financial crisis, with the last major agency putting the country’s rating below investment grade, or ‘junk status’. The recovery plan starts with rescue. The climate crisis is longer-term but still needs as urgent action as ever. The country is preparing to enhance its nationally determined contribution in an unprecedented context. Decarbonisation of the electricity sector is a priority – but in the SA context requires careful attention to communities and workers dependent on coal. The just transition transaction (JTT) is being developed in technical detail since 2019 by Meridian Economics (2020) and making the financial deal is work in progress. In brief, the transaction mobilises blended finance to fund the accelerated phase out of coal, thereby accelerating a transition from coal to renewable energy, and a portion of the concessional funds flows into Just Transition fund. This case study reflects on the JTT, seeking to understand its architecture, the potential to catalyse changes in the complex set of challenges in the electricity sector, by funding accelerated phase-out of coal and a just transition in South Africa, with broader implications for international climate finance. The time-scale of developing the transaction is fluid, while implementation of decommissioning would take many years. The purpose of the study is to understand the potential of a just transition transaction to accelerate the phase out of coal-fired power and to fund development projects. The purpose requires a specific focus, and it is important to understand what is included in the scope of this case study, and what lies beyond that scope.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>It is widely understood that the transport properties of marine concretes affect their potential durability in their service environment. The critical deterioration effect on such concretes is corrosion of embedded steel promoted by chloride ion ingress into the concrete. The occurrence of such deterioration and the rate at which it occurs depends on the quality of concrete, the aggressiveness of the particular marine environment and the coupling between the two. This dissertation presents the results of an experimental study done to compare different South African marine concrete making materials sourced from Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban. The materials are typically specified for reinforced concrete structures in these urban marine regions.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The thoughts and opinions of advanced life support providers in the South African private emergency medical services sector concerning pre-hospital palliative care</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Emergency Medicine</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines palliative care as 'an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.' 1 This includes a wide variety of situations such as chronic illness and end-of-life care. 2 Palliative care is usually performed in-hospital. However, emergency medical services (EMS) often encounter patients requiring palliative care as these patients may have acute exacerbations of illness, progress towards end-of-life or require transport to a medical facility. 3-9 Thus, there is a role for palliative care in the pre-hospital setting. EMS providers are uniquely positioned to deliver this care in the pre-hospital setting as they are often the first point of medical contact. 10 This has great potential benefit for patient comfort, early identification and relief of suffering and earlier referral to hospice care. 10, 11 Despite this unique position there is an overall lack of guidance within EMS systems to manage palliative patients. 5, 6, 10 In the United States of America (USA), for example, only 5-6% of EMS systems have protocols for palliative care. 6, 10 In addition, there is no specific pre-hospital emergency care curricula on the subject, resulting in a lack of education and training for EMS providers. 3-5, 12, 13 This may stem from the historical focus of EMS training which primarily involves immediate measures to preserve life or limb until definitive care is reached. 11 This focus has resulted in an EMS ethos of 'saving lives.' 5, 12 Palliative care, on the other hand, is not focussed on 'saving lives', but rather the prevention and relief of suffering. 1 Therefore, palliative care may seem to conflict with emergency care, placing EMS providers in difficult situations when confronted with palliative care patients. 8, 12, 14 South Africa itself faces what has been termed a “quadruple burden of disease” due to communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, high maternal and paediatric mortality rates, non-communicable disease as well as injury. 15 The large number of patients suffering from these diseases and the life-limiting complications thereof, results in increased need for palliative care in the country as noted by the South African Minister of Health. 16 Access to health care for patients suffering from these diseases is a further challenge in the Sub-Saharan African setting. 17, 18, 19 In South Africa, EMS are often contacted 3 by those without access to transport to provide this service. 20 Thus, South African EMS providers may frequently encounter not only high acuity emergency patients, but many ill HIV/AIDS, cancer and other chronically ill patients requiring palliative care who are unable to access healthcare via alternative means. 21 European studies have found that approximately 3-5% of all pre-hospital calls involve palliative care situations. 2, 22, 23 With the quadruple burden of disease and limited access in the South African setting, this percentage is likely higher as these factors result in increased frequency of contact between EMS providers and patients requiring palliative care. Although EMS providers in South Africa manage palliative patients in the prehospital setting, to our knowledge, no research has been produced in the (South) African setting regarding prehospital palliative care. Outside of Africa literature has been produced but is limited. This literature review discusses paramedic perceptions of prehospital palliative care, prehospital palliative care patient management and legislation concerning prehospital palliative care. Finally, expert opinion pieces and recommendations are reviewed.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis represents an instance of my engagement as a reflective practitioner to explore how access opportunities into a web design Discourse can be enhanced. The study is located in the Multimedia Skills subject which is part of the Certificate in Multimedia Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. In describing student entry into a web design environment, insights into academic literacy practices within the multimedia and web design environment are provided. The theoretical concepts of Discourse, interest, intertextuality, literacy, acquisition and learning are used to ground the conceptual framework of the study, while an interpretative case study is utilized as research methodology. Using the notion of recontextualisation, how the professional Discourse of web design was appropriate into the curriculum of the Multimedia Skills subject and the Multimedia Technology programme is described. This analysis identifies a core identity distinction between web designers (who have a strong visual focus) and web developers (who foreground technical competencies) which is supported by the subject focus in the programme. The research considers two key data sources, personal websites and semi-structured interviews. These account for student performances in and meta-knowledge of the web design Discourse and reveal evidence of how Discourses were reflected in student design decision-making in their personal websites. The differential experiences of student access to the web design Discourse prompt the consideration of how learning and acquisition activities could be used in the classroom to facilitate more balanced performance and meta-knowledge expression.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The purpose of this study is to explore teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) as a professional organization and trade union championing the interest of teachers. The premise from which the work begins is that KNUT as an interest group organization is guided in its role by the needs, desires and aspirations of teachers, both as individuals and members of the teaching profession. In this regard, its effectiveness (in terms of meeting or fulfilling its goals) is therefore central to the maintenance of its legitimacy among the teaching corps. The study uses questionnaires and interview schedules to collect data from primary and secondary teachers located in the rural and urban regions of Nakuru and Kisumu districts in Kenya. The questionnaire survey consisted of a rating scale, which sought the opinion of teachers on the union's performance in a range of items in the two domains of its professional and socio-economic roles. In all, 224 teachers responded to the questionnaire survey. Using descriptive and relational statistics, the quantitative data from the questionnaire survey were analyzed using the STATA software package to establish the general and specific opinions of teachers on the effectiveness of the union in its various roles. This was then followed by an in-depth unstructured but guided interview, which focused on 14 teachers. The qualitative mode of investigation aimed at complementing the questionnaire data by establishing the underlying reasons for teachers' perceptions of the union's effectiveness. The findings of this work show that on the whole, teachers viewed the union favourably in its role as a trade union organization, but distinctly less so as a professional body. Whereas teachers acknowledged that the union has been effective in ‘pushing' for the improvement of most of their welfare or socio-economic needs, its role as a professional organization was seen to be ‘wanting.' To a large extent, the failure of the union in most of its roles in professional domain was attributed to the structural/institutional factors that are in place and which limit its inﬂuence.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Medical consequences in endurance sports - Two Oceans Marathon longitudinal study :  an evaluation of participation guidelines in  runners presenting with symptoms of acute illness before competition</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: One of the most common clinical decisions a Sports and Exercise Medicine (SEM) physician is required to make is whether an athlete presenting with symptoms or signs of an acute illness can participate in exercise training or competition. Currently, a clinical tool, known as the ‘neck check’ is used to determine eligibility to participate in exercise training or competition athletes with acute illness. This original clinical tool, first described about 20 years ago, was based mainly on an abbreviated medical history and findings of a clinical examination were excluded. Symptoms of illness ‘above-the-neck’ e.g.sneezing, rhinorrhoea or sinus congestion constitute a ‘passed’ “neck check”, whereas ‘below-the-neck’ symptoms e.g.cough and/or systemic symptoms such as fever and myalgia, constitute a ‘failed’ “neck check”. However, in the current literature, there remain very few data regarding 1) the adherence of athletes to advice given following a ‘neck check’, and 2) whether the exercise performance (e.g.the ability to finish a race) or the development of medical complications during exercise is different in athletes who “passed” or “failed” the ‘neck check’. Objective The main objectives of this dissertation are: 1) to review the available evidence with respect to medical assessment and participation risk in endurance runners presenting with symptoms of acute illness before a road race; 2) to document the range of acute illnesses in runners presenting in the 3 days before a race; 3) to determine adherence to advice given by medical staff to these runners, and 4) to determine the effects of the outcomes of the medical assessment on running performance particularly, the ability to finish the race and the medical complications experienced during the race. These data are important to improve the medical care of runners (and other athletes) presenting with acute illness before training and competition. Methods: Phase 1: Review of the literature All literature relating to the epidemiology of acute illness in athletes, risk factors for illness, and participation risk, potential medical complications and effects on performance of exercising whilst ill were sourced using established electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar). In addition, literature related to the background of the ‘neck check’, as well as the evolution of the current RTP guidelines in athletes with acute illness were sourced. Phase 2: Research study In a prospective cohort study, 242 runners who presented to a pre-race registration medical facility with medical concerns were assessed by SEM physicians by means of medical history and physical examination (if indicated) using a specific Pre-Race acute Illness Medical Assessment (PRIMA group). 172 of these runners had evidence suggesting acute infective illness (PRIMA-I group) and 70 runners had non-infective complaints (PRIMA-N/I group). The epidemiology (prevalence rate = % runners) of runners with symptoms, signs and specific clinical diagnoses of acute illnesses were documented in the PRIMA-I group. Following clinical evaluation, all the runners in the PRIMA-I group were then advised regarding clearance to run the race, monitoring symptoms, or not running the race, using the ‘neck check’ as a guideline. Runners in the PRIMA cohort were then tracked during and immediately after the race, and the following parameters were compared to those in a control group of runners not presenting to the medical facility at registration (CON=53 734): 1) incidence of not starting of the race (per 1000 runners) (DNS rate), 2) incidence of not finishing the race in those who started (per 1000 runners) (DNF rate), and 3) incidence of medical complications during the race in those who started (per 1000 runners) (MC rate). Results Phase 1: Review The main finding of the review is the relative paucity in clinical data with respect to participation in athletes with acute illness. Upper respiratory tract symptoms are very common in athletes, and the risk factors are discussed. Furthermore, there are different aetiologies underlying athletes’ URT symptoms (other than infection). The documented risks of exercising when systemically ill include sudden cardiac death and reduced pulmonary function, splenic rupture in patients with infectious mononucleosis, and dehydration and electrolyte disturbances when exercising with acute gastro-intestinal illness. There is little evidence in the literature regarding the effects of illness on performance; these include reduced performance, non-participation and the potential effects of WARI  (wheezing after respiratory tract infection). Evidence supporting the two aspects of the neck check is reviewed: the presumed safety of exercising with localised URT symptoms, and the perceived risk of exercising with lower respiratory tract or systemic symptoms. Clinical data are severely lacking, and the available data are based on self-reported symptomatology. There are no published data regarding the use of the ‘neck check’ as a participation guideline. Phase 2: In the PRIMA-I cohort of 172 runners, the most common symptoms were sinus congestion (40.1%), cough (38.2%), sore throat (37.8%) and runny nose (25.6%). More than half the cohort (57.5%) had a diagnosis of localised URTI. However, URTI with generalised symptoms was the single most common diagnosis (22.7%). In the PRIMA-I group, 41.3% of the runners failed the ‘neck check’. Compared with the CON group, there was no significant difference in the DNS rate in the PRIMA-I group. However, in those runners who were advised not to run, the DNS rate was 565 per 1000 runners, and this was significantly higher than that of the CON group (192 per 1000 runners) (p&lt;0.0001). PRIMA-I race starters had a higher DNF rate (31 per 1000 runners), and runners with any medical concerns (PRIMA group) had a significantly higher DNF rate (37 per 1000 runners) compared to the CON group of runners who started the race (15 per 1000 runners) (p= 0.0329). There were no documented medical complications in the PRIMA-I group who started the race, while the MC rate of the CON group was 6.7 per 1000 runners. In runners in the PRIMA-I group who had been advised not to run, 43.5% were non-adherent, and started the race despite this advice. Conclusion: Our study indicates that localised upper respiratory tract infection is responsible for the majority of acute illness in a pre-race cohort of runners. Furthermore, the data provide some evidence that it is safe for runners with acute illness to exercise if they pass the ‘neck check’. However, presenting to a pre-race registration medical facility, failing the ‘neck check’ and receiving advice against participation appear to increase the risk of not finishing a race. There is also concern about the high rate of non-adherence to advice given by the SEM physician. Finally, a pre-race registration medical assessment for runners with acute illness may reduce the risk of developing short-term medical complications during the race.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Sphenoid wing meningiomas are benign tumors that result in proptosis, visual impairment and pain. Traditional open surgical approaches are associated with significant morbidity. Transorbital endoscopic surgery has been developed as a minimally invasive approach to gain access to these tumors and address the main presenting symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess long term vision and proptosis outcomes in patients undergoing a transorbital endoscopic resection of sphenoid wing meningioma using a combined endonasal, precaruncular and extended superior eyelid approach and to describe the surgical approach.  Materials &amp;amp; Methods  A retrospective chart review was conducted in 21 patients with lateral sphenoid wing meningioma at Groote Schuur Hospital &amp;amp; Cape Town Mediclinic from 2015–2019. All patients had undergone a transorbital endoscopic subtotal resection (Simpson grade II – IV) by the same surgical team. Vision was assessed using a Snellen chart and proptosis measured in mm using a Hertel exophthalmometer by an ophthalmologist. Measurements were taken at 6 weeks, 6 months and at 1 year postoperatively and compared to pre-operative values. Patients were categorized according to the WHO classification of vision into group A (blind), group B (low vision) &amp;amp; group C (normal vision) according to their pre-operative visual acuity. Nonparametric statistical tests employing the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test were used for analysis. Statistical significance was determined by a confidence interval of 0.95, p = &lt; 0.05 for both visual acuity (converted to LogMar) and proptosis in mm.  Results   A total of 21 patient charts were reviewed. The mean age of presentation was 48.8 years (range 34-79 years), and the majority of patients were female (20/21 = 95%). The most common presenting complaints were loss of vision (100%), proptosis (95%) and headache (76%). Preoperative visual results were as follows: 10 (48%) in group A (blind), 4 (19%) in group B (low vision) and 7 (33%) in group C (normal vision). In group A, 6 (60%) remained unchanged, 2 (20%) deteriorated &amp;amp; 1 (10%) improved. In group B, 3 (75%) improved, and 1 (25%) remained stable. In group C, 5 (71%) improved and 2 (29%) remained stable. Vision in groups B &amp;amp; C showed no deterioration. Patients in group A showed no benefit from optic nerve decompression. Vision in groups B &amp;amp; C showed a statistically significant improvement at 6 weeks [95% CI] (p = 0.021). This trend extended to long term follow up at 6 months [95% CI] (p= 0.021) and 1 year [95% CI] (p = 0.0054) postoperatively. Proptosis initially decreased, proving statistical significance at 6 weeks [95% CI] (p = 0.0054) postoperatively. The decrease at 6 months (p = 0.08) was not statistically significant and trended towards an increase in proptosis by 1 year (p = 0.78) postoperatively. The mean hospital stay was 2.7 days (range 2 – 4 days). The majority of tumors were histologically classified as WHO grade I.  Conclusion   Endoscopic medial optic canal decompression prior to transorbital multiportal surgery for sphenoid wing meningioma stabilizes or improves visual acuity for at least 1 year. Lateral orbitotomy via a superior eyelid approach and subtotal tumor resection initially decreases proptosis, but in the long term, returns to its preoperative state by 1 year if the main tumor component is not addressed. The earlier that medial optic nerve decompression is performed and the better the preoperative visual acuity, the greater the likelihood of favorable long-term visual outcomes.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Although HIV and antiretroviral drugs have been shown to cause damage in the brain, the long-term impacts of perinatal infection, early treatment and exposure in children at 11 years, remain unclear. The effects of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART), whilst indistinguishable, can be investigated at a chemical level through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Previous studies in children have largely focused on individual metabolite changes. However, several adult studies have now advanced beyond this to address patterns of metabolic activity that are altered with HIV infection. Using a 3T Skyra scanner, 136 children (76 HIV+, 30 HEU, 30 HU; 71 males) between the ages of 11.0- 12.5 years, and from a similar socioeconomic background, were scanned. In this study metabolite concentrations were quantified within the basal ganglia (BG), midfrontal gray matter (MFGM) and peritrigonal white matter (PWM). We utilised linear regression to investigate individual metabolite differences, comparing HIV-infected (HIV+) children from the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) trial, and HIV-exposed-uninfected (HEU) children, to HIV-unexposed (HU) children. Pearson's correlation analysis, factor analysis and logistic regression were then used to study alterations in metabolic patterns between HIV+ and HIV-uninfected (HIV-) children. Analysis of the data was carried out in R. We found elevated total choline in the BG (p = 0.03) and MFGM (p &lt; 0.001) of HIV+ children, as well as reduced PWM total NAA (p = 0.03) and total creatine (p = 0.01). Altered metabolite concentrations were further observed in HEU children. Additionally, we identified a cross-regional coupling of choline which distinguishes HIV+ from HIV- children (p &lt; 0.001). These findings indicate that multiregional inflammation and PWM axonal damage are occurring in HIV+ children at 11 years. Ultimately, the consequences of perinatal HIV acquisition, in spite of early treatment, continue to be seen at 11 years, as do the impacts of exposure.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis examines the communication of meaning in the context of the translation from French into English of a contemporary Moroccan novel, Une Vie à Trois, by Bahaa Trabelsi. To explore the notion of a faithful translation, the approach of the Ecole Superieure d'lnterpretes et de Traducteurs (ESIT) is examined. This approach, developed by Danica Seleskovitch and Marianne Lederer, emphasises the communication of meaning and the crucial role that interpretation plays in the act of translation. The project is composed of two parts - the practical application of the ESIT approach in the production of a translation of Une Vie à Trois and a theoretical study of the approach.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Security governance is a salient topic within South Africa, both in public media, discourse and academic literature. Currently, South African government holds a domineering mentality towards security and wishes to monopolize it. Nonetheless, there is a growing call for private security, both by citizens and the business sector in South Africa. Furthermore, private security is a polemic issue with debates around its effects on public good as well as its role within society. This dissertation underlines and addresses these issues. In order to accomplish this, an ethnographic field study was conducted to uncover the situation and the forms and issues that revolve around private security on a ground level, breaking away from the academic cacophony that has saturated the field.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>When identities collide: becoming founders in pastoralist Kenya</dc:title>

   <dc:description>There is an increasing number of entrepreneurship initiatives that aim to address extreme poverty, but we know little about how they shape founder identity and how diverse identities shape behavior. Although founder identity is a burgeoning field of study, theory is based primarily on research in developed country contexts. We know little about how founder identities emerge and change, and this gap is pronounced with respect to contexts of extreme poverty. I therefore explore how founder identities emerge and change in contexts of extreme poverty with a longitudinal study in a pastoralist community in Northern Kenya, where business itself is nascent, and impoverished pastoralists are in the early stages of learning basic business concepts. I conduct an inductive, qualitative study of 51 pastoralists over three years. Applying both social identity theory and identity theory lenses, this study identifies extant social and role identities that shape what it means to be a founder, as well as new identities introduced through business education and exposure, which conflict with extant identities. I identify three types of founder identity and develop a model illustrating the process through which they emerge based on varied responses to the identity conflict. Founders either maintain emphasis on extant identities, balance emphasis between some extant identities and some new identities, or transform to emphasize new identities, thus shaping who they become as a founder. When founders deviate from external expectations associated with extant identities, they engage in various forms of external identity work to increase acceptance of new behaviors and expectations and change perceptions of who they are as a founder. I further demonstrate that who one becomes as a founder is regulated by the degree of internalization and importance of extant identities that become part of what it means to be a founder in addition to other social identities held by the founder. My findings contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty by providing a more nuanced conceptualization of founder identity in these contexts, including identification of three types of founder identity. I also contribute to both the literature on entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty and founder identity theory more broadly by explaining the process through which founder identities emerge, introducing regulating identities as an explanation for variance in founder identity change, and bringing external identity work to the fore as a key process in founder identity construction and change. My findings also highlight the importance of applying an identity lens to the study of entrepreneurship initiatives in contexts of extreme poverty. I outline future research directions, as well as practical implications for organizations that aim to stimulate and develop entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty through education and access to resources.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In this dissertation, the author focuses on the practical tax issues relating to the recently adopted South African Real Estate Investment Trust tax dispensation, by discussing international principles of Real Estate Investment Trust taxation and two foreign regimes, i.e. the US and UK Real Estate Investment Trust regimes which, it is understood, were used as a basis for the South African legislation. In addition, the dissertation discusses the details of the South African property investment vehicles regime pre- 1 April 2013, and the new Real Estate Investment Trust tax regime applicable from 1 April 2013. Furthermore, it looks at suggestions and possible improvement to the taxation of Real Estate Investment Trusts in South Africa and whether the proposed amendments released by National Treasury, on 4 July 2013, satisfactorily address the issues raised in this dissertation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The introduction of the Traditional Health Practitioners Act 22 of 2007 has made lawful the practice of traditional healing. As everyone has the right of access to health care services, the question of whether the state bears a duty to reasonably provide access to traditional healing as an element of its public health care service, is raised. In a democratic society, law must be responsive to the needs of the populace. Ethnographic fieldwork demonstrates that traditional healing is used not in opposition to, but as a complementary twin of, biomedicine. Considering this, it shall be argued that economically, socially and medically, the incorporation of traditional healing into the public health care service is neither appropriate nor required by the Constitution.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The road to Absalom</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Gastrow, Michael</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>Creative Writing</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The Road to Absalom is set in contemporary South Africa, where, for much of the predominantly young population, the country's ancien regime is little more than a childhood memory. David is a young articled clerk living a hedonistic and carefree life with his model girlfriend, Georgina, in Cape Town. When the entire family of the Xhosa chief of a remote rural valley is murdered he is sent in search of any remaining heirs. The new chief would be a lucrative client for the law firm. The search begins at the site of the massacre. David discovers that the only surviving heir, Absalom, has been missing for several years. He picks up the trail at Absalom's old university, where an ex-lecturer tells him about Absalom's early political consciousness (dismay at his family's collaboration with the white regime), his increasing rebelliousness, and his eventual disappearance. Local gangsters tell David more about Absalom's life as a criminal and an exile from his own family, circumstances which led him to move to Soweto. David drives across the interior of South Africa to Soweto, but does not find Absalom. His contact there arranges a meeting with Absalom's mentor and protector  - Pius, a chief drug-smuggler resident in Swaziland. The hours of driving give David the time and perspective to reflect on his life in Cape Town: his dysfunctional relationship with Georgina, his fixation on his mixed-race high school lover, Angeline, his unwanted job and his ambivalent relationship with his family. He suspects that his supposedly convenient life has been constructed from fear or self-deception, and he is forced to re-evaluate his motivations. The meeting with Pius uncovers broad issues involving local and global politics that have contributed to Absalom's family's massacre and to his disappearance. However, Absalom has left to train as a Sangoma. David drives to Durban, where another sangoma gives him directions to the initiate's retreat in the Drakensberg mountains. He finds Absalom's spiritual master, a secretive bushman shaman, who explains that Absalom had abandoned his spiritual studies when he was told to do so by a powerful Spirit of nature. With the shaman's help David experiences a vision of Absalom's new hide-away on the coast. In the morning David follows the directions of his vision until he finds Absalom. The pair combine their knowledge: it emerges that their respective pasts have locked them into their present trajectories. David's family and his law firm (as well as a giant construction company and the World Bank) are involved in the events leading up to the massacre, while the past betrayals of the chief's family helped bring about their deaths. However, the pair abstain from the roles described for them by history, choosing instead to construct their own responses in an attempt to continue towards self-determining lives.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Unsuccessful IVF treatment</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Ghanaian women experiencing infertility problem, have been seeking invitro fertilisation treatment in the quest for motherhood, however there is a dearth in the nursing studies researching this phenomenon. It appears that the concept and meanings of infertility is inadequately explored from the perspective of women experiences following unsuccessful invitro fertilisation treatment. In particular, it is vital to be knowledgeable about the challenges women encounter when undergoing IVF treatment and following unsuccessful procedure. The study sought to gain a deeper knowledge and to understand the meanings women struggling with infertility and its treatment experience and how invitro fertilisation treatment failure affects women in their everyday life. To unearth the women perception and meaning attributed to their experiences of unsuccessful infertility treatment, Heidegger's philosophy of phenomenology underpinned this study. A semistructured opening question and further probing questions were used to gather information which was reduced to sub-themes and main themes which captured the participant's lived experiences of unsuccessful invitro fertilisation treatment. I adopted van Manen's (1990) six steps of research activities as a structure to unravel the participants' phenomenological conversations. Applying Heidegger's concept of the three modes of existence (Existenze): authenticity, inauthenticity and undifferentiatedness, four major themes were identified: 1. Seeking wholistic and authentic care- authenticity 2. Facing up to the Angst- inauthenticity 3. The vulnerable self - inauthenticity 4. Living with infertility (being-in-the-world-of-motherless) - undifferentiatedness The participants' phenomenological conversations and their stories have revealed a range of challenges Ghanaian women who seek invitro fertilisation treatment go through. The study contribute significantly by giving insight to the painful experiences Ghanaian women go through when seeking invitro fertilisation treatment and has given a voice to how assisted reproductive technologies are currently experienced in the Ghanaian context. From the women's narrative, it appeared that their emotional and informational needs were not being met and were not being cared for as expected. The findings provide some direction regarding the needs of women experiencing infertility for information, support and advocacy in their pursuit of assisted reproductive technology services in Ghana. There is a critical need to simplify invitro fertilisation treatment and provision of safe, affordable procedure so that the average Ghanaian women can access it.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research investigates the techniques used to improve the standard Mobile IP handover process and provide proactivity in network mobility management. Numerous fast handover proposals in the literature have recently adopted a cross-layer approach to enhance movement detection functionality and make terminal mobility more seamless. Such fast handover protocols are dependent on an anticipated link-layer trigger or pre-trigger to perform pre-handover service establishment operations. This research identifies the practical difficulties involved in implementing this type of trigger and proposes an alternative solution that integrates the concept of mobility prediction into a reactive fast handover scheme.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study explored the experiences of Tendai, a 50 year old migrant from Zimbabwe currently living and working in Cape Town. The approach adopted was that of narrative inquiry, an approach to research that advocates open and informal interviewing and brings theory into conversation with stories as opposed to using it as a kind of structuring framework. The field work for this study was carried out over a period of 4 moths. Interviews were held in Tendai's home in Khayelitsha and were recorded and transcribed, along with detailed field notes.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Rape as Torture: Is South Africa in Breach of its International Obligations?</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Chavda, Reshma</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Barratt, Amanda</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>International Public Law</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Rape is one of the most heinous and degrading crimes that exist. It attacks the victim's sense of human dignity and self-worth. Some argue that the crime of rape is akin to that of torture. The issue of rape is one that is experienced around the world; however, South Africa is one of the highest countries affected. This paper argues that South Africa is in contravention of its international obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, specifically with regards to the crime of rape and its relation to the crime of torture. This paper aims to prove the above statement through, first establishing a link between the crimes of rape and torture and that that this link is applicable in both international law and South African law. This paper will proceed to show that there are obligations, stemming from both international and domestic laws, on South Africa to take positive steps in preventing the crime of rape among private persons. This paper will demonstrate that through failing its obligation of due diligence in this regard, the state of South Africa fails to comply with the duties imposed upon it by international law.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>At a global scale, kelp forests play a significant ecological, social and economic role through their provision of ecosystem services. South African kelp forests are no exception and recent studies have established their value. To maintain these benefits, informed management is needed. An understanding of kelp forest distribution, ecosystem functioning, pressures, and ecosystem state are key requirements for effective management. The South African National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) synthesises research to report on the status of ecosystems to guide policy, planning and decision making. Kelp forests were excluded from two previous national assessments, as they were not represented on the National Map of Marine Ecosystem types. This thesis aimed to address this omission by producing a map of kelp forest ecosystem types and conducting the first assessment of their threat status. This study sought to develop a modern method for mapping South African kelp forests to update previous maps developed in the mid-2000s. The novel approach extracts the Vegetation Index from kelp forests using advanced multi-resolution Sentinel-2 (A and B) satellite imagery. Using Geographic Information Systems, spectral bands 4 (RED) and 8 (NIR) (10 m resolution) were utilized to calculate Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). An expert-guided trial and error approach was adopted to set the NDVI threshold (-0.2) at a level suitable for detecting both subtidal and surface buoyant kelp to the limits of the Sentinel-2 platform. The results showed that the high resolution and deeper water column penetration of this platform enabled the filling of previous gaps and detect both subtidal and surface protruding kelps at low cost. Additionally, the map includes for the first time, the kelp recently reported to have shifted eastwards along the south coast. A total of 1300 km of kelp forest was mapped and three biogeographical subtypes distinguished. Combining the NDVI threshold method and Supervised Classification yielded satisfactory results and an accuracy of 76%. Sentinel-2 imagery was validated using observational classification from Google Earth, field surveys expert knowledge and previous maps. However, the Sentinel's depth penetration was affected by environmental heterogeneity along this coast. Results confirmed the complexities of retrieving spectral indices from environments with varying turbidity, depths, wave climates and the challenges associated with ground-truthing the expansive marine environment. This study advises comprehensive ground-truthing for the three kelp forest ecosystem types as a fundamental step towards long-term monitoring of South African kelp forests. The method developed advanced application of the NDVI in submerged aquatic vegetation mapping and could be modified to support mapping of other ecosystem types such as seagrasses, other seaweed habitats and inland aquatic vegetation. South Africa's new kelp forest map was then used to facilitate the first ecosystem threat status assessment for South African kelp forests using three criteria from the emerging International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN RLE). To assess threat status, ecosystem extent and condition were considered. Three kelp forest ecosystem types were assessed; namely Namaqua, Cape and Agulhas Kelp Forests and an additional combined single South African Kelp Forest to explore the effect of scale in assessing threat status. Literature was reviewed to develop a conceptual model to support the assessment and define ecosystem collapse. Thirteen relevant pressures were mapped to determine ecosystem degradation across the extent of each kelp forest type using a cumulative pressure mapping approach. Four categories of ecosystem condition were recognized in alignment with the IUCN thresholds for ecosystem degradation. The results of the ecosystem threat status assessment show sensitivity to the different assessment criteria, the scale of ecosystem delineation and assessment approaches. There is no reported reduction in the distribution for any of the South African kelp forest ecosystem types, therefore, the decline in extent under criterion (A) was assessed as Least Concern for all types. For criterion (B) which is related to geographic extent and threat, results were most sensitive to ecosystem delineation with results ranging between Least Concern and Critically Endangered under different sub-criteria and for different ecosystem types. Also, for the criterion (C) which is related to the extent of abiotic degradation, the results ranged from Vulnerable to Endangered under different sub-criteria and for different ecosystem types. Further work is needed to validate kelp forest ecosystem types; consider the implications of multiple scales of classification, mapping and assessment; improve pressure data, groundtruth ecosystem condition, and assess the disruption of biotic processes. In line with the protocols of the IUCN RLE, South African kelp forest ecosystem types appear threatened with plausible results ranging between Vulnerable and Endangered. The accuracy of these assessments can be strengthened by more research to refine conceptual models, calibrate assessments of degradation and better define thresholds of collapsed ecosystems.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis examines why there has been persistent conflict over land in Africa, with reference to Kibaale district in western Uganda. The land conflicts, especially in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa, are attributed to such factors as the colonial legacy which has contributed to unequal access and conflicting identities. By tracing the conflict from the British colonial period, the thesis contributes to an understanding of how it evolved and why it was not resolved by the end of colonial rule and in post-colonial Uganda. The thesis draws on Mamdani's theory of decentralized despotism to establish the extent to which the post-colonial central governments' maintenance of some rural despotic authorities has undermined the land conflict resolution efforts. I contend that, though the post- colonial governments' maintenance of landlordism has partly contributed to the land-related conflict in Uganda, it does not fully explain why the conflict has persisted in places such as Kibaale district. Based on data generated through in-depth interviews with purposively sampled participants, archives and from secondary sources, the thesis contributes to an improved understanding of why land-related conflicts in Africa have persisted. It particularly shows what has undermined the ability of post-colonial governments and other stakeholders to address the roots of these conflicts. The main findings of the thesis include: the bitter memories of the late 19th and early 20th century British colonial conquest and land dispossession of people in Kibaale are still reflected in the narratives of the early settlers; the government-sponsored and selfmotivated massive resettlement of people from mainly Western Uganda to Kibaale district has increased the complexity of land disputes; different peoples' identities have also contributed to the conflict in Kibaale; and the national as well as local political actors have often intensified the conflict for the sake of political power. The thesis concludes that the instrumentalization of citizenship and belonging by the autochthons as well as the specific historical and socioeconomic factors in Kibaale district have contributed to persistent conflict over access to and ownership of land.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Computer-mediated reality technologies have the potential to improve the imageguided surgery (IGS) workflow; specifically, pre-surgical planning, intra-operative guidance, post-surgical assessment, and rehabilitation. Augmented reality (AR), a form of computer-mediated reality, uses an electronic display or projection module to add a hologram in the user's field of view (FOV). For intra-operative guidance, AR could aid in reducing the cognitive overload experienced by clinicians due to integrating multi-modal imaging data from several sources while performing the intervention on the patient. Three AR HMD systems have been developed to explore the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens as an AR HMD to be used in developing an AR HMD medical system. The three AR HMD systems required different software and hardware system architectures, however, each of the AR HMD system's software applications has been developed in Unity combined with the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). Each of the AR HMD systems implemented different registration techniques to localize the virtual object in the real-world coordinate system. The registration techniques were user calibration alignment to identified anatomical landmarks, fiducial marker tracking, and markerless tracking. For user calibration with anatomical landmarks, the MRTK was manipulated to allow alignment of the virtual object. For fiducial registration, the Vuforia Software Development Kit (SDK) was added to assess the alignment and spatial anchoring of the virtual object as specified. Finally, the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) and Leap's Orion SDK was used for exploring markerless tracking. The AR HMD systems developed enabled performance assessments, and alignment errors were identified during trials of the three systems. Most notably the location drift of the 3D virtual object in the spatial space due to the clinician moving around the registered location. This project entailed preliminary development towards the AR HMD medical system to create an in-vivo view of 3D patient-specific bone geometries as a hologram in the clinician's FOV.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A financial economic approach to management information in the wine industry</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Wine is a beverage that accompanies and enhances a wide range of occasions, cuisines and even religious ceremonies in many cultures. It claims health benefits and brings wonderful memories to mind. We all have our own story to tell when it comes to wine. This however represents the consumer's experience. What is the producer's experience? Situation Wine markets across the globe are under pressure. According to Nielsen, over 3300 wine brands have flood grocery stores since 1999 and they now represent about 70% of active brands. South Africa owns 2.4% of the world's export market share, the 9th biggest, while wine production ranks 8t1, the world, producing 855,3 million liters for 1.7% of the worlds total production. Wine producers receive only 2% of the average R24 shelf price per 750m1 bottle of wine sold in supermarkets and at other retail outlets. On top of this the VinPro agricultural economist says wine production costs have increased by 17% but producers' incomes have risen only by an average of 3%. The industry had to deal with many challenges in its more than 300 year history e.g. the complete destruction of vineyards in 1890's due to phylloxera, single channel marketing, etc. but the economic reality of income not keeping pace with rising production costs brings one of the biggest challenges yet to the industry. Currently South Africa is known for its superb technical skills as far as wine making and viticulture is concerned. This can be seen from the amount of awards we as a country win in international competitions. It does not however create the necessary profits on the bottom line. It helps to sell the product, but still wine producers are more and more under extreme financial pressure and the current world economic condition is not helping. It is just not good enough to make the best possible wine any more, as several other forces are obviously at play here. We need to get an improved understanding of what really makes this business viable.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The prevalence and predictors of antipsychotic medication non-adherence among clients with psychotic disorders in Mzimba, Malawi</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Myaba, Japhet</dc:creator>

   <dc:subject>Public Mental Health</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Background: Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders significantly contribute to the burden of diseases worldwide. Schizophrenia is one of the severe forms of MNS disorders. Antipsychotic medications play a significant role in the treatment and management of schizophrenia. However, non-adherence to antipsychotic medication is a recognized problem. At the present time, a majority of the research investigating non-adherence to medication in this population has been conducted in high income countries, with only a few studies available from low and middle income countries such as Malawi. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and predictors of antipsychotic non-adherence among clients with psychosis in Mzimba district, Malawi. The factors were categorized into patient-related, medication related and environmental related. Methodology: This was a hospital based quantitative study conducted in Mzimba, Malawi. 150 patients attending outpatient treatment facilities from three mental health clinics were recruited in the study. All recruited participants had a diagnosis of psychosis. The recruitment process targeted every potential participant during a clinic day. Potential participants were approached by the research assistant after their appointment with the healthcare provider to participate in the study. The following measures were included in the interview administered survey: 1) the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8; the Birchwood Insight Scale; the Drug Attitude Inventory-10; the Glasgow Antipsychotic Side-effects Scale; a Social Support questionnaire, and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. A logistic regression model was developed to investigate the associations between socio demographic and illness related factors and non-adherence to medication. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cape Town before the beginning of the study. Ethical approval was also obtained from National Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee in Malawi. Results: More than half of the participants were male (n=84). The average age of all participants was 34 years of age (sd=9.40). 43.9% of the respondents were identified as non-adherent (n=66). In the unadjusted logistic regression model, the amount of insight a client had about their mental illness, the side effects of antipsychotic medication, and the form or type of medication, were all found to be significantly associated with antipsychotic medication non-adherence. For example, participants with poor insight were less likely to adhere to antipsychotic medication (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.95). When these three variables were adjusted for age and gender, they all predicted non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; insight (OR=0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.90); side effects (OR=1.10. 95% CI 1.03-1.17); and medication type or form (OR=0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.91). Conclusion: The study was the first study conducted in Mzimba, Malawi to investigate nonadherence rates among patients with psychosis. Similar to other studies conducted globally, the non-adherence rates to antipsychotic medication reported in the present study was high. The risk factors predicting non-adherence have the potential to assist in the development and delivery of interventions to address among this population.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study focuses on the state of the environment of the Little Karoo and is comprised of three main analyses. In the first analysis, a fine-scale vegetation map of the Little Karoo (Vlok et aI., 2005) comprised of 369 vegetation units and 56 habitats within 6 biomes (or sub-units of a biome) was linked to a degradation map (Thompson et al., 2005) of the region. Using these data sets the extent of transformation and degradation with the major biomes, habitat units and vegetation units in the Little Karoo was quantified. The results were then compared with previous assessments of degradation in the area. In the second analysis, the output from the quantification of degradation was used to develop a map of the ecosystem status of the Little Karoo within four classes (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and Least Threatened). Conservation targets were modified according to the number of species and degree of endemism within each vegetation unit. Finally, using long-term climate and agricultural census records, the historic causes of degradation in the region were also investigated. The results indicate that 53.4% of the habitat units are moderately degraded with 14.1 % considered severely degraded. The Succulent Karoo biome, Azonal habitats and Thicket biome are particularly affected by degradation. When comparing the results of this study to those of the South African National Land cover assessment, it appears that the extent of degradation in the Little Karoo has been substantially under-estimated in the past. In terms of ecosystem status it was found that of the 369 vegetation units mapped 26 (7.1 %) were classified as Critically Endangered 58 (15.7 %) Endangered, 67 (18.2 %) Vulnerable and 218 (59.1 %) Least Threatened. The Succulent Karoo has the highest number (13) of Critically Endangered vegetation units in the study area. An analysis of climate data of the study area did not show any statistically significant long-term changes in rainfall and temperature except for Ladismith which has experienced a decline in rainfall and increase in mean annual minimum temperature over the last fifty years. Lucerne is the dominant crop in the region and its production has increased. There has been a general decline in goat numbers but an increase in sheep and ostriches over the last 100 years. It is concluded that anthropogenic forces underline the changes that have taken place in the Little Karoo especially, grazing by domestic livestock, ostrich farming and lucerne cultivation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Purpose of the Study: The primary aim of this research is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy, or lack thereof, of percutaneous cholecystostomy placement as a management option in patients with acute cholecystitis (AC), not suitable for cholecystectomy and not responding to best medical management. The secondary aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility and complexities of interval cholecystectomy in this cohort of patients, with respect to the conversion rate to open, operating time and performing a subtotal cholecystectomy. Background: Acute cholecystitis is a complication of cholelithiasis (gallstones) and one of the most common admission diagnoses in Acute Care Surgery Units. The standard of care, according to the Tokyo Guidelines (1-4), for the management of acute cholecystitis, includes the immediate use of empiric antimicrobial drugs and index-admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A (&gt;72 hour) delay between the onset of symptoms and presentation and initiation of medical care, as well as high operative risk patients are the two main reasons for diversion from this protocol of care. In the case of delay, the guidelines suggest the use of interval (six week) cholecystectomy as appropriate care. Index admission cholecystectomy in the setting of delayed presentation has been associated with increased morbidity. As inflammation of the gallbladder progresses, the tissues become more oedematous, with anatomic distortion and therefore increased difficulty in identifying important structural landmarks during LC. This difficulty increases the risk of operative complications, including bleeding and common bile duct injury, the most feared complication of LC. In addition to this distortion, adjacent surrounding organs may be involved in this inflammatory complex, thereby also being placed at risk of injury during dissection. In such circumstances, alternative methods of controlling disease progression may be necessary. 7 According to the Tokyo guidelines (1-4), AC can be classified into three grades of severity, namely mild (grade I), moderate (grade II) and severe (grade III). The grading system takes into account clinical and laboratory parameters, with organ dysfunction representing more advanced disease. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement has been described as a method to achieve sepsis control in patients with severe AC, in which case LC may not be safe, owing to operative and high anaesthetic risk. The use of percutaneous cholecystostomy is well established in critically ill patients with acalculous cholecystitis and its safety and efficacy have been reported in many studies (5-11). Early LC has recently been shown to reduce the rate of major complications as compared to PC, even in high risk patients (15) The management of one subset of patients with acute cholecystitis remains unclear. This group comprises those with delayed presentation, in whom index-admission surgery is not advised, but who subsequently do not respond to best medical therapy. They have traditionally undergone urgent cholecystectomy but suffer higher rates of both morbidity and mortality (12- 14). In the current setting, patients often present with a delay since the onset of symptoms, rendering index-admission cholecystectomy unsafe. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of urgent operating theatre time, often with more urgent cases taking preference, thus delaying operative care beyond what is deemed safe by the Tokyo guidelines. The vast majority of patients are managed by interval cholecystectomy, leaving only the mentioned unresponsive subset. Recent reports have established the safety of the use of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in patient groups that include this subset (severe sepsis, septic shock, local gallbladder rupture, progressive intolerant pain and persistent fever) (5-11).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Various sources of evidence suggest that dream frequency, intensity and vividness are increased with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRJ's) commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety. In this study the effects ofSSRI use on dream frequency, intensity and vividness in psychiatric patients was examined through a comparision of the dream characteristics of an SSRI- medicated patient group vs. an unmedicated patient control group. Each group comprised 20 patients recruited through state psychiatric outpatient facilities affiliated with two research universities. Age and gender were evenly spread across the two groups. Psychiatric disorders represented were generalised an.xiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and social phobia. Patients completed a questionnaire consisting of a most recent dream report and self-report likert-scaled questions regarding dream frequency, intensity, vividness and memorability. Two independent raters rated the dream reports for intensity on a likert scale. Self-reported visual vividness was significantly higher (p=0.027, effect size .86) among SSRI users compared with controls, whereas selJreported dream frequency and emotional intensity as well as independent raters assessment of dream intensity were not significantly different across the two groups. Findings of increased dream vividness without increases in dream frequency complement the results of an earlier study. Since serotonin is suppressed during REM sleep, these findings cast further doubt upon the notion of an isomorphic link between REM sleep and dreaming and argue for the searchfor a more sophisticated model of neurotransmitter modulation of sleep-cognition.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The importance of Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and Information Technology (IT) is widely acknowledged. Various government initiatives leverage both for socio-economic development and national growth. However, SMEs are characterised by lack of resources, which hamper IT value delivery. IT governance is a mechanism for maximizing IT value and has the potential for alleviating the barriers to IT use in SMEs. Notwithstanding its benefits, empirical evidence on IT governance in 5MBs is scant. The purpose of this research is to contribute to knowledge in this field. The literature suggests that IT governance and SMEs should be investigated from managerial, organizational and external perspectives. This research examined the impact of selected managerial, organisational and external characteristics of SMEs on IT governance practices and the relationship between such practices and IT value. Data was collected in a survey involving firms in the IT, finance, transport and retail sectors in three provinces in South Africa.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Mapping desertification: towards an approach for mapping regional land degradation in drylands</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Land degradation in drylands (desertification) is an issue that potentially impacts nearly half of the world's human population living on over a third of the Earth's land surface. Despite global concern of the impact of desertification on people and the environment, there is no universal method to assess and map desertification. Methods to assess desertification at the local to regional scale that can fit into a broader global desertification narrative are more appropriate. The overall objective of this thesis is to assess regional desertification using field and Earth observation data for the Namaqualand Hardeveld bioregion of South Africa. Field data on the condition of the land from 277 plots was analysed using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and found to cluster into three separate states. The first state (S1) was comprised primarily of degraded plots. The third state (S3), on the other hand, was comprised primarily of non-degraded plots, while the plots in state two (S2) generally fell between those which were assigned to S1 and S3. Through the LCA, each plot was assigned a probability of belonging to each state, and the most important variables in distinguishing the three states (perennial plant cover and bare ground cover) were identified. A total of 16 remote sensing variables were determined for the project area. Five vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, OSAVI, MSAVI), as well as spectral mixture analysis (SMA) cover estimates for perennial vegetation, bare ground and bare rock were calculated using both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A data. These variables were used in a series of Partial Least Squares regression (PLSr) models to predict either the probability of a plot belonging to one of the three latent states, or the field estimated perennial plant and bare ground cover. The best performing PLSr model had ten remote sensing variables predicting the field estimates of cover (R2Ycum = 0.592; Q2cum = 0.554). Both Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 SMA cover estimates were better at predicting field cover than any of the vegetation indices. Estimates of bare ground and perennial plant cover were projected over the project area using the PLSr model and ground truthed using data from 61 independent field test plots. There was a significant correlation between the PLSr estimates and the field estimates for both perennial plant cover and bare ground cover for the test plots with the best correlation found to be between the PLSr estimate of bare ground and field estimated bare ground cover (r = 0.827, p &lt; 0.001, CI [0.727, 0.893]). The trendline slope and percentile range of a time series of the Landsat SMA bare ground estimate were used to create raster images. These images, along with images for the PLSr bare ground and perennial plant cover estimates, were converted into images representing membership values between zero and one for the habitat condition archetype. These three images were then combined to produce one raster representing the overall membership of the project area to the habitat condition archetype. The importance of five potential drivers of land degradation (elevation, slope aspect, slope steepness, rainfall trend, and land tenure) in predicting PLSrestimated perennial plant and bare ground cover were evaluated using a random forest model. All drivers were found to be important predictors of cover and were included in the construction of the final, multi-band archetype image. If habitat condition classes are designated according to the mean archetype membership value ± one / two standard deviations, then 17% of the project area could be considered moderately degraded, with just over 3% severely degraded. This novel method of assessing and mapping desertification leads to improved accuracy in predicting habitat condition in the context of potential drivers of change. The utility of SMA over traditional vegetation indices is supported for this particular environment. This methodology can be improved with better endmember designation as well as improved spatial data on the potential drivers of change in drylands. The archetype approach ensures less subjectivity in map production, and the retention of pertinent information in map products. The approach developed in this thesis will allow for more accurate desertification reporting for UNCCD member states and will ultimately improve efforts to combat desertification globally.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Native freshwater fish are in decline worldwide due to human impacts including impoundment, changes to water quality, over-abstraction, climate change and the introduction of non-native species. South Africa's Cape Fold Ecoregion (CFE) harbours exceptionally high freshwater fish endemism, yet the majority of these species are threatened with extinction. The Clanwilliam sandfish (Labeo seeberi), an endangered cyprinid, has declined across its range in the CFE and currently exists in only a handful of tributaries of the Doring River in severely fragmented populations. The last remaining recruiting sandfish population occurs in the Oorlogskloof River, making this tributary one of critical conservation value. In this study, I analysed a six-year dataset comprising fish survey data from 38 sites along 25 km of the Oorlogskloof River to characterise spatio-temporal variation in sandfish abundance and size structure and evaluate the relative influence of different environmental factors on sandfish population trends. The environmental factors considered included other fish in the system, especially three non-native fishes (banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus), temperature, precipitation, habitat characteristics and a range of physicochemical factors. The results show that sandfish have experienced a 93% decline in the sampled stretch of the Oorlogskloof River since 2013 and that the ongoing drought may be preventing recovery. They also suggest that banded tilapia do not adversely affect the Oorlogskloof River sandfish population, while predation of juveniles by smallmouth bass and/or bluegill sunfish apparently reduces the abundance of sandfish, especially of juveniles, where these non-native fish are present. Future studies should attempt to isolate the relative impacts of the different invasive fish species and examine habitat requirements of different sandfish life stages. Management of the river's sandfish population should focus on precautionary actions such as continued monitoring and landowner engagement, as well as clearing dams of non-native species high in the catchment, to prevent the further upstream invasion of smallmouth bass and bluegill sunfish. Proactive measures, such as eradicating smallmouth bass and bluegill sunfish from the Oorlogskloof River, are also necessary to restore connectivity of suitable sandfish habitat in the Doring River system.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Introduction Damage control laparotomy (DCL) in an urban trauma centre is associated with high mortality. Aim The purpose of this prospective study was to review the outcomes of DCL in a level one urban trauma centre, looking particularly at primary closure rate and other factors influencing outcomes. Methods All patients undergoing DCL for penetrating trauma from May 2015 to July 2017 were retrieved from the prospectively recorded eTHR data base. Data retrieved were basic demographics, mechanism of injury, perioperative vitals and biochemical parameters. Injury severity was described by the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS). Indications for DCL were determined as well as length of ICU stay, days of ventilation, number of procedures and primary abdominal closure rates. Complications and mortality were recorded. Results During the study period, 51 patients underwent DCL. Three patients sustained stab wounds and 47 patients suffered from gunshots. Only 1 female was included in the study with the other 50 being male. The mean age was 28 years and 4 months (range 15 to 48 years). Indications for laparotomy were haemodynamic instability (n = 27) and peritonism in stable patients (n = 22). The means for the different severity scores were RTS 7.36, ISS 17.5, TRISS 93.76 and PATI 28. Means were calculated for different physiological markers of trauma (lowest pH 7.12, highest lactate 7.11, lowest core temp 34.9˚C and lowest systolic BP 63.8 mmHg). The organs most commonly injured, in decreasing frequency, were small bowel (n = 33), large bowel (n = 25), abdominal vasculature (n = 22), liver (n = 18), stomach (n = 14), kidney (n = 10), diaphragm (n = 10), spleen (n = 9) and pancreas (n = 8). DCL procedures performed were abdominal packing (n = 36), bowel ligation (n = 30), vascular shunting (n = 5) and shunting of the ureter (n = 1). The median number of laparotomies done per patient was 3, with a primary fascial closure rate of 69%. The mortality rate was 29%. Conclusion DCL in our setting is associated with a 29% mortality rate. Severe acidosis, massive blood transfusion in first 24hours and median PATI score more than 47 are independent factors associated with increased mortality.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>During the last ten years, several patients have presented to the Renal Unit of Groote Schuur Hospital with acute renal failure following the use of traditional (N'anga or Gqirha) medication. The history together with abnormal liver-function tests and renal failure was thought to be suggestive of a toxic aetiology. The specific toxin however remained unknown, until during the admission of one patient, a relative brought in the medication, analysis of which revealed a high concentration of potassium dichromate. Subsequently elevated levels of chromium were demonstrated by atomic absorption spectrometry in the blood and urine of this patient. Following this case there have been six further cases of acute renal failure resulting from use of dichromate containing traditional remedies. These remedies were obtained from a variety of sources including street-hawkers, herbal chemists, and traditional healers. Clinical and laboratory data relating to these seven patients will be presented.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The primary aim of this work was to study systematically V20 5 promotion on yAI203 supported cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. The y-Ah03 support was modified by addition of varying amounts of vanadia and was subsequently loaded with the same Co content (10 wt-%). The modified supports and catalysts were characterised using conventional characterisation methods. The physio-chemical properties of the vanadia promoted supports and catalysts were characterised using Atomic Adsorption Spectroscopy (AAS), zeta-potential measurements, and BET measurements, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and CO chemisorption. Catalyst performance in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was tested in fixed bed reactor. A catalysts synthesised from plain y-A1203 was used as a base catalyst. Characterization results show that modification of y-Ab03 support to obtain V205 loadings beyond 1-monolayer vanadia coverage was difficult when using ion exchange. Ion-exchange equilibrium limitations might have caused the poor vanadia loadings beyond 1-monolayer coverage. The supports net surface charge as measured using zeta potential, was decreased by vanadia content in the supports. CO chemisorption results were complex and could only be modelled using dual site Langmuir model assuming the presence of two different sites absorbing CO on the Co-V-AI catalyst system. This made extraction of physical properties from this method rather difficult. Fischer Tropsch synthesis reaction was carried out at typical industrial conditions (T=220°C, P=20 bar (a), H2/CO=2 Xco-60 mol-%) for cobalt catalysts. Vanadia promoted catalysts showed a marked decrease in initial activity. However, the overall deactivation rate was lower with increasing vanadia content. The vanadia content did not affect the chain growth kinetic behavior of the catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis hence C5+ selectivity in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was unperturbed by vanadia content. Increasing the vanadia content in the catalyst resulted in high n-olefin content and high 1-olefin content. The observed increase in olefin content might be due to the low catalytic activity observed for the catalysts with high vanadia loadings. The most pronounced effect of vanadia promotion on Fischer Tropsch synthesis was in the oxygenate content in the Fischer-Tropsch product. Catalysts with high vanadia loading yielded high amounts of oxygenate products; mainly alcohols and aldehydes.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The Land Bank's retail emerging markets (REM) funding model was established in 2011. The main objective of the following study was to investigate whether the collaborations between agricultural industry players involved in the funding model, had been beneficial towards supporting the growth of black emerging farmers. The two funding approaches taken being, direct lending to individual farmers and the wholesale financing facility aimed at farmer groups, are explored in detail. The method of analysis adopted was mixed, comprising of a qualitative and quantitative approach. The quantitative approach was directed at the entire REM loan book, to obtain a view of the growth of the book over time; the performance of the loans and the level of non-performing loans within the book. The results thereof would be of interest given that emerging farmers were perceived to be of a high risk. The qualitative approach delved deeper into the relationship between the Land Bank and intermediaries which were tasked to provide end-to-end business support to the emerging farmers. The expected results would include an observation of the development and social impact, including skills development for the emerging farmers. The questionnaire completed by a sample of black emerging farmers, working with intermediaries revealed a few positive factors. The emerging farmers not only received technical support, but also developed a range of skills which are suited to operating a successful farm and running a profitable business. Although affected by the drought, the farmers were able to generate a profit and also create employment in their communities, thereby making a contribution towards a social impact, through their development. However the farmers also spoke out about the challenges they still encountered in the industry. The quantitative analysis displayed that the portion of the REM loan book which consisted of non-performing loans was a small percentage, relative to the performance of the entire loan book. Furthermore, the REM loan book had increased sizeably since its inception, reaching out to a wider scope of emerging farmers. Overall, the Land Bank's REM funding model was a success.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise-induced muscle damage caused by a 90 km ultramarathon on submaximal oxygen consumption and stride length. The experimental group consisted of 11 male runners (39.7 ± 9.3 years) competing in a 90 km ultramarathon. Ten male runners (41.0 ± 10.8 years) who did not run the 90 km ultramarathon formed the control group. Maximum oxygen consumption and peak treadmill running speed were measured two weeks before the ultramarathon. Daily measurements of muscle pain and plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity were recorded for seven days after the ultramarathon. Muscle pain, plasma CK activity, and blood lactate concentrations were recorded before, and oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and stride length were all measured during a 15-minute submaximal treadmill test seven days before the ultramarathon, and on days 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the ultramarathon. Peak blood lactate concentrations were determined 3 minutes after the completion of each treadmill test. Plasma CK activity and muscle pain remained significantly elevated in the experimental group for two days (p &amp;lt; 0.00002) and four days (p &amp;lt; 0.02) respectively after the ultramarathon. There was a significant increase in the post-submaximal treadmill test blood lactate concentrations, compared to pre-test values for each day (p &amp;lt; 0.00001). Submaximal oxygen consumption was significantly reduced in the experimental group for up to 28 days (p &amp;lt; 0.0004), and stride length was significantly reduced for 14 days (p &amp;lt; 0.05) after the ultramarathon. Furthermore, in the experimental group RER was significantly increased for up to seven days (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and RPE was significantly increased for up to four days (p &amp;lt; 0.04) after the ultramarathon. In conclusion, the decreased submaximal oxygen consumption following the ultramarathon may be interpreted as a positive training adaptation. However, other responses to the ultramarathon were not compatible with improved running performance. Furthermore, symptoms other than pain should be used to define the recovery period after an ultramarathon race.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Using the Internet to share content online is not only a daily activity for many people, yet a means to share their experiences and emotion with others. This study aims to answer why Internet users in South Africa share content online and to better understand the role of emotion in viral marketing. There are three main objectives of this study: to determine what encourages people to share content online, to investigate the role of emotion in sharing content online and to determine whether there is a difference between sharing content that elicits positive emotion versus sharing content that elicits negative emotion. The findings assist marketers in conducting viral marketing campaigns that appeal to consumers. Using a two-stage research design, qualitative and exploratory research was conducted. The first-stage is netnography, which is a derivation of ethnography, and was based on YouTube. The second-stage consisted of semi-structured interviews that included two viral video marketing campaigns. This study found that people share content online when content that appeals to people is relevant. Whether people find content relevant or not can depend on their age and/ or gender. People share content online to be altruistic, for self-benefit and social capital. An additional reason for sharing content online is when the content is emotionally appealing. Particularly, it was found that content that elicits positive emotion is more likely to be shared than content that elicits negative emotion. This study addresses gaps in literature in the following ways. Firstly, viral marketing is a growing concept that requires updated research about to provide an understanding of viral marketing that is consistent with its changes in its practice. Secondly, the model provided in this study defines what sharing means in terms of viral marketing, which no other study has done. Thirdly, where previous authors disagree about the difference between sharing content that elicits positive emotion versus sharing content that elicits negative emotion, this study contains updated findings which show that content which elicits positive emotion is more likely to be shared. Additionally, this study shows how the Social Sharing of Emotion theory can be applied to a viral-marketing and online context. The contribution that this study makes is that literature can benefit by understanding that content is king and relevance is important in encouraging people to share content online. Additionally, marketers should focus on creating content that is useful or makes the sender look good socially. Most importantly, to encourage people to share content online, the content should be emotionally appealing and focus should be placed on ensuring the content elicits positive emotion.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation seeks to explore the notion of &quot;trauma&quot; as a useful tool in the analysis of  literary texts. For this reason, aspects of psychological theory pertaining to trauma will be  applied to various Afrikaans texts. Horrelpoot (2006) by Eben Venter, as well as Equatoria  (2006) by Tom Dreyer will form the backbone of this analysis. Attention will also be paid to  the Heart of Darkness (by Joseph Conrad) intertext that appears in both. To expand the  analysis, a brief overview of trauma in three other literary texts will also be included. These  include Kennis van die Aand (1973) by Andre P Brink, Die Onsigbares (2003) by EKM  Didio and In Stede van die Liefde (2005) by Etienne van Heerden. The aim will be to  ascertain whether there is a generic way in which authors apply trauma within literary  texts, or whether there are different ways of implementing this theme in the novels.    Opsomming:  Hierdie verhandeling is daarop gemik om ondersoek in te stel of &quot;trauma&quot; 'n bruikbare  kategorie is in die analise van literere tekste. Die sielkundige teorie rakende trauma sal  dus toegepas word op verskeie Afrikaanse tekste. Die hooffokus sal op Horrelpoot (2006)  deur Eben Venter en Equatoria (2006) deur Tom Dreyer wees. Daar sal ook aandag gegee  word aan die Heart of Darkness (deur Joseph Conrad) as interteks in albei verhale. Om  die ondersoek uit te brei sal 'n bondige oorsig van trauma in drie ander Afrikaanse tekste  ook gegee word, naamlik Kennis van die Aand (1973) deur Andre P Brink, Die Onsigbares  (2003) deur EKM Didio en In Stede van die Liefde (2005) deur Etienne van Heerden. Daar  sal spesifiek gekyk word of die skrywers die trauma-gegewe op dieselfde manier gebruik  en of daar verskillende maniere is om met hierdie tematiek te werk te gaan.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Most research on 'Pentecostal/Charismatic' Churches in South Africa, though, examines reasons for their growth and related socio-economic development potential. Not one examines their response to HIV and AIDS specifically. Therefore, this dissertation seeks to answer two important questions: (1): How are Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches in the Western Cape responding to the HIV and AIDS pandemic? (2): What Policy Learning can be derived from the examination of these churches' responses to the HIV and AIDS pandemic in the Western Cape?</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Mathematical Modelling and Control System Development of a Remote Controlled, IMU Stabilised Hexapod Robot</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Walking robots are useful in search and rescue applications due to their ability to navigate uneven and complex terrain. A hexapod robot has been developed by the Robotics and Agents Research Lab at UCT, however multiple inadequacies have become evident. This work aims to produce a mathematical model of the hexapod and using this model, implement an effective control algorithm to achieve a smooth walking motion and overcome the original flaws. The mathematical model was integrated with the mechanical structure of the hexapod and controlled by a micro-controller. This micro-controller allows for a rapid start-up and low power consumption when compared to previous iterations of the hexapod. Using a path generation algorithm sets of foot positions and velocities are generated. Generating these points in real time allows for walking in any direction without any pre-defined foot positions. To enable attitude control of the hexapod body, an inertial measurement unit was added to the hexapod. By using a PID controller the IMU pitch and roll data was used to control a height offset of each foot of the hexapod, allowing for stabilisation of the hexapod body. An improved wireless remote control was developed to facilitate communication with a host computer. The remote system has a graphical user interface allowing for walking control and status information feedback, such as error information and current battery voltage. Walking tests have shown that the hexapod walks successfully with a smooth tripod gait using the path generation algorithm. Stabilisation tests have shown that the hexapod is capable of stabilising itself after a disturbance to its pitch and/or roll in ±2.5 seconds with a steady state error of ±0.001 radians. This proves that the hexapod robot can be controlled wirelessly while walking in any direction with a stabilised body. This is beneficial in search and rescue as the hexapod has a high degree of manoeuvrability to access areas too dangerous for rescuers to access. With cameras mounted on the stabilised body, it can be used to locate survivors in a disaster area and assist rescuers in recovering them with speed.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Heavy-flavour production at forward rapidity as a function of charged-particle multiplicity with ALICE at the LHC</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Heavy-flavour hadrons are hadrons made up of at least a charm or beauty heavy quark. They are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic collisions via hard scatterings and are important tools for studying different aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in hadronic collisions. Charged-particle multiplicity gives information on the global characteristics of the event and could be used to characterize particle production mechanisms. In hadronic collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, there is a significant contribution of Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision between nucleons. Therefore, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadrons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity gives insight into the mechanisms influencing their production in hadronic collisions at these energies and is a tool to test the influence of MPIs. Furthermore, charged-particle multiplicity dependence of heavy-flavour hadron production is used to test the ability of QCD theoretical models to reproduce data. In this thesis we investigate the production of heavy flavours via the single muon decay channel at forward rapidity as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity measured at central rapidity in proton-lead (p–Pb) collisions at √ sNN = 8.16 TeV using ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at the LHC. ALICE is a dedicated detector optimized to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions in which the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP - the state of matter which prevailed in the Early Universe shortly after the Big Bang) is created. ALICE also studies proton-proton (pp) and p–Pb collisions. In pp collisions, production cross sections obtained from data provide information used to test pQCD theories while in p–Pb collisions, where the energy density is believed to be too low to produce the QGP, the presence of additional nuclear matter can alter the wavefunction of the nucleus leading to modified observables - the so-called cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects. The study of the multiplicity dependence of heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions may give important information regarding initial-state effects in CNM. Both pp and p– Pb collisions provide reference for comparison with heavy-ion (Pb–Pb) collisions. ALICE measures hadrons, leptons, and photons up to very high transverse momentum (pT) ≈100 GeV/c. The detector consists of a central barrel, which covers a rapidity of |y| &lt; 1 and a Muon Spectrometer which covers the forward rapidity, -4 &lt; y &lt; -2.5. In this thesis, the production of heavy flavours via the contribution of their muonic decays to the inclusive pT-differential muon yield at forward (2.03 &lt; ycms &lt; 3.53) and backward (-4.46 &lt; ycms &lt; -2.96) rapidity reconstructed with the Muon Spectrometer and charged-particle multiplicity using the Silicon Pixel Detector located in the central barrel (|y| &lt;1) in p-Pb collisions at √ sNN = 8.16 TeV in the forward and backward rapidity are studied. The aim of the study is to probe the role of MPIs in the production of heavy flavours focusing on the contribution of hard and soft processes as well as to investigate effects of the presence of multiple binary nucleon-nucleon interactions and the initial state effects modified by CNM in particle production.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is an infectious disease considered to have great impact on public health due to its associated high mortality rates especially in sub Saharan Africa. Falciparum drugresistant strains, notably, to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Africa is traced mainly to Southeast Asia where artemisinin resistance rate is increasing. Although careful surveillance to monitor the emergence and spread of artemisinin-resistant parasite strains in Africa is on-going, research into new drugs, particularly, for African populations, is critical since there is no replaceable drug for artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) yet. Objective: The overall objective of this study is to identify potential protein targets through host–pathogen protein–protein functional interaction network analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms of drug failure and identify those essential targets that can play their role in predicting potential drug candidates specific to the African populations through a protein-based approach of both host and Plasmodium falciparum genomic analysis. Methods: We leveraged malaria-specific genome wide association study summary statistics data obtained from Gambia, Kenya and Malawi populations, Plasmodium falciparum selective pressure variants and functional datasets (protein sequences, interologs, host-pathogen intra-organism and host-pathogen inter-organism protein-protein interactions (PPIs)) from various sources (STRING, Reactome, HPID, Uniprot, IntAct and literature) to construct overlapping functional network for both host and pathogen. Developed algorithms and a large-scale data-driven computational framework were used in this study to analyze the datasets and the constructed networks to identify densely connected subnetworks or hubs essential for network stability and integrity. The host-pathogen network was analyzed to elucidate the influence of parasite candidate key proteins within the network and predict possible resistant pathways due to host-pathogen candidate key protein interactions. We performed biological and pathway enrichment analysis on critical proteins identified to elucidate their functions. In order to leverage disease-target-drug relationships to identify potential repurposable already approved drug candidates that could be used to treat malaria, pharmaceutical datasets from drug bank were explored using semantic similarity approach based of target–associated biological processes Results: About 600,000 significant SNPs (p-value&lt; 0.05) from the summary statistics data were mapped to their associated genes, and we identified 79 human-associated malaria genes. The assembled parasite network comprised of 8 clusters containing 799 functional interactions between 155 reviewed proteins of which 5 clusters contained 43 key proteins (selective variants) and 2 clusters contained 2 candidate key proteins(key proteins characterized by high centrality measure), C6KTB7 and C6KTD2. The human network comprised of 32 clusters containing 4,133,136 interactions between 20,329 unique reviewed proteins of which 7 clusters contained 760 key proteins and 2 clusters contained 6 significant human malaria-associated candidate key proteins or genes P22301 (IL10), P05362 (ICAM1), P01375 (TNF), P30480 (HLA-B), P16284 (PECAM1), O00206 (TLR4). The generated host-pathogen network comprised of 31,512 functional interactions between 8,023 host and pathogen proteins. We also explored the association of pfk13 gene within the host-pathogen. We observed that pfk13 cluster with host kelch–like proteins and other regulatory genes but no direct association with our identified host candidate key malaria targets. We implemented semantic similarity based approach complemented by Kappa and Jaccard statistical measure to identify 115 malaria–similar diseases and 26 potential repurposable drug hits that can be 3 appropriated experimentally for malaria treatment. Conclusion: In this study, we reviewed existing antimalarial drugs and resistance–associated variants contributing to the diminished sensitivity of antimalarials, especially chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin combination therapy within the African population. We also described various computational techniques implemented in predicting drug targets and leads in drug research. In our data analysis, we showed that possible mechanisms of resistance to artemisinin in Africa may arise from the combinatorial effects of many resistant genes to chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine. We investigated the role of pfk13 within the host–pathogen network. We predicted key targets that have been proposed to be essential for malaria drug and vaccine development through structural and functional analysis of host and pathogen function networks. Based on our analysis, we propose these targets as essential co-targets for combinatorial malaria drug discovery.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Thirty six consecutive patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 20 males median age 42 years, were studied in order to define prognostic variables and determine the influence of surgery on outcome. Presentation was usually with insidious cholestasis or recurrent cholangitis. Twenty six patients (72 per cent) had associated inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis 20, Crohn's disease 2, unclassified 4). Thirty two patients were followed prospectively for up to nine years. Twenty three remained either stable or had slowly progressive disease. Of the remaining nine patients, seven died (five from end-stage liver failure and two from cholangiocarcinoma) and two patients underwent liver transplantation. Actuarial survival at five years was 52 per cent. A raised serum bilirubin concentration was the only variable at presentation that independently predicted a poor outcome. Cholangiograms were available for detailed assessment in thirty PSC patients. Neither the extent of biliary involvement nor the presence of surgical correctable (&quot;dominant&quot;) strictures in the extrahepatic ductal system were of prognostic importance. Six patients who developed obstructive jaundice associated with advanced liver disease underwent surgical drainage operations for dominant biliary strictures, but this did not seem to prevent progression of the disease. Two patients who progressed to end-stage liver disease went on to liver transplantation and were alive with functioning grafts at seven and fourteen months respectively. Nine patients with asymptomatic PSC were followed prospectively for up to twelve years. None of these patients developed overt liver disease but serum bilirubin levels became mildly elevated in two patients. It is concluded that symptomatic PSC is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Patients with advanced liver disease due to PSC should be considered directly for liver transplantation. In contrast, asymptomatic PSC patients may remain symptom-free for many years.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Blood glucose control with intravenous insulin therapy is one of the most frequently used treatment modalities to manage hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients. Almost all critically ill patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will require blood glucose control to manage stress induced hyperglycaemia. Blood glucose control by means of intravenous insulin therapy is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality rates, which ultimately improves patient care outcomes. Although blood glucose control is beneficial for critically ill patients, however, it is potentially dangerous due to the side effects of insulin therapy, namely hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. As ICU professional nurses are responsible for blood glucose control in critically ill patients, it is therefore essential that they have adequate knowledge of blood glucose control measures to ensure patient safety and improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine ICU professional nursesâ€™ knowledge of blood glucose physiology and blood glucose control in critically ill adult patients in a public tertiary hospital in the Western Cape Province. The study was non-experimental, descriptive and quantitative in nature. Data was collected by means of an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire in June 2013. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the University of Cape Townâ€™s Health Sciences Faculty Human Research Ethics Committee. Permission to conduct the study in the specific research setting was obtained from the Hospital Senior Medical Services Manager. Descriptive and correlational statistics were used to analyse the data.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The high adoption of mobile phones coupled with 3G technology can extend Internet access to new communities. Yet such access is currently impractical because mobile phone interfaces are cumbersome to use. In addition, hierarchical menus and search engines pose an interaction barrier to the unfamiliar. A content recommender is proposed to address these issues. Collaborative filtering is a technique developed to make predictions on unobserved items based on the preferences of similar users. User-based collaborative filtering has been identified as a simple, yet reasonably accurate scheme. An evaluation is conducted into how quickly this algorithm can identify preferred content based on user-content interactions.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Palliative care developed as a response to the specific needs experienced by terminally ill cancer patients and their families. The modern palliative care movement began in London in 1967 and African palliative care developed against this backdrop. The HIV pandemic has confronted African palliative care workers with new challenges to provide accessible, affordable, culturally sensitive care in resource limited settings. The domains of palliative care are well recognised and the provision of holistic patient centered care requires that the individual context of each person requiring palliative care is considered as these influenced the experience of life-threatening illness. The HIV burden in South Africa is complicated by other health care issues, poverty, and the implications of a multi-cultural, multi-racial society which add to the complexities of palliative care service provision. This study considered the individual context and palliative care needs of a group of HIV positive patients who access palliative care from Grahamstown Hospice.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study deals with aspects of the grammatical structure of nominal expressions in Spanish, examined within the broad frame of notions, principles and assumptions constituting the Minimalist Program (MP). A central concern of the study is the major theoretical reconceptualization of nominal structure known as the DP Hypothesis, an analysis of nominal expressions as being headed by D, rather than by N, as in the traditional analysis. The most important proposals in support of this hypothesis are set out and critically reviewed, and then reinterpreted in minimalist terms where necessary.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Ischaemic necrosis of bone, particularly of the femoral head appears to be an increasing cause of musculoskeletal disability in relatively young people (Hungerford 1981). The disease is usually progressive, resulting in the destruction of major weight-bearing joints requiring arthrodesis or arthroplasty. A decade ago it was hoped that joint replacement would solve most of these problems, however, failure of such arthroplasties have often been associated with catastrophic consequences (Chandler 1979).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a common complication of total laryngectomy. We hypothesised that perioperative proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment could reduce the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistulae. This prospective placebo-controlled double-blind randomised controlled trial compared PPI treatment (14 days enteral omeprazole) with a placebo in patients undergoing primary total laryngectomy. The incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula was recorded.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A qualitative study of adaptation after deterioration in function in the elderly</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The group studied were elderly people who had recently experienced an unexpected deterioration in their functioning, and who seemed to be coping well. It has been noted in the literature that many elderly continue to &quot;age well&quot; despite a setback to their health. The aim of this study was to understand and describe factors that participants had found useful in adapting to deterioration in health, so as to inform others going through a similar process, and health care workers who work with the elderly. This was a qualitative study conducted in a General Practice setting in Southern Suburbs of Cape Town. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted. These were recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. Analysis revealed a Core Theme, &quot;In search of a new normal life&quot;, which described a process of transformation of aspects of themselves which participants needed to undergo in order to successfully deal with their new circumstances. Additionally, four Themes were identified that facilitated this transformation. These were &quot;Groundwork&quot; (preparation for old age), &quot;Support&quot; (family, friends and accepting help) , &quot;Spirituality&quot; (religious as well as existential wellbeing) and &quot;Character&quot; (key traits and attitudes). Overall, this study suggested that in order to continue to &quot;successfully age&quot; when health fails, a process of transformation of self seems to be necessary. Furthermore, it identified facilitating factors that may be able to be taught and learned. Importantly, the study also highlighted the shortcomings of the prevalent &quot;Pathological Model&quot; of health with respect to care of the elderly. The following implications for practice in caring for the elderly emerged from this study. One: Health care practitioners need to look beyond the biomedical model and remember the importance of spiritual, social and psychological dimensions that contribute towards living a meaningful life in older age. Two: Health care practitioners need to be aware of a transformative process that the elderly undergo in dealing with deteriorating function, and to assist in this process. Further research in this area to develop practical interventions, is recommended. Three: Based on the factors identified that facilitate transformation, health care practitioners need to educate their younger patients about what measures they can put in place to prepare for older age.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Hydrocarbons and Russian foreign policy in the post-communist era (1991-2008): A case study.</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Jeffery, Jared</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>Politics, Philosophy and Economics</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This thesis aims to analyse the effect of hydrocarbons on Russian foreign policy in the post-communist period. In doing so it employs a constructivist meta-theory (actorstructure framework) and Susan Strange's approach to international political economy (IPE). The role of hydrocarbons in both the international political economy and Russia's domestic political economy is analysed. Thereafter a historical narrative outlining the affect of hydrocarbons on foreign policy from 1991-2008 is offered. There is also a brief focus on the role of Gazprom in Russian foreign policy. It is found that hydrocarbons affected Russian foreign policy through the impact they had on the state's ability to control the domestic political economy (which was diminished in the 1991-1999 period, but strengthened as international oil prices rose thereafter). Hydrocarbons, though a source of power, are also found to tie the Russian state to the interdependent international political economy of the globalised era. The analysis finds that the case supports the constructivist emphasis on the importance of understanding domestic issues when addressing the foreign policies of states. It also finds that the approaches used, Wendt's constructivism and Strange's IPE theory, work well in conjunction to illuminate foreign policy issues. A criticism of Strange's approach, however, is highlighted. She fails to give adequate attention to matters of geography in her model. This, it is argued, would be a fruitful endeavour for future IPE analysis, especially if addressed through the case of hydrocarbons in the IPE.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Mathematical modelling of agglomerate scale phenomena in heap bioleaching</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Bioleaching is a naturally occurring process that has been harnessed in metal recovery from low grade ores. The heap bioleaching technique involves complex interactions between chemical reactions, microbial processes and transport processes. The need for efficient heap operations has led to the scientific investigation of heap bioleaching and the development of mathematical models for the process. Over time, the focus of heap leach modelling has moved from models that emphasize particle scale processes to models that emph8size bulk scale processes. In many cases however, the particle scale effects in these bulk scale models are quite simplified. This thesis aims to provide a means for the systematic integration of particle (or micro-) scale processes into bulk (or macro-) scale models for heap bioleaching, by the development of an intermediate (or meso-) scale &quot;agglomerate&quot; model. The agglomerate is defined as a unit volume of a heap that comprises a solid phase (a size distribution of ore particles), a liquid phase (stagnant and flowing leaching solution, which contains dissolved solutes, attached and planktonic microbes) and a gas phase (flowing air and air pockets). The processes incorporated into the proposed model include reagent diffusion and ree1ction in a s.ze distribution of ore particles, microbial attachment, detachment and oxidation processes, and the transport of chemical and microbial species to and from the agglomerate. Isothermal agglomerate conditions, and a uniform distribution of reagents in the stagnant liquid phase, are among the modelling assumptions made. The agglomerate model is applied to investigate the meso-scale bioleaching of a theoretical case study ore that contains mainly chalcocite and pyrite, in the presence of iron oxidizing microbes. The numerical implementation of the model is done in the Python programming language. The integrity of the numerical results is confirmed by performing mass balance checks at the end of each simulation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In 21st century post-colonial Africa, African leaders have visualised, mobilised, and worked towards economic advancement nationally, regionally, and continentally. In the past 60 or more years there has been a concentration on regional integration as to achieve economic growth and increase global competitiveness. More recently, intra-African trade has emerged as an essential component of continental economic advancement. However, there have been many obstacles that have hindered intra-African trade from achieving its potential and functioning in a way that truly benefits the continent. This dissertation will examine the effect that some of those challenges and obstacles (including border issues, documentation, and the lack of essential infrastructure), have had on intra-African trade.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Subjective-Objective-Subjective: The Science Of Propaganda</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Private Law</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This thesis discusses the following: 1. That, while advertising practitioners employ various levels of scientific endeavour (particularly strategic insight development, but also research, demographic data collection, and other objective tools of the trade), its final output is ultimately nonscientific, i.e. subjective creative ideation. (In this way, advertising is not dissimilar to the classic ‘art' of propaganda.) 2. That, for reasons of business necessity, creative ego and a latent form of ‘inferiority complex' the advertising industry describes its work in presentations to more scientifically-orientated clients as a more scientific proposition. 3. That, in contrast, as evidenced by the physical production process of the advertising idea (post the client presentation) – as well as in industry texts, award ceremonies, and selected case studies – advertising practitioners effectively acknowledge the subjective nature of their work. 4. That further evidence of this scientific ‘terministic screen' (Burke 1950, pp. 26-27) is also revealed in the failure of some television commercials to profitably ‘connect' as intended with an audience – thus undermining claims to the objective approach that preceded these commercials. 5. That, possibly, as is implied in at least one ethnographic case study, not even clients are necessarily convinced by advertising science: the ‘screen' may be a two-way mirror. 6. That there is, more broadly, a constant dialectic between right-brained creativity and the left-brained business project. 7. That this tension is a microcosm of the capitalist enterprise, and, in an increasing number of present examples, is perversely reflected in the advertising industry's output as anti-capitalist brand messaging. 8. That it is possible to think of advertising as a sub-set of a more consumer-orientated ‘design'. 6 9. That, admittedly within limited confines of my research, there is a tantalising indication that, generally, advertising artefacts were historically more logos-led, are currently more pathos-led, and may in future benefit from a more ethos-led orientation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Bad weather conditions such as drought have had detrimental effects on the agrarian life of the people in Madziva rural area, Zimbabwe. Due to the unfavorable weather conditions in this area, poverty and unemployment, most men migrated and continue to migrate to the urban areas in search of greener pastures. This research focuses on how these more frequent extreme weather conditions in Madziva, resulting in less predictable seasons, have increased incidences of precarity. This is important as it portrays how the climate has changed, its effect and the anxiety and expectations around it. Furthermore, providing perception of the nature of climate change in the village is important in order to assess the evidence of nature and level of climate change (manifesting through drought). As a result of the uncertainty caused by drought, the migration of men had been rampant in Madziva, and thus the village is characterized by a significant number of female-led households. To understand the social, political and economic dynamics of what it means to survive in a time of drought for ‘fragmented' families, an ethnographic research was conducted in Madziva over two months (14 June 2017 to 15 July 2017) and (10 December 2017 to 11 January 2018) during one of the worst droughts in Zimbabwe. This research follows the everyday lives of eight women and the interactions with 15 more women through focus group interviews in order to understand the strategies used to achieve survival. In this thesis, the results of an ethnography of women's experience of drought particularly in Madziva rural area in Zimbabwe between June 2017 and mid-January to mid-February 2018 are presented. It further explores, the locals' understandings of extreme weather conditions particularly in Madziva rural area and how practices, particularly those linked to gender, are shaped or reinforced. This research found out that the people of Madziva rural area, particularly women are severely affected by drought as compared to men. This is because of the expectations of managing the household and caring for children which requires them to be heavily reliant on natural resources. The reliance on natural resources has been due to the very poor and non-performing Zimbabwean economy, however, these are the resources which become scarce in a time of drought, which exacerbates precarity. Additionally, women in rural areas such as Madziva have less access to critical information on shifts in cropping patterns and weather alerts, and this can be linked to the gendered structure of the village, where men are seen as the principle holders of knowledge of the land. Furthermore, women also have very little power in decision making and access to resources because of the land ownership titles often given to the men of the household. However, with iv the high migration to urban centers, there is a gap that the women of Madziva must navigate and this thesis aims to explore how this occurs. For instance, during the fieldwork, it became evident that irrespective of all these challenges that are caused by drought, women are always expected to make a plan to provide for their families although there is a stiff competition for the remaining natural resources. Women in Madziva negotiated relationships of marginality, responsibility, togetherness and belonging through the ways they experienced the challenges ushered by drought.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Mining sites are often located in rural and remote communities where healthcare services are either unaffordable or unavailable to mine employees. To address this problem, mining companies may elect to establish and manage mine hospitals to provide vital healthcare services to their employees and the surrounding communities. Mining companies often have the financial capacity to establish state-of-the-art facilities with medical equipment and technology required for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including diseases prevalent in the mining industry. The role of mine hospitals extends beyond the development of health infrastructure and the provision of healthcare services. Mine hospitals contribute to the economic development of mine-affected communities. Mine hospitals create employment opportunities that increase disposable income in mine-affected communities and boost local economic activities. Additionally, mining companies can promote local procurement by purchasing goods and services needed for their mine hospitals from local suppliers. Notwithstanding the positive socio-economic impacts of mine hospitals in mineaffected communities, the closure or ownership and management transfer of mine hospitals can have adverse effects on mine-affected communities. These adverse effects include the poor management of mine hospitals, the termination or suspension of healthcare services, and job losses. Therefore, responsible mine hospital closure and transfer practices must be implemented by mining companies to prevent or minimise these adverse effects. This minor dissertation examines the history, role, and function of mine hospitals in mine-affected communities in South Africa. It evaluates the positive and negative (specifically mine hospital closures and ownership and management transfers) impacts of mine hospitals on mine-affected communities. Based on the role and function of mine hospitals and their impacts on mine-affected communities, the dissertation recommends that certain aspects of mine hospitals are governed differently from general private hospitals and standard workplace-based systems. It proposes specific legislative requirements and procedures for the establishment, ownership and management transfer; and closure of mine hospitals. Additionally, the dissertation makes recommendations on the roles of the government, mining companies, and mine-affected communities in the establishment, transfer, and closure processes.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In the early 1990s, a new model emerged for the provision of electricity generation across developing regions. The model involved private sector participation in the form of independent power projects (IPP). Driving this change in business was insufficient public finance from host country governments, a reduction in concessionary loans from multilateral and bilateral development institutions, and a push for improved efficiency in a state-owned utility sector that was considered to be underperforming. This dissertation reviews how IPPs developed across both North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis focuses on the extent to which positive development outcomes (viz. reliable and affordable power) and investment outcomes (viz. favourable investment returns and the opportunity to grow investments) were both achieved. The dissertation posits that balancing development and investment outcomes leads to greater sustainability for projects. It further explores a range of elements that contribute to the success of projects, namely: the investment climate; policy, regulatory and planning frameworks; competitive procurement practices; availability of competitively procured fuel; favourable debt and equity arrangements, including new trends in the nature of IPP firms and credit enhancement arrangements; and new risk management techniques. In-depth case studies of IPP experiences in Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania are used to explore the question of balancing outcomes and sustainability. Reviews of IPP experiences in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia also supplement the analysis together with an evaluation of the foreign direct investment context and related theory. Framing the whole discussion is an examination of how the new model for electric power provision evolved and how power sector reform models need to be adjusted to better reflect the reality in developing countries and emerging economies.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A hydrodynamic study of nickel suspension in stirred tanks</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Many studies on solid-liquid mixing have been dedicated to low density particles at low solids concentrations. In the present work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and experimental methods were employed to study suspension of high density particles (nickel) at high solids concentration in water. The work first focused on establishing the velocity field in a liquid-only system and then progressed to a solid-liquid system. In the liquid-only system, the influence of tank geometry and simulation strategies, including turbulence models, on fluid flow pattern and mixing was investigated in a tank stirred by a Rushton turbine. The standard k-f. model gave better overall predictions of mean velocity fields than the k-ro and RNG k-f. models. The CFD simulation and experimental results obtained with the laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) method showed that mixing time and homogenization energy decreased with a decrease in the impeller bottom clearance. It was further shown that there is a bottom clearance range in which a draft tube can aid mixing in a tank stirred by the Rushton turbine. In the solid-liquid system, a hydrofoil impeller was used to investigate the influence of simulation strategies, particle properties and hydrodynamic operating conditions on mixing features such as the off-bottom solids suspension, cloud height, solids concentration distribution and local particle size distribution. The simulation results were compared with experimental ones, in which the off-bottom solids suspension was determined visually and an optical attenuation technique was employed to determine the cloud height and solids concentration distribution. The local particle size distribution (PSD) in the tank was measured by a laser diffraction method. A better agreement between the simulation and experimental results was obtained with drag models that account for the solids loading or free stream turbulence than those that do not. It was shown that the Stokes law applies up to a diameter of 150 ~m for the nickel particles. A CFD simulation strategy for studying mixing of high density solids is proposed and it is shown that a CFD simulation method can be used to develop empirical models that predict mixing features. A CFD simulation approach that takes particle size into account gives predictions that are more representative of practical applications than the mono-size particle simulation approach. Reactor configurations and hydrodynamic parameters that improve mixing were identified. These can also aid optimal design of mixing systems.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This contribution argues for the augmentation of the list of prohibited contract terms in s 51 of the South African Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008, and draws on comparative research. It discusses terms which should be prohibited outright, whereas they are currently on the list of presumptively unfair terms in reg 44 of the Consumer Protection Act Regulations (the “orange list” or “grey list”). It also considers terms which should remain on the orange list.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A study comparing outcomes of appendectomy between HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: The high prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has added a new dimension to the management and outcomes of many general surgical conditions in South Africa. However, there is a paucity of data describing the impact of HIV status on surgical outcomes in our setting. Appendicitis is the most common gastrointestinal emergency, and its surgical outcomes in areas of high HIV prevalence are poorly described in the literature. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe and compare the outcomes of appendectomy between HIV-infected (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) patients. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing appendectomy at a large regional hospital over a 12-month period. Demographic data, duration of pre-hospital symptoms, HIV status, surgical approach, operative findings, histopathology reports, hospital stay and complications were recorded. Data for the HIV+ and HIV-patient cohorts were then described, analysed and compared. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-Squared or Fisher's exact test for non-continuous variables, and non- parametric ANOVA and Wilcoxon ranked sum test for continuous variables. A P-value less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The study group comprised 134 patients; 18 (13.4 %) tested positive for HIV. HIV+ patients were significantly older (mean age of 29.3 vs. 20.3 years, P= 0.002) and had longer duration of pre-hospital symptoms (mean of 3.94 vs. 2.57 days, P= 0.03). Postoperative complications (44.4 % vs. 17.2 %, P= 0.03) and lengthier hospital stays (7.28 days vs. 5.95 days, P= 0.004) were also more frequently seen in the HIV+ patients. There were no differences in appendiceal rupture rates, histopathological findings and mortality. Conclusion: HIV infection is common in patients admitted with clinical features of acute appendicitis in South Africa. Presentation in HIV+ patients was delayed, and surgery was associated with significant postoperative morbidity and longer hospital stay.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Explanation for defeasible entailment</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Explanation facilities are an essential part of tools for knowledge representation and reasoning systems. Knowledge representation and reasoning systems allow users to capture information about the world and reason about it. They are useful in understanding entailments which allow users to derive implicit knowledge that can be made explicit through inferences. Additionally, explanations also assist users in debugging and repairing knowledge bases when conflicts arise. Understanding the conclusions drawn from logic-based systems are complex and requires expert knowledge, especially when defeasible knowledge bases are taken into account for both expert and general users. A defeasible knowledge base represents statements that can be retracted because they refer to information in which there are exceptions to stated rules. That is, any defeasible statement is one that may be withdrawn upon learning of an exception. Explanations for classical logics such as description logics which are well-known formalisms for reasoning about information in a given domain are provided through the notion of justifications. Simply providing or listing the statements that are responsible for an entailment in the classical case is enough to justify an entailment. However, when looking at the defeasible case where entailed statements can be retracted, this is not adequate because the way in which entailment is performed is more complicated than the classical case. In this dissertation, we combine explanations with a particular approach to dealing with defeasible reasoning. We provide an algorithm to compute justification-based explanations for defeasible knowledge bases. It is shown that in order to accurately derive justifications for defeasible knowledge bases, we need to establish the point at which conflicts arise by using an algorithm to come up with a ranking of defeasible statements. This means that only a portion of the knowledge is considered because the statements that cause conflicts are discarded. The final algorithm consists of two parts; the first part establishes the point at which the conflicts occur and the second part uses the information obtained from the first algorithm to compute justifications for defeasible knowledge bases.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Heat exchangers and steam headers are at the heart of any boiler and are susceptible to a range of failures including tube leaks, ligament cracking, creep and fatigue. These common forms of header failure mechanisms can be exacerbated by local thermal stresses due to temperature and flow maldistribution at full and partial boiler load operations. The purpose of this project is to develop process models of the outlet stubbox header of a final superheater (FSH) heat exchanger in a 620MW coal-fired drum type boiler. The process models were used to assess the impact of steam flow and temperature distribution on the thermal stresses in the header material. The process models were developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Thermocouples were installed at key locations on the stubbox headers to monitor metal temperatures and the measured metal temperatures served as boundary values and for validation of the CFD results. The thermocouple data was analysed for three different steady state boiler loads, namely full load, 80% load and 60% load. It showed that the temperature distribution across these headers was not uniform, with a maximum temperature difference across the outlet stubbox of 40℃ at full load and 43℃ at partial loads. Other relevant power plant data, such as steam pressure, was provided from the power plant's Distributed Control System (DCS) and was used as boundary conditions for the CFD models. The exact mass flow distribution across the inlet stubs of the outlet stubbox header was unknown and was estimated using a CFD model of the inlet stubbox header and steam mass flow values from power plant's DCS system. A CFD model was created for each of the three boiler loads at steady state conditions. The CFD results provided the metal temperature profile, internal steam temperature distribution and pressure distribution across the header. The CFD solid temperatures were validated using the thermocouple readings and found to be in agreement. The CFD results were exported to the FEA models, where specific displacement constraints for thermal expansion were utilised. The FEA models were used to assess the extent of thermal stresses due to thermal expansion only, as well as stresses due to thermal expansion combined with internal pressure. High local stresses were found at the borehole crotch corners of the rear outlet branch and inlet stubs. However, these are below 0.2% proof strength at elevated temperatures. The high local stresses thus did not result in local plastic deformation but contribute to exacerbate steady state failure mechanisms such as creep.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The embryonic source and chemical nature of those factor/s directing the in vivo differentiation of melanocytes from crest cells are as yet unknown. To begin to address this issue, it is important to establish exactly when and where these signa/s first exert their effects. Therefore, in the present study, overtly differentiated melanocytes containing melanin were quantitated in developing Black Australorp X New Hampshire Red chick embryos. In contrast to previous studies, it was found that embryos synthesize melanin from as early as Day 5 of development, and that at this stage, the melanocytes are predominantly dermally located. Between 5 and 8 days, the numbers of both dermal and epidermal melanocytes increase, after which the dermal melanocyte population declines rapidly while the number of epidermal melanocytes continues to increase. These findings suggest that premelanocytes do not have to be epidermally located to initiate terminal differentiation and implicate the dermis as a possible source of melanocyte inducing factor/s. The next step was to examine stages of development prior to the onset of pigment production. For this reason, tyrosinase was purified for use as antigen in the production of a polyclonal antibody. The antibody was tested for specificity by western blotting, - immunocytochemistry and immunoinhibition procedures. Lack of specificity was demonstrated, rendering it unsuitable as an antibody marker for early melanocytes. Fowl melanocytes are thought to differentiate into either eumelanosome- or pheomelanosome synthesizing cells. To test the validity of this concept, embryonic skin of the red/black cross breed were screened for possible mixed type melanocytes by electron microscopy. The melanocytes contained melanosomes with a matrix of irregularly arranged filaments amongst typical eumelanogenic melanosomes. This suggests that these chick melanocytes may synthesize both eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes in single cells. In a further study on pure breeding New Hampshire Reds, it was found that the melanocytes contained a mixture of typical and less typical pheomelanosomes. Outer membrane indentations in the latter melanosome type suggest that tyrosinase may enter these pheomelanosomes by a mechanism related to that proposed for the melanosomes of goldfish.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Capital flight and the role of exchange rates in Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The problem of capital flight presents an interesting paradox towards capital accumulation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though Africa has been labelled as &quot;the rising continent&quot; by various researchers, we continue to see capital flight and its adverse effects extend beyond the lack of domestic investment capital, to sluggish economic growth and disquieting poverty rates. This paradox highlights the importance of understanding the drivers of capital flight from Africa. Among the many postulated determinants, this study investigates the effect of the exchange rate on capital flight using 3 case studies from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia for the period 1970 to 2010 . By employing Granger's (1969) causality test, we investigate the causal relation between capital flight and the exchange rate. We further use the Johansen (1988) Method of Cointegration to determine the existence of a long run relationship and estimate a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to determine the short run dynamics. Our granger causality test results suggest that the direction of causality between capital flight and the real exchange rate only holds in the period under analysis and therefore, it should not be assumed to hold in different time periods. Our main findings suggest that capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia is habitually motivated by portfolio considerations. We find that capital flight from Nigeria and South Africa is driven by expected currency depreciation while capital flight from Zambia is driven by expected currency appreciation in the long run. Our other findings suggest that other macroeconomic policy errors in the form of inflation unpredictability and foreign direct investment also increase capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia. We also find that political factors have a significant role in determining capital flight from Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia. We however find inconclusive evidence of the short run effects in all three countries. It is recommended that the imposition of efficient exchange controls can curb capital flight when implemented concurrently with effective macroeconomic management practices by the fiscal authorities.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Professional rugby union is a contact sport with a high risk of injury. The Super Rugby competition is a particularly demanding 16-week Southern Hemisphere tournament. In this tournament, 15 teams compete and play international level matches every week, which may be associated with an even higher risk of injuries. The main objectives of this dissertation were 1) to review the epidemiology and risk factors of injuries in professional rugby union, with specific reference to the Super Rugby tournament (Part 1), and 2) to document the incidence and nature of time-loss injuries during the 2012 Super Rugby tournament (Part 2). Part 1: In this component of the dissertation, a comprehensive review of injuries during Super Rugby was undertaken. A search revealed only 3 studies that have been conducted during this competition. Therefore additional data were included from other studies on Rugby Union, where appropriate. Part 2: This component of the dissertation consists of a prospective cohort study that was conducted during the 2012 Super Rugby tournament, in which teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa participated. Participants consisted of 152 players from five South African teams. Team physicians collected daily injury data through a secure, webbased electronic platform. Data included the size of the squad, the type of day, main player position, whether it was a training or match injury, hours of play (training and matches), the time of the match injury, the mechanism of the injury, the main anatomical location of the injury, the specific anatomical structure of the injury, the type of injury, and the severity of the injury (days lost).</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A retrospective description of primary immunodeficiency diseases at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, 1975 – 2017</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background. The primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) constitute a diverse and everexpanding group of inborn errors affecting a wide range of immune functions. They are not well documented in Sub-Saharan Africa. An important barrier to care is limited awareness of PIDs and their management among health care professionals. This fascinating spectrum of diseases is rapidly expanding worldwide, and not as rare as we think. Genetic characterization and newborn screening for primary Immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) may be the gold standard in the first world setting but are neither practical nor feasible for our doctors. Yet, other low and middle income countries in the world have also established reasonable services and created registries for children with PIDs, including other African countries. Objective. To describe the spectrum of PIDs at a tertiary paediatric hospital. Methods. A retrospective descriptive study of PIDs diagnosed at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa between 1975 and 2017 was undertaken. Results. 252 children with PIDs were identified, spanning 8 of the 9 categories listed in the 2017 classification of the International Union of Immunological Societies. Predominantly antibody deficiencies, combined immunodeficiencies with associated syndromic features, and immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity accounted for 79% of all PIDs. The mean age (standard deviation) at diagnosis was 46 (50) months and the male to female ratio was 1.5:1. A history of parental consanguinity was present in 3 children (1.2%). Recurrent infection was the most prevalent presenting phenotype, manifesting in 70.2% of the patients. Genetic or chromosomal confirmation was obtained in 42/252 (16.7%) of the children. Common interventions used to prevent infection were antimicrobial prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy, administered to 37.7% and 36.9% of the patients respectively. Six of seven children who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had successful outcomes. The 7th patient died 2 months post-HSCT from overwhelming infection. Although we could not account for the children lost to follow up during the study period, 53 (21.0%) deaths were confirmed. Conclusions. Several challenges exist in the recognition and treatment of children with PIDs in our setting. These include limited access to genetic diagnostics and HSCT. Sub-optimal treatment options contribute to the overall mortality of PIDs in South Africa. Greater awareness among clinicians treating children and more laboratory diagnostic capacity are needed to increase the recognition PIDs among children in South Africa. The treatment options that are available in South Africa are unevenly distributed. Hence, treatment capacity should be expanded throughout the country, especially advanced interventions such as HSCT. Ongoing reporting of registries such as ours and increased community awareness should strengthen the lobby for greater investment in rare diseases such as the PIDs.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background. Common mental disorders (CMDs), including depression and anxiety disorders, and risky alcohol use are highly prevalent among people living with HIV. Yet, many studies have found that most people who suffer from mental disorders do not receive treatment, especially in low-income countries. Given people living with HIV frequent health services, this represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment that could improve physical and mental health outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify missed opportunities to address mental health of people living with HIV in Malawi. Four types of missed opportunities were operationalised for this study. The first two address missed opportunities for screening or identification For missed opportunity #1, a respondent had to screen positive for mental health problem (depression/anxiety or alcohol use ; and in any of their visits to the clinic in the past 12 months, the clinical officer or nurse did not ask about their mental health. Missed opportunity definition #2 was a more nuanced missed opportunity for identification of probable mental health problems. A respondent had to be undetected for mental health problems; and in any of his or her visits to the clinic in the past 12 months, the clinical officer or nurse did not ask about his or her mental health and s/he wanted to receive advice or treatment about his or her mental health problems. The second to definitions address missed opportunities for treatment. For missed opportunity definition #3, a respondent had to screen positive for mental health problem and if in any of his or her visits to the clinic in the past 12 months, and s/he did not receive advice or treatment. For missed opportunity definition #4, a more nuanced missed opportunity for the treatment of probable mental health problem: a respondent had to screen positive for a mental health problem; s/he wanted to receive advice or treatment about his or her mental health problems/alcohol use; and in any of their visits to the clinic in the past 12 months, s/he did not receive treatment for a mental disorder/risky alcohol use. Methods. A a random of participants receiving HIV care were approached while they were waiting for their consultation at three ART clinics namely: Tisungane, Matawale and Domasi. Those who consented to participants were interviewed in a private room. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were used to detect probable cases of CMDs and clients consuming alcohol at risky levels. Following v administration of the SRQ-20 and AUDIT, participants were asked if clinical officers (COs) or nurses inquired about their feelings (sad or worried) or alcohol consumption during their routine visits to ART clinics, thus eliciting data on identification by healthcare workers or identification of CMD symptoms. The participants were also asked whether advice or treatment was recommended and whether they would have liked to receive advice or treatment regarding their feelings or risky alcohol use. Descriptive statistics were utilized to calculate prevalence estimates of missed opportunities and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with missed opportunities for mental health service provision. Results. The study had 382 participants. The proportion of participants who screened at risk was 77 (20.2%) for probable CMDs and 16 (4.2%) for risky alcohol use. The proportion of participants who screened at risk for any mental health problem (depression, anxiety and risky alcohol use) was 87 (22.8%). Participants who were asked by clinical officers and nurses about CMD symptoms and alcohol use were 92 (24.1%) and 89 (23.3%) respectively. Of the entire sample, 351 (91.9%) participants wanted to receive advice or treatment and 26 (29.9%) received advice or treatment. Missed opportunities to address the mental health of people living with HIV were found to be as follows: definition #1, 40 participants (46.0%); definition #2, 35 participants (40.2%); definition #3, 87 participants (100%) and definition #4, 66 participants (75.9%). After adjusting for other variables in the model female gender was significantly associated with missed opportunity definition #1. After adjusting for other variables in the model female participants were more likely to meet criteria for missed opportunity definition #2 than male participants. Furthermore, older participants were less likely to meet criteria for missed opportunity definition #2 compared to younger participants. Participants who were employed were less likely to meet criteria for missed opportunity definition #2. In the same vein, participants who were spending less were less likely to meet criteria for missed opportunity definition #2. Given all participants met criteria, we were unable to develop logistic regression models. There were no significant associations for missed opportunity definition #4. Conclusion. Approximately one fifth of the sample recruited screened at risk for CMDs and most clients wanted to receive advice or treatment. Despite over 40% of the participants reporting being asked about CMD symptoms, PHC workers did not provide advice or treatments to 75.9% of clients. There is need to advocate for screening of mental health problems including alcohol use and treatment in all ART clinics in Malawi.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>High disease morbidity coupled with limited healthcare personnel places the health sector in Kenya under strain, leaving parts of the population with limited access to health services. Electronic health (eHealth), the utilisation of information and communication technologies in healthcare, is an innovation with the potential to improve access to health services. Several examples exist of eHealth projects being undertaken in Kenya. However, eHealth solutions have been poorly adopted in the public healthcare sector, which has partly been blamed on lack of knowledge amongst healthcare providers and patients. The aim of this study was to examine how knowledge is exchanged between the stakeholders currently active within the eHealth implementation space in the Kenyan public sector. The results of the study would aid in identifying communication breakdowns and ways of increasing information flow with regard to eHealth, and ultimately would aid strategies to help improve the uptake of eHealth within the public sector. A mixed methods study was undertaken that combined quantitative social network analysis and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with stakeholders involved in implementation of eHealth projects in Kenya. Publications on implementation of eHealth projects in Kenya from 2001 to 2018 were used to obtain data on relevant organisations. Social network analysis was used to identify prominent actors. Individuals working within such organisations were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Further social network analysis was applied to data gathered through the interviews. Foreign universities and foreign not-for-profit organisations were the most commonly identified organisations in the networks generated. The tacit nature of knowledge within networks, low research capacity and output, information guarding, geographical distance between collaborating organisations, and low cohesion were some of the factors found to inhibit knowledge diffusion within the eHealth implementation space in Kenya. The search for capacity and funding were found to contribute to network structure. eHealth knowledge management strategies should be given attention, for enhanced exchange of knowledge within the public health sector in Kenya.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Tens of thousands of men, women and children are being trafficked around the world and brutally exploited. This research investigated if SA law and policy is equipped to deal with the peculiarities of Human Trafficking. This dissertation's central thesis is that the legal and policy response to human trafficking in South Africa is inadequate to deal with its peculiarities. The anti-trafficking response must extend beyond the application of human rights and criminal law to include a cross-cutting, multi-sectoral, socio-economic and political response that addresses its causes and consequences. The study considers and explores the definition of human trafficking, its causes, consequences and the peculiarities and specificities of human trafficking in SA. The international, regional and domestic legal frameworks and their relevance for human trafficking is outlined with emphasis on the Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 and the National Policy Framework. A feminist lens using Intersectionality and Standpoint Theory, is applied to inform the critical analysis of the research question. This thesis demonstrated that South Africa's law and policy although promising, is insufficient in dealing with the peculiarities of human trafficking. The law needs to better account for the root causes of trafficking. It is essential that this response is informed by intersectionality to enable the implementation of broader solutions especially addressing the violation of social and economic rights and the root causes of trafficking.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>La notion de diversité est aujourd'hui trés en vogue. Nous chercherons à en mesurer les effets dans la litterature contemporaine d' expression française, telle qu' elle se présente dans Ie contexte d'un enseignement universitaire a I'etranger. Si on ne peut que se réjouir des transformations dans la société que reflete Ie mot de &quot; diversite&quot;, on doit pourtant interroger I'aspect plutôt vague de ce terme, qui rencontre ceux de &quot; multiculturel&quot; ou de &quot; pluriculturel&quot; sans apporter rien de précis. Nous essayerons donc de distinguer, au long de notre parcours, trois types de diversités dans I'enseignement de la littérature francophone à I'etranger, en nous basant sur un récit autobiographique de l'écrivain martiniquais, Patrick Chamoiseau : Chemin-d'ecole, tel que I'analysent des chercheurs anglophones. Une première definition de la diversité serait purement linguistique : ce serait celie du &quot; créole&quot;, ou de to ute autre langue &quot; étrangère&quot; qui entre en contact avec Ie français dans un texte, sans considération de I'aspect politique du texte littéraire étudié. La seconde sera it essentiellement politique : ce serait celie de la &quot; créolité&quot;, ou de toute autre langue mineure dans son combat contre la domination du français, qui insisterait sur les aspects politiques du texte étudié. Enfin, la derniére serait avant tout poétique : ce serait celie que pratique Chamoiseau lui-même, en tentant de dépasser les contradictions linguistiques et politiques au moyen de la &quot;creolisation&quot; - par injection de tournures créoles dans Ie parler français. Nous espérons pouvoir en tirer certaines conclusions relatives à I'enseignement de la litterature comme produit multiculturel.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Medical students in South Africa are frequently confronted with mixed messages contributing to uncertainties and dilemmas in their clinical encounters when the gap between theoretical frameworks and the practical realities is illuminated. For instance, learning for and about health and human rights in a spiraling curriculum can be undermined by the recognition that violations can occur in the health system. This website aims to promote a transformative approach to professionalism in which learning can be facilitated by engaging with both the facilitating and hindering influences that characterize clinical practice in South Africa. Digital stories by positive role models offer a collection of reflective insights about Being a Doctor. Resources on probing professionalism can assist students in mediating possible challenging events in their clinical encounters as well as learning from South Africa’s past. The new Six Step Spiral for Critical Reflexivity (SSS4CR) is explained and made available for students and others to use and remix either off or online.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Comprehensive morphometric measurements and counts, external colouration, reproductive behaviour and diet of steentjies (Spondyliosoma emarginatum) in Langebaan Lagoon were recorded between September 2004 and February 2005. Sagittal otoliths were extracted and age estimates recorded from both whole and sectioned otoliths in order to estmate growth and mortality parameters. A total of 302 steentjies (139-312 mm fork length) was sampled of which 243 were females, 55 were males and four were individuals with hermaphroditic gonads. Macroscopic and microscopic examination of gonads and monthly gonadosomtic indices suggest a spring spawning season and that steentjies are protgynous hermaphrodites with males significantly than females (t = 64.75, df = 301, p &lt; 0.001). During the reproductive season, males develop a blue colouration. All males with this colouration had testes classified as either active or ripe and had significantly larger gonad masses than those without mating colours (U = 3.5, Z = 6.48, p $lt; 0.001). The length-at-50%-maturity for females was 171 mm (FL)  and for males was 204 mm (FL). The size at 50% sex change was estimted as 250 mm (FL). Analysis of foregut contents showed steentjies to be opportunitistic ominivores, changing from plant to animal food as they age. The average percent error and coefficient of variation values for whole otoliths were 4.59% and 6.00% respectively, and 10.89% and 14.53% for sectioned otoliths. Although the result of the whole otolith study provided more precise age estimates, there was a strong indication of bias so the sectioned otolith results were used for calculating the growth model. Growth (by sex) was modelled using a model developed for sex changing sparids that allows for accelerated growth after sex change. Steentjies appear to have shorter life spans than most sparids; the oldest individuals sampled attaining less than 7 years of age. Growth rates appear to be relatively high. The smallest, youngest fish were all female, with males only present in the larger size classes. The estimated mortality for steentjies was 0.7y[-1]. Such a high mortality rate implies that further increase in fishing pressure on this species may not be sustainable in Langebaan Lagoon.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study aims to facilitate effective and efficient intersectoral water allocation policy in South Africa, where limited water supplies are increasingly constraining necessary economic development. The study develops an economic model of irrigated agricultural production that recognises the multi-output nature of irrigated agriculture as well as the institutional setting in which commercial irrigation water is allocated in South Africa. The model is then used to econometrically estimate the marginal value of commercial irrigation water in the Berg Water Management Area (WMA), using a Translog functional form, Tobit censored regression model, including controls for heterogeneity, and accounting for heteroscedasticity. The estimates are obtained for 16 irrigated crops in the region and range from an overall mean of 4.84 R/m³ for peaches to 0.14 R/m³ for wheat, but vary significantly between sub-regions and according to soil productivity as well as between crops. Furthermore, the estimates differ substantially from the average value of production per m³ of irrigation water, reflecting a revenue-water elasticity that differs from unity for all crops. The results imply that potential efficiency gains are possible from the intersectoral reallocation of water away from agriculture. A further implication is that reallocation within the agricultural sector would be most efficiently undertaken by farmers themselves, due to the large number factors that affect irrigation water productivity but are unobservable by policymakers or are difficult to account for in the formulation of policy.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer makes up 25% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide. Despite an increasing yearly incidence, there has been a significant decrease in mortality owing to early diagnosis and advances in treatment. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a relatively low cost yet highly effective anti-cancer treatment, increasing survival from 30% to &gt;80%, presently. However, treatment efficacy is marred by the increased risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) - estimated at 10-26%. Internationally, there has been evidence of ACT having a genetic basis. Currently in South Africa, there is little information on ACT in cancer patients and survivors, and no information on the genetic basis of this phenomenon. Our recruitment sites in Cape Town - Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH) and Tygerberg Hospital (TBH), routinely treat hundreds of patients, notably with breast cancer, with anthracycline-based therapy every year, and provided the environment to assess ACT, as well as genetic factors which may influence this adverse drug reaction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) acts as a surrogate measure of cardiac function in the public health-care setting. OBJECTIVES: To provide insight into the clinical management of breast cancer patients on anthracycline-based treatment with a focus on the prevalence of ACT. To provide an index of genetic susceptibility to ACT and potentially contribute to a personalized medicine approach for a genetically diverse population. METHODOLOGY: In the retrospective part of the study, the clinical records of cancer patients treated with anthracyclines from 2011- 2016 at the Oncology Clinic at GSH were analysed. Clinical co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, pre-existing cardiac disease and smoking as well as type and dose of anthracyclines, cardiac function and patient status were assessed. In the prospective study, breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines, with a pre and post-treatment LVEF measure were recruited at GSH and TBH from 2013 to 2016. Patients were consented for access to both clinical information and biological material. Demographics, clinical risk factors and chemotherapeutic regimen data were analysed. LVEF, biomarkers and clinical status were also assessed in terms of reflecting ACT. In some instances certain clinical information was not available (i.e. LVEF) and out of necessity, a statistical correlation model or classifier was created in order to use available clinical data to derive missing clinical measures. Patients' DNA were analysed for seven genetic variants in the following six genes ABCC1 (rs246221); ABCC2 (rs17222723; rs8187710); HNMT (rs17583889); NCF4 (rs1883112): RAC2 (rs13058338) and RARG (rs2229774), and tested for correlation with clinical status and cardiac injury. Finally, a corollary study was conducted on a subset of patients in an attempt to determine whether cardiac biomarkers may be more sensitive measures of cardiotoxicity. RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION: In the retrospective cohort (n=402) 19.7% of patients showed diminished cardiac function. Logistic regression showed that the following predictors: type of first line chemotherapy, and total dose significantly contributed to the ACT phenotype as measured by change in LVEF. In the prospective patients (n=272), 14% were affected with ACT, with an increased likelihood of cardiotoxicity in the Indigenous African population. Logistic regression showed that both total anthracycline dose and change in LVEF were predictive of ACT. In the association study of prospective patients, only the RARG rs2229774 variant was significantly associated with patient ACT status (p=0.049, Chi-Square Test). Forty-two patients were assessed for the β-Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) biomarker and showed limited utility in correlating clinical status and/or LVEF decrease in all patients except Indigenous Africans indicating potential increased susceptibility of population group to ACT. LVEF was found to be unreliable as significant LVEF decreases did not always correlate with cardiac impairment and vice-versa. Changes in routine clinical patient management and overburdening of the nuclear medicine department also translated to only one LVEF measure being obtained in some instances. The statistically derived classifier for missing indicators of heart function was useful, but will require refinement. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Despite the inability of genotype as a predictor of ACT in this study, the increased susceptibility in the Indigenous African population to ACT as well as increased BNP levels after chemotherapy requires a closer look. The interrogation of lndigenous African patient genomes for novel variants of susceptibility to ACT are recommended; this requires building up of a substantial cohort from this population group, which would likely require collaboration with health care institutions in one of the other provinces of South Africa e.g. Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and/or Gauteng. Both this study and literature recommend the need for clinical trials for new and existing drugs on local African populations for both safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the BNP biomarker may be better suited to the prediction of irreversible cardiac damage rather than early cardiotoxicity. Troponin, released in response to cardiomyocyte death, may be a more sensitive biomarker in predicting ACT. Similarly, the inherent variability and lack of sensitivity of LVEF as a measure of cardiac function warrants the consideration of alternatives such as echocardiography or tissue-doppler imaging. Findings derived from this study indicate the need for refined patient management of ACT in a South African population to potentially allow for treatment with minimised risk and event-free breast cancer survival.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The adaptive capability of the operational team to respond to challenges in the Emergency Centre. A SenseMaker® study in Emergency Centres within Cape Town</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background   Emergency centres (ECs) serve as a main entry point for patients into hospitals, and patients that present here are undifferentiated with varying levels of acuity. Uncertainty, interruptions, multiple – often conflicting – priorities, and gaps in information flow are inherent to EC work practices, making it a high-risk environment for operational failure. The EC team, the core of which is formed by doctors and nurses, needs the ability to collaboratively and reliably sense and respond to the constant change and flux of information. This depends on the interactions and sense-making of the EC team.   Objectives   People give meaning to situations through the process of sense-making; they then subjectively construct their reality and share it via plausible stories regarding their situation and environment. The main objective of this study was to explore the collective team-based sense-making of the operational challenges and decisions within the EC. This interprofessionalstudy focused on the dynamics and negotiations within the EC as a complex adaptive system.   Methods   This exploratory study used narrative-based inquiry with abductive reasoning to meet the objectives. It was divided into two sections. The first was a thick description of the EC context, daily operations and processes. Then, using the SenseMaker® tool, we captured stories about a situation that stood out to participants, and thus mattered to them. Using this novel method, once they told their story, the storytellers self-analysed their stories within a specially designed framework. The results were then explored to find patterns based on the perspectives of sense-making.   Results   There is no proof of interprofessional sense-making in the EC, and if it occurs it is due to the informal networks between doctors and nurses, and despite formal structure. There is an operational disconnect between doctors, nurses and management, which is caused by information asymmetry, poor feedback loops and disparate communication channels. Because there is no collective sense-making, the EC team is vulnerable to operational failure and crises. Currently, they respond to operational challenges via quick fixes that result in constant firefighting, the impact of which could be seen by the extensive use of war-related metaphors in their stories.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Socio-historical research and land tenure in South Africa: a case study of land tenure rights on the Northern Cape farm of Melkkraal</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The aim of the research was to clarify and explain the land tenure relations of a farming community called Melkkraal situated in the Northern Cape such that development assistance could be rendered to them by the Department of Land Affairs (DLA).The Melkkraal farm has been owned by various members of the Kotze family since 1834 and through the process of testate and intestate succession has passed from one generation to the next. At present the farm is owned by seven members of the Kotze family in a co-ownership. However, it is also a home to twenty-six households of which three have a legal title to the land as co-owners. The remaining households have occupied the land through a haphazard process of acquiring oral permission from some of the co-owners and non-owning residents, some for as long as sixty five years. This has led to a tenure conundrum because the way in which the Melkkraal farm is registered means that neither the twenty six families who use the land, nor the seven co-owners can access the DLA assistance or effectively assert authority to make development decisions. As a result, the community requested the Surplus Peoples Project and the Environmental Monitoring Group (EMG) to advise them on the steps they would need to gain access to the DLA assistance and to better manage the land. During January 2004, SPP and EMG undertook to investigate and report on the nature and content of the rights of the members of the community in relation to the rights of the co-owners so that the community could be assisted to formulate a strategy for the achievement of their developmental objectives. In February 2004, SPP conducted an extensive research study on how the community members hold, use and transact rights in land. While participatory action research was the overall research paradigm, the particular research technique used for the Melkkraal case study was participatory rural appraisal (PRA). PRA is an action research tool or technique that involves community members defining and working to solve local concerns. As a result of the use of PRA the following research phases were drafted: The first phase of the research entailed the collection and analysis of archival data to develop an understanding of the co-ownership and its co-owners and to develop a genealogy of the co-ownership. The second phase entailed conducting field work at Melkkraal in terms of interviewing the heads of each household as well as an interview with the land management committee. Phase three entailed a follow up visit to Melkkraal, a presentation of a progress report, a participatory mapping session and a focus group workshop on the various land uses at Melkkraal. The final phase of the research included another follow up visit to Melkkraal, the completion of the research analysis and the development of a final report that was presented to the community. The final presentation entailed a workshop explaining the land rights of the various households and a discussion of the way forward. The research findings revealed that very little difference exists between the non-owning residents and the co-owners in terms of how land is used and transacted. This was attributed to the evolution of the social land ethic such that one can speak of the Melkkraal farm as a common property regime. Therefore, in practice there is no difference between a non-owning resident and a co-owner. The findings also revealed that just cause can be shown to apply for a declaratory order to invoke the Interim Protection of Informal Rights Act 31 of 1996. A successful application will mean that the existing informal rights in land of the non-owning residents will be elevated to the status of real rights in property.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Computational analysis of Escherichia coli O25 and O25b carbohydrate antigens using the CHARMM36 and GLYCAM06 force fields</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The emergence of ST131 extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is a growing international health concern. Infections are common, treatment options for antibiotic resistant bacteria are limited and there is no vaccine available. Polysaccharides serve key functions in immune response to bacterial infection. The Opolysaccharides present on the cell surface of gram negative bacteria are antigenic and are associated with specific bacterial serogroups. These are, therefore, a potentially effective target for vaccines. Most ST131 E. coli isolates express the O25b antigen and monoclonal antibodies that are specific to it have been isolated. The chemical structure of O25b has been characterized and differentiated from that of the previously known O25 (or O25a) variety. Relatively little is known about the conformations of O25a and O25b and how they differ, however. As conformation is a factor in antigen-antibody binding, differences between the conformations of these two antigens may be relevant to further research into carbohydrate targeted vaccines and diagnosis techniques for ST131:O25b bacteria. The conformations of polysaccharides are typically dynamic in solution and are difficult to determine empirically. Molecular dynamics simulation provides a means of estimating polysaccharide conformation but the results are critically dependent on the quality of the selected force field. Carbohydrate force fields have matured over the past few decades and CHARMM36 and GLYCAM06 are used extensively for the analysis of bacterial polysaccharides. Studies that compare results from these two widely used force fields are, however, still quite rare. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations of unacetylated, 3 RU oligosaccharide extensions to compare the CHARMM36 and GLYCAM06 force fields and to present an initial analysis of the conformations of the O25a and O25b E. coli antigens. We then apply CHARMM36 molecular dynamics simulation to analogous O- and N- acetylated oligosaccharide extensions to gauge the effect of these groups on the conformations of the two antigens and to compare O25a and O25b. Despite some differences, our CHARMM36 and GLYCAM06 simulations are largely in agreement regarding the conformation of O25a trimers without O- or N-acetylation. Both force fields predict extended, linear antigen conformations. Differences between the two force fields are noted in our analogous study of O25b however: GLYCAM06 favors a collapsed, globular oligosaccharide over a more extended molecule favored by CHARMM36; CHARMM36 and GLYCAM06 predict different preferred dihedral values for a conformationally important, main-chain ɑ-L-Rhap-(1-&gt;3)- β-D-Glcp bond; GLYCAM06 favors an anti-Ψ, anti-ω orientation of a side-chain β-D-Glc-(1-&gt;6)-ɑD-Glc bond over an anti-Ψ, syn-ω orientation favored by CHARMM36. These findings are in agreement with other studies that indicate the collapse of some oligosaccharides into metastable globular conformations during simulations with GLYCAM06. Our CHARMM36 simulations of O- and N-acetylated, 3 RU oligosaccharide extensions of O25a and O25b indicate large differences between the conformations of the two antigens: First, the O25b trimer favors either a compressed or extended helical conformation in solution whereas the O25a trimer favors a single, extended conformation. Second, O25a and O25b exhibit notably different dihedral values for conformationally important glycosidic bonds that correspond with the reported structural differences between the two antigens. Third, O- and N-acetylation is found to facilitate rotation about a key ɑ-D-Glcp-(1-&gt;3)-ɑ-L-Rhap2Ac bond in O25b that, in turn, facilitates the formation of compressed, helical O25b conformations. These compressed conformations are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds that involve O- and N-acetyl groups. Finally, N-acetyl groups appear to be shielded on the inside of the compressed O25b helix whereas O-acetyl groups appear to be exposed on the outside of the molecule. We postulate that these large conformational differences provide a rationale for the clinically noted differences in cross reactivity of monoclonal antibodies for the O25a and O25b antigens.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Three different, but complementary strategies for the enantioselective synthesis of the secoiridoid core of amarogentin were evaluated. The first is based on the enantioselective desymmetrisation of meso-anhydrides using titanium TADDOLates.  1,2,4,6-Tetrahydrophthalic anhydride was  desymmetrised and chemoselectively reduced to give (3aR, 7aS)-3a,4,7,7a-Tetrahydro-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one. Further development of this route was performed on a racemic model.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>An Equity Analysis of the Burden from Alcohol Consumption in South Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: Alcohol consumption remains one of the leading contributors to the risk of mortality worldwide. While literature sources are clear that alcohol consumption has a major negative impact on society and which is felt more severely amongst low-socioeconomic families, the literature on alcoholrelated harm on individuals and households in South Africa, especially from different socio-economic backgrounds, is very limited. This study represents an initial attempt to assess inequalities and inequity in alcohol consumption, at the household and individual levels, in South Africa using national household data. The objectives of this study are (1) to examine the usability of existing survey data in South Africa for assessing alcohol-related expenditure and impacts; (2) to provide a detailed description of alcohol consumption patterns in South Africa at the individual level using various equity stratifiers and (3) to assess the socioeconomic distribution of expenditure on alcoholic beverages at the household level in South Africa. Methods. For objective 1, all publicly available alcohol data sources for South African populations were scanned to examine their usability. A set of qualitative interviews with 10 key researchers in the alcohol policy and economics field in South Africa were undertaken to capture their experience and perceptions of alcohol data in South Africa. The analysis involved identifying databases known to key informants, exploring challenges in using the datasets for research and further analyzing any recommendations for how routine datasets could be better used to inform policy. For Objectives 2 and 3, this study used publicly available secondary data, including the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) and the Income Expenditure Survey (IES). The data have been anonymized and can be accessed from the DataFirst website. Results: There are differences in alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol expenditure among equity stratifiers. The findings show that the burden of alcohol consumption is heavier on the poor. Poorer households spend a significantly larger share of their total household consumption expenditure on alcoholic beverages than richer households—a case of regressivity in spending on alcoholic beverages. Spending on alcohol beverages became less regressive (i.e. a pro-poor ‘shift') between 1995 and 2000; and between 2005/06 and 2010/11. For alcohol consumption patterns, current drinkers are more prevalent among the rich; whereas binge drinkers are more prevalent among the poor. Binge drinking is a problem among the low-income, young individuals, male and African populations. The results also show that there are significant constraints limiting the quality and usefulness of alcohol data in South Africa. These constraints are related to (a) lack of accessibility of survey data, (b) lack of systematic and standardized measurement of alcohol consumption, (c) limited geographic coverage, (d) infrequent survey timing and (e) lack of public availability of industry data on price, production, distribution and consumption of alcohol. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that alcohol consumption in South Africa may be a reflection of genuine differences in consumption patterns among socioeconomic status, and the burden falls most heavily on poorer households and individuals. Based on the results, there is an opportunity to further reduce the regressivity of alcohol expenditure by implementing comprehensive alcohol harm-reduction policies. This study supports recommendations for the South African government to continue to push for evidence-based alcohol policies aiming to decrease alcohol consumption, especially for risky drinkers. However, limited data accessibility in South Africa could potentially impact on the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of relevant policy and interventions to address alcohol-related harms. Thus, for implementing evidence-based alcohol policy in South Africa to be successful, the government must have accessible, reliable and meaningful data for stakeholders and researchers to evaluate interventions and assess whether national alcohol policies aiming to decrease alcohol consumption have achieved their intended objectives.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The dissertation evaluates the impacts of state relocation projects on beneficiaries housing satisfaction. The government embarks on relocation projects as a means to address massive housing backlog. One of the main drawbacks with relocation projects is locational disadvantage. The broad aim of this dissertation is to evaluate the impacts of a state led relocation project on beneficiary housing satisfaction. The research method employed in the study was the case study based on a state project used for the evaluation process. In order to evaluate beneficiary housing satisfaction, I set an impact assessment criteria specifically (1) enabling mobility; (2) enabling choice; (3) meeting economic needs; (4) meeting physical needs (5) meeting social needs and enabling access to public services; (6); enabling security of tenure; and (7) environmental resilience. The study findings revealed that beneficiaries were highly dissatisfied with their housing. The main driving factor to dissatisfaction was unfavourable location of the settlement which resulted in accessibility challenges to Cape Town central business district, socio-economic opportunities and transport. The relocation process impacted greatly on livelihood strategies of beneficiaries. Beneficiary aspirations were not met. The contribution of the study is not only to unveil the mismatch in state housing projects but also to ensure that future state assisted projects are delivered on quality approach as opposed to quantity approach.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Ex Nihilo : emptiness and art</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The purpose of this document is the elaboration of a system of thought that sees art as an empty structure, in a way that is analogous to the conceptual mechanics of Buddhism. What is meant exactly by the term Buddhism will I hope, become clearer as the reader moves through it. Likewise, it is hoped that a perspective on art that sees it as sharing certain conceptual tendencies with Buddhism will emerge. What must be borne in mind for the meantime is the following; firstly, that the concept of emptiness in Buddhism is not nihilism, and this holds true for the system that I describe; it is my position that much art is empty (in a way) and necessarily so. Secondly, that both systems (though not exclusively), are ways of relating, rather than bodies of text or specific images. Wittgenstein's view of philosophy is analogous to this last point in that he insisted on seeing philosophy as a method rather than a science (Perloff 1996: 46). This tendency of mode over product, or way of relating over the thing made, is a critical underlying component of what follows in this document and in my practical production.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: Intrapartum complications contribute to nearly half of all avoidable maternal and perinatal deaths nationally. Inadequate understanding of the labour process by midwives, poor documentation of labour monitoring and inadequate systemlevel support may lead to wrong diagnosis, incorrect management, and the potential for missed opportunities to prevent mortality. Aim: To evaluate the effect of an intervention package of training and clinical facilitation on the quality of clinical management in labour by registered midwives in primary level public sector health facilities in rural South Africa. Methods: Research design : Pragmatic cluster randomised trial with 12 month follow-up. Setting and participants : Seventeen clusters stratified by geo-political region and size of service; 1020 labour records (60 per cluster / site; systematic random sample); and 154 registered midwives employed in the study sites during the study period. Participants were not blinded. Intervention : A package of clinical faclitation training for selected experienced midwife clinicians / managers, and an intrapartum educational update for midwives. Intervention and control sites continued receiving routine communication, all clinical guidelines and scheduled outreach activities. Main outcome measures : Primary outcome - clinical practice measuring partograph utilisation, using a modified partograph checklist, the testing of which is described in this study. Secondary outcome - midwives’ knowledge and skills, measured by written and clinical tests. Outcomes were analysed at the individual level using regression methods that allowed for clustering. The evaluator was blinded to the study allocation. Findings: The mean scores for the total partograph were not statistically significantly different between arms; the mean difference was 1.55 points out of a possible score 47 (95% CI: -1.18 to 4.28) p= 0.27. At a score of 27 the estimated absolute difference was 13.6% (95% CI : 0.16 to 0.25) p = 0.026. The total score for midwives’ knowledge and skills was 7 points (out of a possible 119) higher in the intervention arm (95% CI : 2.1 to 12.3), p=0.006. Conclusions: Although there was no difference in the quality of the overall completion of the partograph, there was a statistically significant difference in those of better quality completions in the intervention arm. Midwives’ knowledge and skills were higher in the intervention arm and those in the control arm deteriorated over time. This difference was statistically significant. Recommendations and implications for practice: This indicates a critical need to provide continuing professional education to midwives and to arrange midwifery staffing that optimises clinical practice in settings where intrapartum care is offered. In addition to regular, sustainable programmes to enhance partograph utilisation and midwife knowledge and skills, barriers to the utilisation of the partograph need to be investigated and addressed.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Metallacycloalkanes are important intermediates in organic transformations involving transition metals. These transformations include olefin metathesis, ethylene oligomerization etc. The studying of thermal decomposition behavior of these compounds can help us to understand the termination step in the mechanism of these transformations. This thesis describes the thermal decomposition studies on some new metallacycloalkanes with medium to large ring size and their precursor compounds.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gamma-herpesvirus with a particularly high seroprevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), is the etiological agent of the endothelial tumour Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related malignancy worldwide and particularly in SSA. It also causes primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). AIDS-related deaths have declined, due to global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the vast majority of these occurred in SSA, where tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, accounting for a third of all AIDS-related deaths. The exceptionally high burden of suspected TB in SSA causes misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of diseases mimicking TB, such as several pathologies associated with KSHV. KSHV infection is essential but insufficient for the development of KS and other KSHV-associated pathologies; precipitating factors, such as HIV-related immune suppression and potentially genetic predisposition, are required. The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) receptor A2 protein (EPHA2) tyrosine kinase receptor is a promising candidate for studies on genetic variants as it potentially acts on two levels: susceptibility to KSHV infection (being one of the key receptors utilised by KSHV for cell entry and intracellular trafficking) and susceptibility to KS development (being implicated in oncogenesis). Despite the high seroprevalence in SSA, the contribution of dysregulated KSHV lytic replication or host KSHV receptor variations to disease outcome in HIV-infected patients is unknown. We hypothesised that KSHV lytic reactivation plays yet unrecognised roles for morbidity and mortality in high HIV settings and to this end, we conducted a cohort study of 682 HIV-positive critically ill patients admitted to Khayelitsha Day Hospital, South Africa, investigated for TB, and followed for 12-weeks to ascertain vital status. We demonstrated that elevated blood KSHV viral load (VL) was a strong predictor of death in hospitalised HIV-infected patients without microbiologically proven TB. Further, we identified and validated variants in the EPHA2 protein tyrosine kinase and sterile alpha motif domains that were significantly associated with susceptibility to infection, KS development and/or KSHV VL in 300 South African HIV-infected patients, by aggregate by-gene analysis. In order to elucidate the functional significance of the identified EPHA2 missense mutations, we knocked out endogenous EPHA2 by CRISPR/Cas9 in the human endothelial cell line, HuARLT2, and reintroduced the wild type and mutant EPHA2 open reading frames by lentiviral transduction. These engineered cells were assessed for baseline EPHA2 phosphorylation levels and susceptibility to KSHV infection utilising recombinant KSHV in binding, internalisation and infection assays. We found that the EPHA2 mutant c.2254T&gt;C (p.Leu700Pro) in the tyrosine kinase domain, associated with KS in our patient cohort, was deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation and less permissive to rKSHV infection when introduced as a single mutation or as a double mutant together with c.2257A&gt;C (p.Asp701Ala) which was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with it. Another tyrosine kinase domain variant, c.2688G&gt;S (p.Ala845Pro), found to be overrepresented among KS patients, had enhanced baseline tyrosine phosphorylation levels. These findings validated the patient-derived data on the molecular level by assigning functional consequences to some mutants which might have implications for the development of future biomarkers predicting KS susceptibility in high-risk populations. In summary, this novel research contributes to the understanding of KSHV-associated pathology and disease outcome. It identified KSHV VL as a potential biomarker to predict KSHV-associated diseases and mortality and assessed the contribution of KSHV entry receptor EPHA2 variations to KSHV-associated pathologies, with potential clinical implications, by facilitating the development of novel diagnostic and surveillance tools.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Leveraging genotypes imputation and polygenic risk scores in malaria susceptibility</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Kimathi, Peter Opiyo</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Chimusa, Emile R</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>Pathology</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Background Over the past few years, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants that are associated with a wide range of complex traits, and have provided valuable insights as far as their genetic architectures are concerned. In malaria studies too, GWAS has been successful and a number of genetic variants have been identified. Despite the success, the complete aetiology of malaria, and many complex traits in general, remains poorly understood. A key concern is that the missing heritability remains too large, with some of the variants identified in some populations failing to replicate using independent study populations. Indeed comparable sources have revealed that the statistical power of association studies can be improved either via genotypes imputation approaches or by treating the whole genome of an individual as a risk predictor using Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS). However, imputation remains at modest in Africa populations with few (or no) studies (study) have evaluated the potential of imputation tools in African populations. On the other hand, although the utility of PRS has been shown in other studies, it has neither been assessed in African population nor applied in an infectious disease, like malaria. Methodology We evaluated the performance of five popular genotypes imputation methods (IMPUTE4, minimac 4, IMPUTE2, minimac3 and BEAGLE4) using case control datasets that mimics African populations, European populations and the admixed populations simulated with FractalSIM. We assessed imputation performance based on internal imputation quality metrics and the genotypes concordance. We applied the best imputation tool based on the assessment results to impute raw genotypes data of severe malaria case control studies from MalariaGEN of three African populations: Kenya, The Gambia and Malawi. Similarly, we obtained summary statistics of the same datasets, and imputed the summary statistics with ImpG. We performed an association on the imputed raw genotypes, and compared the association results with that of ImpG based imputation. Additionally, we performed meta-analysis with METASOFT, and compared the meta-analysis result of ImpG based imputation and that from imputed raw genotypes associations. Finally, we assessed five PRS methods (PRSice, LDpred(p+t), PRSoS, PLINK and PRScS) in predicting genetic risk in African population, and applied the best PRS method to predict the genetic risk of severe malaria. Results IMPUTE2 recorded the best performance based on imputation accuracy and concordance for the African (accuracy=80.21% and concordance=99.2%) and the admixed samples (accuracy=69.46% and concordance=90.92%) for variants with MAF&gt;0.05. Other tools recorded similar accuracy and concordance although BEAGLE 4 recorded the lowest concordance and accuracy across all the African and admixed datasets. For the real genotypes data, no SNP attained the genome wide significant threshold of 5.0 × 10−8 for Malawi and the Gambia datasets. However, for the Kenyan dataset, 9 SNPs on chromosome 11 were significantly associated with severe malaria. 3 of these SNPS were located on the HBG2 genes and the remaining 6 had not been reviewed. No SNP attained the genome wide threshold for the ImpG imputed summary statistics for all the populations. For IMPUTE2 based meta-analysis, only one SNP rs12295158 located on the HBB region was significant across all the meta-analysis model (with P-value of 2.88 × 10−12 for fixed (FE), 2.88 × 10−12 random (RE) and 9.64 × 10−12 binary effect (BE) respectively). On the other hand ImpG based meta-analysis, two SNPs were signicant across all the meta-analysis model (rs183731078 located on RFX3 with P-values of 8.40 × 10−9 , 8.40 × 10−9 , 4.47 × 10−8 for FE, RE and BE respectively, and rs8096513 located on DLGAP1 1.43 × 10−9 , 1.43 × 10−9 , 1.01 × 10−8 with P-value for FE, RE and BE respectively). Pathway enrichment and analysis of these genes revealed that both of these genes are associated with malaria. Finally, for the PRS, PRSoS recorded the best performance based on Nargalkerke's R 2 (0.01736) and area under curve (AUC) (0.511). Other PRS methods recorded slightly similar results with PLINK recording the least. The odds of having severe malaria was estimated as 2.869, and a unit change of PRS scores was associated with -5.143 change in odds of having severe malaria with P-value of 0.0193 at α = 0.05. However, the scores could only explain 1.28% of the phenotypic variance. Conclusion Our results provide foundation for future studies in genetics, especially in African population, where the best performing imputation tool remains a mystery. Moreover, our results have demonstrated the potential of application of PRS in infectious diseases.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Patterns among micronekton communities in relation to environmental conditions at two shallow seamounts in the south-western Indian Ocean</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Seamounts are ubiquitous topographic features across all ocean basins. They rise steeply through the water column from abyssal depths. Depending on their size, shape and summit depths, seamounts reportedly have an influence on the physical flow regimes which may promote the aggregation of zooplankton, micronekton, and top predators above or in the immediate vicinity of their summits. Micronekton form a key trophic link between zooplankton and top marine predators, and are divided into the broad categories: crustaceans, cephalopods and mesopelagic fishes. The vertical and horizontal distributions, assemblages and trophic relationships of micronekton were investigated at two shallow seamounts of the south-western Indian Ocean. La Pérouse is a steep bathymetric feature rising from a deep seabed located at 5000 m and with a summit depth at ~60 m below the sea level. This seamount is located at the north-western periphery of the oligotrophic Indian South Subtropical Gyre province. A seamount to the south of Madagascar, named “MAD-Ridge” in this study, has a summit depth at ~240 m below the sea level and rises from a base at ~1600 m. MAD-Ridge is located within an “eddy corridor” within the productive East African Coastal Province. The micronekton acoustic densities were greater at MAD-Ridge relative to La Pérouse, in accordance with the difference in productivity between the two sites. Physical processes within the cyclonic mesoscale eddy sampled during the MAD-Ridge cruise led to enhanced micronekton acoustic densities in the eddy relative to the MAD-Ridge seamount. While the shallow scattering layer (0-200 m) consisted of common oceanic micronekton species, the summits and flanks of La Pérouse and MAD-Ridge both showed presence of resident or seamount-associated fish species during day and night. Micronekton were also shown to exhibit a range of migration strategies such as diel vertical migration, mid-water migration and no diel migration. However, despite the differing productivity between both pinnacles, crustaceans, smaller-sized squids and mesopelagic fishes exhibited trophic levels ranging from 3 to 4 at both seamounts. This thesis highlights important knowledge gaps on seamount ecosystems and ecological patterns associated to shallow pinnacles. It also underlines the importance of studying seamount ecosystems of the south-western Indian Ocean in order to promote management and conservation measures for a sustainable use of such specific environments.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The objective of this study was to evaluate water conservation and water demand management in an industrialised City of uMhlathuze in Richards Bay. The City of uMhlathuze Local Municipality is the third-largest municipality in KwaZulu Natal (KZN) and is strategically placed to continue attracting investment as an aspirant metropolis due to the newly established Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) and the country's largest deep-water port. As an industrialised city, uMhlathuze's demand for water is already increasing and with the establishment of the IDZ, it is expected that water demand will escalate even further once the IDZ is fully operational. In line with the research question, this study has, therefore, sought to understand whether the industrialised City of uMhlathuze has developed and effectively implemented a water conservation and water demand management strategy and interventions in order to sustain water supply in anticipation of growing demand due to industrialisation and population growth. This objective was achieved by evaluating the city's current interventions and measures using a range of water conservation and water demand management solutions and guidelines. During this study, it was evident that the greatest threat facing South Africa's ambitious future economic growth, poverty alleviation and government's transformation agenda was the inefficient and unbalanced use of available and limited water resources. Thus, in order to avoid this imminent threat, the country as a whole must continuously reduce water consumption and demand from various sectors. This goal can be achieved through sustainable and improved water conservation and water demand management interventions. The study found that, in recent years, the issue of water scarcity had escalated in KZN. The province was in the grip of a drought, which was taking its toll on water supply in various municipalities around the province. The sparse rainfall in most parts of the province had caused the levels of rivers and dams to decrease to a point of crisis. Consequently, the KZN Provincial Government declared the province a disaster area in 2015. During the study, there was very little improvement as the City of uMhlathuze was still subjected to level 4 water restrictions. Evidently, the drought was intensifying the water problem in a municipality already grappling with poor and inadequate water infrastructure. A review of international and local literature was undertaken to theoretically position the objective of the research. An evaluation of the City of uMhlathuze water conservation and water demand management strategy and interventions was conducted using a questionnaire completed by city officials and part of the study included documentation review. This study investigated key elements of water conservation and demand management as well as interventions that were pertinent to achieving the desired outcome of efficient use of water. Respondents were required to answer questions focusing on several water conservation and water demand management related approaches and solutions. During the study, it was identified that there were inconsistencies in the implementation of water conservation and water demand management interventions even though the City of uMhlathuze had already taken the important step of developing a water conservation and water demand management strategy. It was recognised, however, that water conservation and water demand management remained relatively new for most municipalities. Consequently, it would take time for municipalities, together with communities, to implement effective interventions. The focus needs to be on the establishment of a combined team of staff and stakeholders, set up to finding solutions and interventions designed to maximise the most sustainable and efficient use of water. The conclusions drawn from this study and proposed recommendations indicated that wastewater reuse; pipe replacement; water pressure management; rainwater and stormwater harvesting; water sensitive urban design; leak detection and repair; joint planning and research team with the Industrial Development Zone; groundwater and aquifer recharge; stakeholder engagement, education and citizen awareness are feasible options for the City of uMhlathuze to consider in relation to water conservation and water demand management. These solutions should constitute the foundation of a revised and updated water conservation and water demand management strategy to be implemented incrementally with broad-based participation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This report presents the findings of the outcome-based evaluation of the Beautiful Gate programme for vulnerable children. The evaluation seeks to ascertain the extent to which the programme is producing the intended results and whether those results include unintended side effects. The Beautiful Gate programme is a social programme aimed at providing care to vulnerable children, their families and the community. The objectives of the programme are to meet the medical, physical, emotional and social needs of vulnerable children, particularly those that are affected by HIV/AIDS in the communities of the Nyanga Health District in Cape Town, South Africa. The programme provides an interim safe environment for children, whilst actively working towards their reintegration into society. The evaluation utilised a descriptive design. Multiple data collection methods were used, which included a questionnaire-based survey and review of programme records. A paper based questionnaire was administered to the programme staff, which consisted of caregivers, administration staff and pre-school teachers. Results from this evaluation study revealed that children who participate III this programme exhibit improved quality of life. Research findings have shown that the children's welfare, personal development and social conditions significantly improved through access to a safe environment, proper nutrition, medical services, education, as well as psychosocial support.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Insects, including wild bees (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) are exceptional model organisms to assess the effect of climate variation on species richness along altitudinal gradients. Climate variables and weather conditions are of extreme importance for insects particularly since their capacity of body temperature regulation is determined by the ambient temperature. Additionally, bee diversity has proven to be strongly related to the availability of host plants, determinant factors for their presence or absence and both of which are limited at higher altitudes. Therefore, the study of wild bee diversity at various altitudes in the tropics could provide information on possible responses of bee species and communities to climate variations, important to estimate effects of climate change on an important ecosystem service such as pollination. Bees being ecologically important insects with close links to plants, high richness and abundance are well-suited as terrestrial habitat bioindicators. The group is sensitive to environmental disturbances relies upon local plant communities and comprises an assemblage of species with varying social structure, nesting guilds and other life history traits. Additionally, bees are likely more susceptible to negative effects of small effective population size. The life history traits determine the individual and community response to environmental changes. Records from the literature revealed a collector and seasonal bias, with greater effort applied around big cities or specific collecting locations and mainly in the wet season. A preliminary checklist of bees of Angola was created and comprises 209 bee species from 47 genera and five families, but a major proportion of the country's area remains to be surveyed. A national inventory of Angolan bees is proposed, making use of standardized methods and sampling either one quarter degree cell or half degree cells, ideally in both dry and rainy seasons. Wild bee communities were sampled along an altitudinal gradient (760-1651 m.a.s.l) in the biodiversity rich and critically endangered Angolan escarpment. Pan traps, malaise traps and sweep netting were used at twelve sampling points, with an average of 70 m difference in altitude between points. Sweep netting proved to be the most efficient technique. Overall, 845 individuals were collected, representing 51 identified species, 34 genera and five bee families. Contrary to the trends observed in other studies in the tropics, a consistent increase in bee diversity (carried out at genera level) with increasing altitude, from the lower altitude (H'=2,14) to the higher altitude of the gradient (H'=2,26) was found. In addition, community structure differed along the gradient, with distinctive communities in low elevation sites being dominated by Braunsapis, Ceratina, Hypotrigona and Anthidiellum, and high elevation sites the distinctive communities were dominated by Amegilla, Macrogalea, Patellapis and Xylocopa. This result might be consistent with findings from studies of other taxa that attribute to the Angolan escarpment an importance as a centre of endemism and speciation. The results from this study are possibly explained by a combination of factors where the exceptional geomorphology and landscape shape the (direct) influence of environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation on the vegetation communities along the gradient therefore (indirectly) affecting bee community assemblages, particularly for the more specialized bee genera and species. Limited research has been done on the variation of bee body size along altitudinal gradients, but the few studies that have been carried out indicate that future changes (warming) in climatic conditions will most probably alter bees body size (by reduction), consequently affecting their thermoregulatory capacity and, at a larger scale, the overall patterns of community assembly. Along the tropical altitudinal gradient of this study, bee body size was found to increase with altitude by 58% (mean length at lower altitude = 5.06mm against mean = 7.99mm at higher altitude elevation sites) at the community level but also at the intra-specific level, with Macrogalea candida increasing 4% in size between the lower altitude and summit of the transect (mean length at lower altitude = 8.76mm against mean = 9.12mm at higher altitude elevation sites), suggesting that the fairly small temperature gradient along the transect was sufficient to select for body size – either directly, but more likely through multiple avenues, including indirect effects such as changes in rainfall, plant community composition and plant phenology. This result constitutes, to my best knowledge, the first demonstration of Bergmann's rule applicability at different levels of biotic organization of bee communities in the tropical region. Effective conservation planning is highly dependent on robust, spatially explicit biodiversity data. The generation of comprehensive insect profiles through long term monitoring studies at the national level can identify areas with high species turnover and endemism – patterns that could be missed if only vertebrate data were considered. In under-developed countries like Angola, where a poorly documented but highly rich biodiversity is severely threatened by unregulated land use, and research is hampered by financial constraints and lack of human resources, the combined use of indicator taxa for both terrestrial (bees) and freshwater (Odonata) environments might be a reasonable surrogate for total biodiversity status assessments. The results from this study highlight the need for long term monitoring to efficiently assess bee diversity, especially in critically endangered landscapes where anthropogenic pressures are high.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Human security is an essential aspect of human rights, as it is necessary for every human to feel secured in their community, and country at large. However, human security is frequently threatened by conflict, especially in Africa. Adding to the different challenges that most African states face, conflict contributes immensely towards destabilizing human security. As such, this thesis addresses the destabilized human security situation in Nigeria, by examining the implication of the Boko Haram insurgency. The effects of the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria, ranges from political, economic, social, cultural, to environmental. These insecurities have led to the destabilisation of the country and its economy. Although human security is broad, this thesis focuses on the political and socio-economic implications of the Boko Haram insurgency. This includes, but not limited to, poverty and illiteracy, unemployment, poor healthcare service, displacement, national insecurity, and political instability. The thesis argues that the Nigerian government has been unable to defeat the insurgent group due to the increasing rate of corruption in the country, which in turn leads to lack of adequate human and material resources need to win the group. In conducting this research, a literature-based methodology was employed, where secondary data, in the form of books, newspapers, online articles/journals, and reports, that have been written on the topic, were critically analysed to draw up adequate information on the activities of Boko Haram and it implications on the human security of the country.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The shoulder joint is the most mobile and unstable joint in the human body. This makes it vulnerable to soft tissue pathologies and dislocation. Insight into the kinematics of the joint may enable improved diagnosis and treatment of different shoulder pathologies. Shoulder joint kinematics can be influenced by the articular geometry of the joint. The aim of this project was to develop an analysis framework for shoulder joint kinematics via the use of articulated statistical shape models (ASSMs). Articulated statistical shape models extend conventional statistical shape models by combining the shape variability of anatomical objects collected from different subjects (statistical shape models), with the physical variation of pose between the same objects (articulation). The developed pipeline involved manual annotation of anatomical landmarks selected on 3D surface meshes of scapulae and humeri and establishing dense surface correspondence across these data through a registration process. The registration was performed using a Gaussian process morphable model fitting approach. In order to register two objects separately, while keeping their shape and kinematics relationship intact, one of the objects (scapula) was fixed leaving the other (humerus) to be mobile. All the pairs of registered humeri and scapulae were brought back to their native imaged position using the inverse of the associated registration transformation. The glenohumeral rotational center and local anatomic coordinate system of the humeri and scapulae were determined using the definitions suggested by the International Society of Biomechanics. Three motions (flexion, abduction, and internal rotation) were generated using Euler angle sequences. The ASSM of the model was built using principal component analysis and validated. The validation results show that the model adequately estimated the shape and pose encoded in the training data. Developing ASSM of the shoulder joint helps to define the statistical shape and pose parameters of the gleno humeral articulating surfaces. An ASSM of the shoulder joint has potential applications in the analysis and investigation of population-wide joint posture variation and kinematics. Such analyses may include determining and quantifying abnormal articulation of the joint based on the range of motion; understanding of detailed glenohumeral joint function and internal joint measurement; and diagnosis of shoulder pathologies. Future work will involve developing a protocol for encoding the shoulder ASSM with real, rather than handcrafted, pose variation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The study determined the influence of social patterns on the adoption of mobile phones in agricultural society. It targeted small farmers in the African society, and its population was drawn from Tanzania. The study was conducted with the knowledge that small (peasant) farmers make up a large component of the African population. Enhancing the economic performance of farmers would improve the general economy of the addressed society, and eventually be translated to the Gross Domestic Product. On this basis, the adoption of ICTs (mobile phones in particular) would enhance the farmers' ability to access the right information for their day-to- day activities. Therefore, this was the reason why this study decided to find out whether social factors contribute to the adoption of mobile phones in the farming society. There are numerous models regarding the adoption of a new innovation by users. Nevertheless, models discussed in this study had social factors as a common aspect. Conceptually the study considered farmers' spending ability, the influence of the success of others, and the adoption on demand, as the factors within social variables. Other variables included the perceived economic benefits, the perceived intention to use, and the rate of use (use behaviour). Moreover, it is necessary to acknowledge that the study was conducted objectively, and embraced hypothesis testing as the basis for decision making. Data were obtained through a survey questionnaire. Generally, the findings of the study suggested the followings: Farmers' spending ability relates to their willingness to learn new mobile tools, peer influence relates to the intention to learn, adoption on demand influences the perceived usefulness of mobile tools, and the perceived usefulness relates with the rate of mobile use. The general view of this study is that social factors influence the adoption of mobile phones in the farming community, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, these factors may be applied to enhance the adoption of mobile phones in the farming community for improved production.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: Drug use by young people is on the increase globally, regionally and locally, in Zimbabwe. Most of what is known about the risk and protective factors for drug use has been written from studies done in high income countries. Limited studies focused on the low to medium income countries. The available literature for Zimbabwe is a few quantitative studies, done nearly two decades ago. These might not still be relevant today because of the generational changes that have taken place in the society over time. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in Mufakose, one of the low income high density suburbs of Harare, Zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to find out the reasons why young people in the community were using drugs while others within the same geographical area were not using. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit 40 young people aged between 18 and 24 years who were current drug users, past users and those who had never used drugs at all in their entire lifetime. Individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted at two community centres in the community to elicit data from the participants. Data collected from the in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were analysed using NVivo using themes that were derived from literature. Results: Results showed that both risk and protective factors for drug use exist at three levels of human interaction: the micro, meso and macro levels. Micro level risk factors included stressors from the home or living arrangements or workplace, stress due to loss of a loved one, boredom due to unemployment and lack of activities, a lack of commitment to work, sport or school and one's beliefs. Meso level risk factors were exposure to the drug using behaviour by peers and bullying. At family level, exposure to drug use, family conflicts were reported as risk factors. At macro level, drug availability and cost and media influence were cited as risk factors for drug use among the group. For the protective factors leading to non-use, religion was the strongest protective factor at all the three levels. A commitment to work, sport or school was also protective at micro level. Non-exposure to drug using behaviour were protective at the meso level. Conclusion: The current social environment in Zimbabwe together with a breakdown of the country's institutions such as marriage due to death, divorce or migration to other countries. The breakdown has left some children in single parent families vulnerable to a life of drug use. Early initiation into drug use was reported to be through exposure from peers, families and other members of the community as young people in Mufakose are using drugs in-order to escape from the reality of life. Evidence based psychosocial interventions could be used to reduce the impact of drug use among this population.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Mining a large shopping database to predict where, when, and what consumers will buy next</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Retailers with electronic point-of-sale systems continuously amass detailed data about the items each consumer buys (i.e. what item, how often, its package size, how many were bought, whether the item was on special, etc.). Where the retailer can also associate purchases with a particular individual for example, when an account or loyalty card is issued, the buying behaviour of the consumer can be tracked over time, providing the retailer with valuable information about a customer's changing preferences. This project is based on mining a large database, containing the purchase histories of some 300 000 customers of a retailer, for insights into the behaviour of those customers. Specifically, the aim is to build three predictive models, each forming a chapter of the dissertation; forecasting the number of daily customers to visit a store, detecting changes in consumers' inter-purchase times, and predicting repeat customers after being given a special offer. Having too many goods and not enough customers implies loss for a business; having too few goods implies a lost opportunity to turn a profit. The ideal situation is to stock the appropriate number of goods for the number of customers arriving, so you can minimize loss, and maximize profit. To attend to this problem, in the first chapter we forecast the number of customers that will visit a store each day to buy any product (i.e. store daily visits). In the process we also carry out a time-series forecasting methods comparison, with the main aim of comparing machine learning methods to classical statistical methods. The models are fitted into a univariate time-series data and the best model for this particular dataset is selected using three accuracy measures. The results showed that there was not much difference between the methods, but some classical methods slightly performed better than the machine learning algorithms, and this was consistent with outcomes obtained by Makridakis et al. (2018) on similar comparisons. It is also vital for retailers to know when there has been a change in their consumers purchase behaviour. This change can either be the time between purchases, change in brand selection or change in market share. It is critical for such changes to be detected as early as possible, as speedy detection can help managers act before incurring loses. In the second chapter, we use change-point models to detect changes in consumers' inter-purchase times. Change-point models are approaches that offer a flexible, general-purpose solution to the problem of detecting changes in customer historic behaviour. This multiple change-point model assumes that there is a sequence of underlying parameters, and that this sequence is partitioned into contiguous blocks. These partitions are such that the parameter values are equal within, and different between blocks, whereby a beginning of a block is considered to be a change point. This changepoint model is fitted to consumers inter-purchase times (i.e. we model time between purchases) to see whether there were any significant changes on the consumers buying behaviour over a one year purchase period. The results showed that, depending on the length of the sequences, minority to a handful of customers do experience changes in their purchasing behaviours, with the longer sequences having more changes than the shorter ones. The results seemed to be different to those obtained by Clark and Durbach (2014), but analysing a portion of sequences of same lengths as those analysed in Clark and Durbach (2014), lead to similar results. Increasing sales growth is also vital for retailers, and there are various possible ways in which this can be achieved. One of the strategies is what is referred to as up-selling (whereby a customer is persuaded to make an additional purchase of the same product or purchase a more expensive version of the product.) and cross-selling (whereby a retailer sells a different product or service to an existing customer). These involve campaigning to customers and sell certain products, and sometimes include incentives in the campaign with the aim of exposing customers to these products hoping they will become repeat customers afterwards. In Chapter 3 we build a model to predict which customers are likely to become repeat customers after being given a special offer. This model is fitted to customers' time between two purchases, which makes the input time-series data, and is sequential in nature. Therefore, we build models that provide a good way for dealing with sequential inputs (i.e. convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks), and compare them to models that do not take into account the sequence of the data (i.e. feedforward neural networks and decision trees). The results showed that, inter-purchase times are only useful when they are about the same product, as models did no better than random if inter-purchase times were from a different product in the same department. Secondly, it is useful to take the order of the sequence into account, as models that do this do better than those who do not, with the latter not doing any better than a null model. Lastly, while none of the models performed well, deep learning models perform better than standard classification models and produce some substantial lift.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>IT investments constitute a major portion of the capital budgets of many organizations. It can be challenging to select the right projects that fit the corporate strategy to maximize value for the organization. In the past, senior executives focused on projects that met three criteria, namely being on-time, on budget and in scope. However, a shift has occurred as a result of the fact that senior executives are more concerned about the right mix of projects that will best utilise the organization's resources and deliver long-range growth. Some of the benefits of IT Project Portfolio Management (IT PPM) are to provide executives with the ability to monitor projects ensure business alignment and identify risks quickly. It is argued that maintaining a balanced portfolio of diverse projects can reduce the risk of an individual project and can produce a higher rate of return.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In 2014, the One Environmental System for mining came into effect. This legislative framework was introduced to streamline the environmental regulation of mining activities by consolidating such regulation in the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA). The most significant aspect of the regulatory framework, for purposes of this research, is the allocation of powers to the authorities responsible for implementing the One Environmental System. The authorities tasked with implementing the One Environmental System are the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF) and the Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation (DHWS). In the distribution of power, the DMRE is tasked with enforcing the regulatory framework in the minerals extraction industry. The DEFF sets the regulatory framework and is the appeal authority for decisions taken by the DMRE. Finally, the DHWS is responsible for regulating and enforcing the National Water Act. Although introducing the One Environmental System has improved the regulation of the environment in relation to mining, its regulation - and, more so, enforcement - has received more criticism than praise. Intragovernmental fragmentation has been cited as a cause of ineffective implementation of the regulatory framework. A lack of cooperation between the departments hampers the objective of streamlining the environmental regulation of mining. Therefore, it is imperative that the authorised departments cooperate with each other to achieve the effective implementation of the One Environmental System for mining. The aim of this dissertation is to suggest ways to foster cooperation between the DMRE, DEFF and DHWS to achieve the effective implementation of the One Environmental System. This goal is achieved by providing an analysis of the implementation efforts of the three departments. Since the analysis shows that intragovernmental fragmentation has hampered the effective implementation of the regulatory framework, this research provides recommendations to improve the implementation of the One Environmental System.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Plasmodium falciparum is becoming increasingly more resistant to regular antimalarial drugs, making it necessary to identify novel drug candidates and drug targets. Components of the endocytic and secretory pathway in asexual stage parasites are attractive targets because they play a fundamental role in the normal processes of parasite metabolism. Adaptor protein complexes are components of protein coats that associate with transport vesicles of the endocytic and secretory pathways in mammalian cells. Homologues of several adaptor protein subunits are encoded by the parasite genome. The presence of these genes suggests that the parasite experiences clathrin-mediated transport processes. This study reports the cloning and characterization of selected malarial homologues of these adaptor proteins, namely three medium (μ) chain adaptin homologues and two sigma (σ) chains.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Strengthening the enforcement of policy to combat human trafficking: a network approach for improving collaboration</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Modern-day slavery, now termed human trafficking, is a crime that has remerged in the modern day. It is a transnational crime through which a humans vulnerability is exploited through coercive means. In recent decades the issue has attracted policy and legislative attention from governments, however these responses have failed to effectively respond to the complex dimensions of the phenomena. Alongside state measures to reduce the crime have been networks of understudied non-governmental organisations dedicated to combatting human trafficking. As non-governmental organisations develop capacity and knowledge to combat human trafficking they have often become key stakeholders in the field. In this dissertation, I examine to what extent the efforts of NGOs are aligned with the South African Government policy and legislative agenda in dealing with human trafficking. My aim is to determine the extent of alignment and, through applying a policy network framework, what the prospects are for improved collaboration between NGOs and the state. To determine how a collaborative network response can strengthen South Africa's enforcement of anti-trafficking policy, I have used secondary and collected new primary data. Primary data consists of data gathered through a survey of NGOs working on human trafficking in South Africa from which the scope of the reach, activities, and experiences of these stakeholders can inform prospects for collaboration – to improve enforcement of anti-trafficking measures. Findings suggest that a network approach to improve collaboration between the state and non-state stakeholders will be most effective across activities where the state has performed poorly, and where NGOs have displayed a comparative advantage. These activities include prevention-related work such as public awareness, equipping first responders with knowledge through training on human trafficking and legislation, and victim assistance together with aftercare.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The timing of post-conflict elections is a critical element that requires careful consideration to minimize the risk of producing adverse results. Through examining the literature and studying Liberia's 1997 and 2005 elections, this work seeks to identify the best timing practices for post-contlict elections. The theoretical basis, which is inspired by the works of Roland Paris and Terrence Lyons, is that if the circumstances are to permit the long-term goal of democratization, then post-conflict elections should follow a protracted transition period prior to holding the election.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The small-scale mining (SSM) sector in South Africa has been overshadowed by the wealth generating capacity of the formal mining industry. To address the disparity between the SSM sector and the large formal mining industry, a number of government initiatives have been introduced, the latest being the preparation of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28, which was finalized in October 2002. The Act, which has not yet been implemented, is expected to redress some of the sector's current obstacles. Two case studies conducted in the Northern Cape and North West Provinces, provided the basis for this social impact assessment (SIA). The aim of these studies was to identfy the most serious issues faced by the SSM sector and to assess the likely socio-econiomic impacts of the Act.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: The homeless individuals/groups are the most vulnerable and less dignified member of the society. The evidences lie in the nature of their sleeping locations in the urban spaces, amongst other aspects. An internationally unique and integrated approach (GIS/socio-spatial) is utilized to enhance the knowledge and understanding of homelessness through analyzing the spatial characteristics of and around the sleeping locations of the homeless community in the urban public spaces, Cape Town City Bowl (South Africa) case study. Data Source and Method: Through the quantitative approach, the individual sleeping locations of The Homeless, including their surrounding characteristics, are observed daily for two weeks, 13-26 Oct. 2018 (total of all locations: n = 9515, daily average, n = 680) between 06:00 am and 08:30am. The analyses entail sequential application of eight analytical methods; spatial distribution, attribute analysis, proximity analysis, weather analysis, and obfuscation/geographic masking Results: (a) The daily individual sleeping locations of the homeless individuals and groups increase over time but their geographic distributions are similar or display insignificant/little variations. (b) Majority of these locations are situated in marginalized urban spaces that deny The Homeless personal privacy/security, human dignity and perpetuate stigmatization and social isolation. (c) The sleeping locations of The Homeless are far from the sources of basic needs to enhance their livelihoods (e.g., water resources). (d) Although more data is needed, however, the limited data in this research show that weather conditions are (in)directly related to the changes in the numbers of sleeping locations. (d) The voronoi masking and weight rand perturbation are best presenting the sleeping location of The Homeless without compromising the spatial confidence of The Homeless, and the spatial distributions/patterns of these locations. Conclusion: GIS (geographic information system) is capable of enhancing the knowledge and understanding of homelessness, and therefore, it can inform establishments and improvements of initiatives/measures that seek to reduce the vulnerability of the homeless community and/or integrate them with the public community, especial in the urban spaces.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation has attempted to shed light on the character of anti-colonial nationalism. It particularly sought to elucidate why anti-colonial nationalisms, once the enemy is defeated, often fail to provide a sufficient basis for national identification. Why, the initial question posed, are nation-building projects necessary in states whose people have fought nationalist struggles for decades and should therefore be characterised by a high degree of social cohesion on a national level?</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Two separate bioanalytical methods were developed, validated and applied to determine agricultural exposure to organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides using different biological matrices as reference sources. The method that was validated for the quantification of the organochlorine compounds was used to simultaneously determine β-endosulfan [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10- hexacloro-1, 5, 5a, 6, 9, 9a- hexahydro- 6, 9-methano-2, 4, 3-benzodioxathiepin-3- oxide] and one of its main metabolites, endosulfan sulfate, in human serum. In a second bioanalytical method, urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites have been assessed as markers to estimate the exposure to organophosphorus pesticides, focusing on three of the six organophosphorus urinary metabolites, namely dimethyl phosphate, dimethyl thiophosphate and diethyl phosphate. For both the bioanalytical methods, liquid-liquid extraction was used for sample preparation and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry as detection method due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. Chromatographic separation for both bioanalytical methods was achieved by performing reverse phase chromatography on C18 analytical columns. Isocratic elution with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile, methanol and water was employed for the analysis of the organochlorine compounds while the organophosphorus compounds were eluted using gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium acetate. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source operating in the negative ionization mode was used for mass detection of all the analytes, employing multiple reaction monitoring as scan mode. Calibration standards and quality control samples for both analyses were prepared in the biological matrix in which the samples for each determination were collected, i.e. serum for the determination of the organochlorine compounds and stripped urine for the organophosphorus compounds. Deuterated internal standards were used in the bioanalytical method for the determination of the organophosphorus compounds whereas the organochlorine compounds were determined without the use of an internal standard due to unavailability of suitable internal standards. The calibration ranges for the determination of β-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate were 0.8 ng/ml to 200 ng/ml and 0.117 ng/ml to 30 ng/ml, respectively, and 1.0 ng/ml to 30 ng/ml for the dialkylphosphate metabolites of the organophosphorus compounds. These sensitive and robust quantitation methods were successfully applied to quantify 219 serum and 187 urine samples that were collected from agricultural workers with the purpose to determine whether they were exposed to any of the investigated organochlorine or organophosphorus compounds. No traces of β-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate were found in any of the serum samples that were analyzed, however, significant amounts of the three organophosphorus compounds dimethyl phosphate, dimethyl thiophosphate and diethyl phosphate were present in the urine samples.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Forhead box G1 (FoxG1) is a winged-helix transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the telecephalon, the most rostral region of the brain Here, FoxG1 acts as a transcriptional repressor and maintains the population of cortical progenitor cells by promoting their proliferation and inhibiting differrentiation. Vertebrate FoxG1 orthologs have highly conserved DNA-binding and corbosy-terminal domains that have functional roles. Conversely, no functional role has yet been assigned to the N-terminal domain which shows a high degree of variability across vertebrates, with a remarkable stretch of consecutive histidine, proline and glutamine (HPQ) residues in the mammalian orthologs. In this study it was tested whether differences in FoxG1 sequence amongst vertebrates might account for the increased cortex size of mammals compared to non-mammals. Furthermore, changes in the sub-cellular localization of FoxG1 in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) were investigated in a neural precursor cell line.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Is The Learning Curve In Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomies (RALP) in South Africa Comparable to International Standards?</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>de Jager, Simon</dc:creator>

   <dc:description>Background and purpose   Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men, and the sixth leading cause of cancer death among men worldwide (1). Radical Prostatectomy (RP) is widely considered a gold standard treatment for clinically significant localized PCa. Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) represents a modern minimally invasive technique for performing a RP. The aim of the study is to demonstrate a progression in the learning curve of two South Africa based urologists, as each embarks on their first series of RALP cases between September 2014 to July 2019. An audit of peri-operative outcomes for each surgeon's first uninterrupted series of RALP's has been undertaken. We also compare our results to international series to assess if local South African outcomes are similar to these.   Materials and Methods   We performed a retrospective audit of all patients who had a RALP with our two urologists between the dates of September 2014 to May 2019. Patients were only excluded if critical data could not be collected. For each included patient we collected peri-operative data. Pre-operative data collected was required for risk stratification grouping of patients according the D'Amico Risk group classification. Post-operative data included operative details (such as console time and blood loos), functional outcomes (such as potency and continence rates), and pathological outcomes (such a T-staging and positive surgical margin rates). The total number of patients for each of the two surgeons have been divided into a series of consecutive groups. The first 100 have been divided into groups of 25, and the subsequent patients into groups of 50.   Results/main findings   Our two surgeons have been designated Surgeon-X and Surgeon-Y. A total of 700 patients met our inclusion criteria, 400 and 300 cases for Surgeons-X and -Y respectively. Our study demonstrates that in a South Africa setting, for the parameters of median console time (CT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), and positive surgical margins (PSM), there were notable improvements between the first and last groups of each surgeon's series. Although each parameter tends to fluctuate around a median value, there is a general trend towards improved outcomes. For the parameters of post-operative continence and potency our study failed to show a statistically significant improvement in outcomes between the first and last groups in each surgeon's series.  Conclusions   This study demonstrates that, similar to internationally published data, notable improvements in perioperative outcomes can be observed as each of our two surgeons gain experience in this relatively new operative approach to managing men with localized prostate cancer. The overall picture is one of improved outcomes with each consecutive group analysed and that when individually assessed, these outcomes display differing rates of improvement depending on which is being assessed. When analysing our outcomes of CT, EBL, PSM rate and LOS, we see that our results compare favourably to other internationally published data. For all intents and purposes our learning curve and peri-operative results are on par with our overseas counterparts and in some cases bette</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This qualitative research aims to identify the threshold concepts in financial instruments using Meyer and Land's Threshold Concept Framework (2005) and applies the dimension of Semantics and Legitimation Code Theory (Maton, 2014) to analyse whether semantic gravity and semantic density are stronger or weaker in the threshold concepts. The analysis points to five threshold concepts in the financial instruments module. It further aims to explore whether African, Coloured and Indian students' exposure to these threshold concepts results in troublesome knowledge and/or transformation in understanding and thinking in a second-year Accounting course at a South African university. Triangulation is used to confirm the authenticity and consistency of the data emerging from the identification of the threshold concepts. Using Semantics, this research illustrates that the five threshold concepts possess weaker semantic gravity due to the abstract nature of the threshold concepts and stronger semantic density is present due to the complex and dense terminology inherent in financial instruments. Evidence from a general survey, interviews and summative assessments conducted with students registered for an Accounting course shows that exposure to the threshold concepts resulted in troublesome knowledge and/or transformed understanding. Identifying the threshold concepts could make specialised Accounting knowledge more explicit to students and exploring the knowledge experienced as troublesome and the transformed understanding experienced provides room for debate around pedagogy and curriculum reform.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>There have been major changes in the electricity supply industry in most parts of the world. In South Africa, the government intends to restructure and/or introduce competition in the ESI. The need to reform, to introduce competition and/or to privatise power utilities is primarily aimed at boosting their efficiencies, although other reform drivers such as facilitation of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and mobilisation of private capital should not be neglected. There are, however, conflicting opinions concerning ESI reform and/or privatisation in South Africa. On the one hand, the advocates of power sector reform and privatisation argue that South Africa's existing ESI is not efficient and therefore must be restructured, thereafter competition must be introduced in the industry to boost its efficiency and the quality of its supply. On the other hand, the opponents of reform and competition argue persuasively that the ESI (particularly Eskom) is performing well, because Eskom is currently selling electricity at a lower price than many (if not all) other utilities in the world while nevertheless still earning a profit. As performance improvements ultimately result in lower prices and high quality services, many attribute Eskom's comparatively low prices to an efficient operational performance and are of the opinion that the organisation does not need to be restructured. However, low operational costs do not necessarily imply that all efficiency improvements have been realised and may, in part, be due to factors such as low fuel costs. Furthermore, whilst improvements in operational performance do indeed reduce operating costs, investment efficiency, which has an even longer-term impact, reduces the proportion of capital-related costs in the electricity price. In this regard, the South African government's intention to restructure the ESI should not be mistakenly ascribed to its aim of improving Eskom's operational performance only but rather to its wish to achieve a number of objectives including improved investment efficiency and also attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A grounded theory study of family caregivers' responses to the sexuality of young adults with intellectual disabilities</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Globally, people with intellectual disabilities are not afforded equal opportunities to express and enjoy their sexuality on par with their peers. Although most of them remain under the lifetime custody of family caregivers for care and support, a knowledge gap exists in understanding the role of the family caregivers in the sexuality issues of people with intellectual disabilities, especially in developing countries like South Africa. The present study is the first of its kind that employed an exploratory, theory generating methodology, the constructivist grounded theory methodology, to seek understanding of how family caregivers in the Western Cape Province of South Africa respond to sexuality of young adults with intellectual disabilities. Data were gathered through in-depth and focus group interviews with 25 family caregivers and further confirmatory interviews with nine service providers of young adults with intellectual disabilities. The study generated a substantive grounded theory, the Theory of Contained Sexuality, to explain the responses of family caregivers to the sexuality of young adults with intellectual disabilities. The study found that the family caregivers' thoughts, emotions, actions and behaviour towards the sexuality of the young adults with intellectual disabilities are influenced by what the family caregivers see as implications of the young adults' sexual expression and behaviour on both of them. The family caregivers do not completely suppress or restrain the sexuality of the young adults with intellectual disabilities but they support with 'containment', that is they try to confine the sexuality within boundaries that they can control and manage within their lifelong caring role. Ultimately, what the findings of this study point towards is the impact of lifelong family care on realisation of sexual rights by people with intellectual disabilities. Hence, the study concluded that, without the appropriate forms of support and probably alternative forms of care, the human rights framework as embodied within the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and local policies informed by it is insufficient as a tool for sexual emancipation of people with intellectual disabilities. Therefore, a relational moral theory - the ethics of care - is proposed as appropriate to complement the human rights framework in both research and practice around sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities living under family care. The study also highlights the imperative for further studies that investigate the impact of lifelong family care on other aspects of the lives of people with intellectual disabilities and promote theorisation of lifelong care within such studies.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis examines the growing partnership between Russia and the ED. Although suspicious of each other's intentions at times, both sides have realized the necessity for close cooperation. In many respects, the ED is an economic empire in search of a security structure, while Russia is a military power without an economic base. The crime, corruption, and slowly developing democracy in Russia are of supreme security concern for the EU, because they create instability and uncertainty in the region.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The central purpose of this paper is to assess whether the South African intergovernmental fiscal relations system enables provinces to achieve preference matching, efficiency and accountability. In the final analysis the paper contests that the system does not enable preference matching because of centralized policy making, provincial over reliance on national transfers to finance their expenditures and the fact that the system was not necessarily crafted for purposes of preference matching but national unity and the need to address the imbalances of the past.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The research described in this thesis is an investigation of stability of short arcs. It is on fault tolerant medium voltage distribution networks. It serves to describe experimental findings of the investigation of stability of short (1000mm) arcs. The instability of short arcs with high source impedance may be exploited to improve the lightning performance of medium voltage distribution lines. Lightning initiated flashovers on distribution networks do not necessary lead to power follow current. This subject has been the cause for concern to various authors as far back as the 1930 and 1940. But from the literature search that has been done in this thesis there is not enough information about the effect of high source impedance on arc quenching. A thorough literature search has been done to establish work that has been done by these authors. Some work was reported by Darveniza [1], but without details of the dynamic response. Most of the work on arc quenching and electric properties of wood was done by Darveniza [1]. Various developed arc-quenching techniques are highlighted in this document. The arc behaviour is then discussed without going into the details of plasma physics. The general characteristics and dynamics of AC arcs that are discussed include inter alia the voltage versus current (V-I) characteristic, extinction methods under different circuit parameters and re-ignition of arcs as discussed by Cobine [33]. A range of tests were performed in the newly built medium voltage laboratory at the University of Cape Town. Preliminary tests at low voltage (230V) were performed to establish the possible trends of the arc behaviour and from which the measurement and control circuits were established. This involved initiating an arc channel at different voltages up to 40kV in air and along wood surface path.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Sinonasal tumours have been resected endoscopically at Groote Schuur Hospital Cape Town South Africa since 2003. Surgery, although seen as minimally invasive because no external incisions are visible, is often very aggressive and destructive to the nasal structures. The removal of the nasal turbinates has always been seen as sacrilege due to the risk of developing atrophic rhinitis. If the theory regarding developing atrophic rhinitis after a simple turbinectomy stands true, one would expect a high incidence of atrophic rhinitis after radical resection of the sinonasal structures. This has not been our experience. METHODS: The study population includes a retrospective case review of all patients that had endoscopic sinonasal tumour resection by the same surgeon between 2006 and 2010. All patients were assessed for symptoms and signs suggestive of atrophic rhinitis up to two years post resection. RESULTS: 51 patients (34M: 17F) were included in the study. Patients with residual or recurrent tumour (n=19) and patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy (n=17) had a statistically significant chance of developing symptoms and signs suggestive of atrophic rhinitis over time. Variables such as age, gender, extent of surgery, bilateral disease, benign or malignant tumour, were not statistically significant in the development of symptoms and signs suggestive of atrophic rhinitis over time. CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic rhinitis is not more common in patients who undergo endoscopic sinonasal surgery without adjuvant therapy. However, patients with residual tumour (after debulking surgery) or recurrent tumour and those who had received adjuvant radiotherapy had a statistically significant chance of developing symptoms and signs suggestive of atrophic rhinitis over time. Keywords: atrophic rhinitis, endoscopic resection, turbinectomy, medial maxillectomy, sinonasal tumours.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In an attempt to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the expression of the human α2(I) procollagen gene, cis-acting DNA-elements within the proximal promoter were identified and their corresponding trans-acting factors characterised. The fibroblast cell lines used in this study had previously been transformed with either simian virus 40 (SVWI-38) or by γ-radiation (CT-1). The SVWI-38 fibroblasts do not produce any α2(I) collagen chains, whereas the CT-1 cell line produces normal type I collagen. Previous studies suggested that trans-acting factor(s) may be responsible for the inactivation of the α2(I) procollagen gene in SVWI-38 fibroblasts (Parker et. al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem 264, 7147-7152; Parker et. al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 5825-5830). In this study, the SVWI-38 proximal promoter (-350 to +54) was sequenced and shown to be normal, thereby ruling out any possibility that mutations within this region was responsible for inactivation of the gene.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>‘Do I even belong?' Interrogating Afro-diasporic navigation of identity, race and space in the search for belonging</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The departure point for this creative project is based on my experience as an African living in diaspora. While I felt many things during my time ‘away' from the African continent, one constant was always this feeling of unbelonging, and this need to find belonging. As such, this project centers around the theme ‘finding belonging in diaspora'. Growing up in Kenya, I had never really come to terms with the politics of my Kenyanness not to mention my blackness. I had simply just been me. While in Kenya, the only real identifiers I had to contend with that carried heavy politics were my gender and my tribal affiliation. After leaving Kenya and arriving in Canada for school at the age of 16, for the first time in my life I felt black and I felt African. Both identities I felt did not belong in this Canadian space. Over the course of 9 years, I lived in both Canada and London and neither ever warmed me like home. In most, if not all the predominantly white spaces I frequented, I always felt too little of something and too much of something else. As such,, I found myself intentionally and unintentionally drawn to those like me, in colour, in language, and culture. It is only today I have realised that those intentional and unintentional unions I formed were a result of my search for belonging, which I came to find is common in the diaspora experience. Ann Hua, a black diaspora scholar, defines diaspora as a community of people who have been dispersed from their homeland to other locations because of genocide, slavery, migration, and war (Hua, 2013; 31). It's important to note that for many, induction into the Afro-diaspora is involuntary. As Hua notes, political unrest, genocide, war, and slavery has forced many to leave their homes and either seek asylum or become indentured laborers elsewhere. We have seen this throughout the eras, from the 15th-century trans-Atlantic slave trade, capturing of Africans, transporting them to the Americas and coercing them into slavery (Gates Jr., 2017), to the 20th-century dispersion of Rwandese nationals fleeing genocide§ (Guichaoua, André &amp;amp; Webster, Don E. 2015). The identity of diaspora comes in both anticipated and unanticipated ways. Fortunately, my induction into the Afro-diasporic community was a voluntary one and the bulk of this project interacts with voluntary Afro-diasporic migrants. During my time in Canada and London, I met many members of the Afro-diasporic community who ended up in these countries in a variety of different ways and for a variety of different reasons. The theme of ‘finding belonging' was omnipresent among my fellow Afro-diasporic community members and it would manifest itself in various ways. For instance, wanting to go to African restaurants to feel more ‘at-home', or wanting to visit African night clubs to listen to more music from ‘home'. Interestingly, I also began to see that this journey towards ‘finding belonging' also manifested in Afro-diasporic communities rejecting assimilation into their new societies and creating spaces of resistance, through organising protests or hosting discussions that centred around issues of race.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Conversion of hydrocarbons to biosurfactants : an insight into the bioprocess optimisation of biosurfactant production using alkanes as inducers</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Surfactants are chemical compounds that are able to alter interfacial properties, particularly surface tension. When they are biologically produced, the term biosurfactant is used. One of the most important groups of biosurfactants is a family of chemical compounds known as glycolipids, whose structure consists of a sugar group and a lipid tail. Glycolipids are subdivided into three main groups: rhamnolipids, sophorolipids and trehalolipids, named following their sugar moieties, respectively rhamnose, trehalose and sophorose. Biosurfactants exhibit attractive advantages over chemical surfactants. Examples of these are biodegradability, low toxicity, and effectiveness at extreme temperature, pH and salinity. The objective of the present research project was, first, to investigate the potential of liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons to induce biosurfactant production by the bacterium Ps. aeruginosa 2Bf isolated based on its ability to metabolise alkanes. The second objective was to optimise biosurfactant production using alkanes as sole carbon and energy source, through optimising the mixing &amp; aeration conditions, media conditions as well as provision of alkane, in a stirred tank batch reactor system. The final objective was to describe the biosurfactant formed. Experiments were organised in three major series: the exploratory shake flask based experiments, the bioreactor-based experiments to optimise biosurfactant production and characterise biokinetics and performance, and the biosurfactant characterisation experiments. Following review of a number of methods, microbial cell counts were selected as the most reproducible measure of biomass formation in the presence of alkanes. The presence of biosurfactant was quantified functionally in terms of the emulsification index and alteration of surface tension. Using a shake flask-based study, nitrogen source was investigated in terms of biomass and biosurfactant synthesis. Four pre-selected nitrogen sources were tested in order to select the best for bioreactor based study. These nitrogen sources consisted of specific combinations of three nitrogen compounds, NH4NO3, NaNO3 and (NH4)2SO4. During the study, long chain liquid n-alkanes were used as sole carbon source and the C/N ratio maintained at the value of 18.6 in mass terms. Results confirmed that both a combination of NO3 ' and NH4+ ions or a nitrogen source composed solely of NH4+ ions were suitable for biomass growth and biosurfactant production. (NH4)SO4 was used as the N-source of choice in the remainder of the study. While the C14-C17 alkanes cut was the carbon source of interest in the study, two pure alkanes, n-C12 and n-C16 were tested and compared to the C14-C17 blend. The C14-C17 fraction, sourced as an industrial byproduct, compared favourably as a carbon source with respect to hexadecane and dodecane. ii Biosurfactant production was not observed in Ps. aeruginosa 2Bf cultures where glucose was the sole carbon source and the bacteria were not previously exposed to linear alkanes. Using a mixed carbon source of glucose and alkane, or on pre-exposure of the bacteria to alkane, biosurfactant production was induced. Induction was optimised where alkane was the sole carbon source over a period of four sub-culture steps. In the quantitative optimisation of biosurfactant production through the bioreactor based study, mixing and aeration were optimised; agitation and aeration proved to be equally important, the first at intermediate rates, the second at lower rates. Their interaction, when maximum biomass was used as the variable for response, was found to be important for agitation rates up to 500 rpm. Beyond this range of agitation speed, the interaction between aeration and agitation became negligible. In the case of Eindex as the variable for response, similar results were obtained with regard to the impact of the interaction between aeration and agitation on the process. It was significant from lower to intermediate agitation rates, and negligible from intermediate to higher rates of agitation. Lower aeration rate was found to enhance the oxygen utilisation rate, while mass transfer was relatively favoured by high aeration rate. Regarding the emulsification power of the product, quantitative tests were carried out on culture suspension, supernatant prepared by centrifugation and supernatant prepared by centrifugation and filtration at 0.22&amp;Icirc;&amp;frac14;m pore size filters. Results showed that some emulsification effect was lost through centrifugation and filtration. This loss of emulsification effect was more pronounced in the filtration case, thus showing that some biosurfactant was removed along some other material or substance through sticking on filter paper. Foam control was required, and two mechanical foam breakers were compared to anti-foam reagent. It was experimentally established that mechanical foam breakers are preferable to chemical anti-foam reagents. On comparing the two different mechanical foam breakers, the modified two blade paddle with three slits, FB-2, performed better than the simple two blade paddle foam breaker, FB-1. Further investigations showed that the interaction between type of foam control and agitation rate was negligible throughout the process. The Biosurfactant was characterised at the structural level and the antibiotic potential of Ps. aeruginosa 2Bf's biosurfactant was analysed. In addition to the thin layer chromatography, three different spectroscopic methods (mass, infrared &amp; nuclear magnetic resonance) were used to study the chemical structure of the biosurfactant produced. Up to six rhamnolipid structures were tentatively identified with spectrometric analysis whereas only four to five structures could be detected with thin layer chromatography. Possession of an anti-microbial activity by the rhamnolipids produced was confirmed with the B. subtilis inhibition test.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation is an attempt to extract architecture from the site itself. Michelangelo, the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer, famously said, Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. He clearly understood his role as the vessel by which an idea came to life in the physical world. In this light, the chosen site is treated much like a block of marble in the hands of a sculptor (the architect) and this dissertation is the documentation of the slow shaping, polishing, and final revealing of an idea. The design is conducted within the speculative future of the Breakwater in Cape Town Harbour. Two main interests are outlined: 1. Landscape: a desire to better understand architecture as the mediator between man and nature, essentially, and to view landscape as architecture and architecture as landscape through the dissolution of convention and the celebration of the imagination. Architectural space is treated as an extension of the site. 2. Rebirth: waste, as a by-product of contemporary consumer culture, is defined as something which no longer has value, something which is superfluous. The technological arm of this investigation is focused on the process of spatially re-imagining the breakwater site through the use de-constructed shipping vessels (machines which have become outdated and can no longer function in the post-industrial/information age). The main focus on landscape and rebirth filters through into the design of the Iziko Cape Town Maritime Museum to accurately represent the project's development from its theoretical founding to its speculative architectural resolution. Overall, this dissertation is focused on pushing the boundaries of spatial experience through the adaptation and re-imagining of a decommissioned ship. We know very well how to make good buildings which are comfortable and comply with council and environmental regulations. This endeavour is aimed at exploring new possibilities.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Social and economic decision-making in Urbach-Wiethe Disease</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: Rodent and primate research have identified the basolateral amygdala as indispensable for social decision-making. This finding has not yet been translated to humans, and has even been partially contradicted by previous findings in patients with amygdala lesions that show generous economic investments in strangers. This thesis therefore aimed to determine whether selective basolateral amygdala damage in humans, caused by Urbach-Wiethe Disease, impairs instrumental non-social economic decision-making. Methods: Using an adapted reinforcement-learning task, the performance of basolateral amygdala damaged individuals (n=6) was compared with that of healthy controls (n=20) on social and economic decision-making during a probabilistic reinforcement task. The task required participants to make decisions for themselves and others based on learned probability of monetary reward or loss. A random effects Generalised Least Squares regression was conducted using Stata 15.1. to assess discrimination between Gain and Loss domains. A social-decision making task was also administered. Results: When making choices for themselves, Urbach-Wiethe Disease participants showed no difference in correct choices made between Gain and Loss domains. The Urbach-Wiethe disease participant's lack of discrimination between gains and losses for themselves was significantly different (p&lt; 0.01) from that of controls, who made significantly more correct choices for themselves in the gain domain compared to the Loss domain. Social decision-making performance did not, however, differ significantly between Urbach-Wiethe Disease participants and controls. Conclusions: These findings regarding non-social decision-making support the important role of the basolateral amygdala as a salience detector, with lesions to this region resulting in reduced bias to the valence of potential economic outcomes, regardless of whether these pertain to costs or benefits. These findings are also consistent with prior work indicating that lesions to the basolateral amygdala can possibly produce loss-aversion due to a hypervigilance for fear and the lack of inhibition of the centromedial amygdala by the basolateral amygdala.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In this thesis we address the problem of improving the uplink capacity and the performance of a DS-CDMA system by combining MUD and turbo decoding. These two are combined following the turbo principle. Depending on the concatenation scheme used, we divide these receivers into the Partitioned Approach (PA) and the Iterative Approach (IA) receivers. To enable the iterative exchange of information, these receivers employ a Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) detector as the first receiver stage.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Thabo Mbeki : State of the Nation Addresses - an analysis of his rhetorical technique</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The dissertation analyses the rhetorical style of Thabo Mbeki with the aim of evaluating whether his oratory was effective enough to convince his audience to support him. It does this by analysing four of the eleven annual addresses that he delivered at the occasion of the Opening of Parliament during his period in office. Mbeki held the position of President of South Africa from June 1999 to September 2008. The speeches that were chosen for analysis from this period are 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2008. The motivation for these choices is related to critical periods during the Mbeki presidency. Before analysing the speeches, the paper examines the context in detail by briefly outlining Mbeki's political and personal background in order to understand his identity in relation to his rhetoric. The current form of annual address at the opening of Parliament is placed in its historical context It also places the type of speech in context in terms of parliamentary rules and the South African Constitution and does a brief comparison with similar addresses in the United States of America and Britain. A key aspect of the dissertation is to attempt to identify how he possibly failed to gain the support his audience by missing the opportunities that his annual address to Parliament presented. In order to identity the disjuncture between the style and content of the oration and the audience. the dissertation examines the understanding of audience and speculates about the real and perceived audiences in the case of Mbeki's annual addresses. The annual address to Parliament provided Mbeki with an opportunity to speak to the nation. directly through the various forms of media as well as through the members of Parliament that were present at the addresses. The dissertation concludes that, on the basis of the in-depth rhetorical analyses of the speeches and the perception of the audience. Mbeki's form of oration resulted in him appearing distant and aloof to his audience. Mbeki used Eurocentric language and metaphors that the audience was not able to identify with thereby failing to unite the audience in support for him. He failed to use presidential rhetoric to his advantage in his speeches in Parliament but further failed to bolster the rhetorical presidency by not establishing his ethos with the people whose support he depended on in order to secure his position in office. By maintaining a strong adherence to the British notion of a president-in-parliament, he remained aloof and wasted the opportunity that the office of the President provided. While his policies may have been sound. he was not able to convince his audience of this causing him ultimately to fail.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Recent Developments in South African Consumer Insolvency Law - An analysis of the National Credit Amendment Act 7 of 2019 and its possible impact on the economy, taking into account the experiences of the British, New Zealand and German legal systems</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>International Law</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>A key challenge of the present is the growing number of consumer debtors, often caused by easy access to credit. Especially for people on low incomes, even an unforeseen event can lead to a situation in which credit rates can no longer be serviced. The result is insolvency. However, in the past many jurisdictions were not prepared for the challenges of low income insolvency. It was not until more recent times that legislators began to develop special insolvency procedures tailored to people with low incomes. This comparative research presents the insolvency proceedings of South Africa, in particular the recently introduced low income insolvency proceedings, and compares them with those of New Zealand, Great Britain and Germany, whereby Germany is the only one of these countries without a low-income insolvency procedure. It is established that each of these proceedings has advantages and disadvantages. It is also noted that despite the existence of insolvency proceedings, the number of consumer debtors continues to rise. Therefore, in addition to a proposal for insolvency proceedings combining the feasible aspects of each of the legal systems presented, it is also proposed to teach financial literacy at school in order to prevent over-indebtedness.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Deriving a rate equation for the removal of manganese from solution using a gas mixture of sulphur dioxide and oxygen</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Schulze-Messing, Jacobus</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>Chemical Engineering</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The use of a sulfur dioxide - oxygen gas mixture to selectively remove manganese from other metals, such as cobalt and nickel, from leach solutions is kinetically favourable and inexpensive. However, this technology for precipitating manganese has not been used commercially, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the reaction mechanism by which the sulfur dioxide - oxygen gas mixture oxidises the manganese and the need to control the concentration of aqueous sulfur dioxide in the solution to ensure oxidising conditions. From the literature, the gas mixture is postulated to form a free radical in solution which in turn oxidises the manganese(lI) into the manganese(lIl) species, which can precipitate as manganese oxides (Mn02, Mn203, etc.). Due to the complicated and unknown reaction pathways for the oxidation of the manganese by the sulfur dioxide oxygen gas mixture, a need arose to describe the rate at which the manganese is precipitated from solution, not in terms of the exact species responsible for the oxidation, but rather as a function of the easily measurable operating parameters. From the literature, the operating parameters identified as playing a role in the rate of manganese precipitation are: the gas composition; the dissolved sulfur dioxide concentration; the dissolved oxygen concentration; the solution temperature, and the solution pH. To derive the relationship between the rate of manganese precipitation and each of the operating parameters, batch tests were conducted where one of the operating parameters was varied at a time. The dissolved sulfur species arising from the dissolution of the sulfur dioxide gas were not kept constant during the batch tests due to the high solubility of sulfur dioxide in water (the concentration of the dissolved sulfur species increased throughout all of the batch experiments). However, each of the operating parameters could be assessed as long as the concentration of the sulfur species in solution increased at the same rate for every test.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Globalization and the political economy of post-apartheid South Africa : the possibilities and constraints for an African state</dc:title>

   <dc:description>There have been many perspectives and arguments put forward to describe the current state of post-apartheid South Africa's political economy. These have generally tended to depend on which side of the ideological spectrum one resides. Due to the chronic levels of poverty and inequality that South Africa faces, debates on economic policy have become fundamental to the new regime. Many have become perplexed and frustrated by the ruling party's approach to this debate. This is as the broad democratic movement was always thought to favour social policies when presented with political economic thesis. Whilst others believe that government has played too great a role post-1994 and should take more of a back-seat in favour of the market. The result has been a debate which has moved beyond the ideological stand-offs of the past, to a new arena of contradictions and practical analysis. What is clear is that the ANC has fundamentally shifted its economic philosophy since the context of liberation and struggle. This research seeks to make sense of this evolution and to present a theme of pragmatism and convergence.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The key to understanding my project lies in the assumption that the task of representation for contemporary painting is different from that of newer media such as photography and film. I see the role of painting as being the representation of the past; an engagement with history. Many of the painters who have inspired my way of seeing are artists who re-imagined the role of pre-modernist narrative painting and re-asserted it in contemporary practice. Contemporary narrative painting occupies a different role from that of its pre-modernist predecessors, such as Romantic painting. It also occupies a different role in relation to dominant narrative media of photography and film.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A Prima Facie assessment of the prevalence of certain emotional biases in the investment decisions of South African students</dc:title>

   <dc:description>This study investigates the prevalence of emotional biases that influence South African students' decision-making in an investment context. This study advances the understanding of whether the future financial professionals of South Africa are susceptible to irrational decision-making due to the influence of emotional biases. A questionnaire-based survey was employed to test whether a sample of South African finance students exhibit emotional biases that influence their investment decision-making. The questionnaire posited investment scenarios to which the students would answer intuitively based on the information that was provided to them. This study asked the students to respond using their &quot;gut-feel&quot; to test whether emotional biases were inherent in their decision-making process. It was found that the respondents were influenced by market trends, otherwise known as the representative bias, making them more susceptible to notice patterns in truly random sequences of data, or making them think that future patterns will resemble previous patterns. 85% of respondents did not show a tendency to anchor to a particular reference point. However, the data showed that 15% of the respondents did not give an answer when asked to answer intuitively, while 100% of the students gave a response when a reference point was introduced. Just over half of respondents exhibited traits of overconfidence, and, consistent with historical research, males exhibited greater overconfidence than females. However, male and female responses showed mixed results in respect of loss aversion scenarios. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that 58% of respondents were partial to choosing options that were framed positively. Finally, there was no significant evidence that respondents were influenced by the herding bias or the illusion of control bias. In summary, this study found at least prima facie evidence of some emotional biases that influence investment decision-making. This conclusion demonstrates a viable basis for future research on the role of emotion (and, pertinently, emotional intelligence) in investment decision-making.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Multidisciplinary management of Complex Regional Pain Syndrom Type 1 in children admitted to Red Cross War Memorial Hospital: A case series describing long-term effects on pain, function and quality of life</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterised by neuropathic-type pain in a regional distribution with associated signs and symptoms including: swelling, change in temperature, change in skin colour and motor dysfunction. Although CRPS is not a common condition, the disease burden is high and can lead to long-term impairment and disability. Current guidelines for the management of paediatric CRPS are mostly extrapolated from adult data. Literature regarding treatment and long-term prognosis of paediatric CRPS is sparse and often lacks well-defined and reproducible outcome measures. Aim: This study aims to assess the efficacy of treatment of CRPS Type 1 in children admitted to Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH) in eliminating pain and improving function. Methods A retrospective folder review and follow-up telephonic survey of all children admitted to RCWMCH over a 5 year period was performed. Long-term follow-up was defined as a minimum of 6 months after discharge from hospital. Follow-up questionnaires included the Faces Pain Scale, and the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4 generic core scales (PedsQL 4.0) Results: Nine children with confirmed CRPS Type1 were included in the study, all of whom participated in long-term follow-up. Children received in-hospital treatment from a multidisciplinary team, including intensive physiotherapy and psychological therapy. Pharmacological treatment consisted of an intravenous ketamine infusion and varying combinations of gabapentin, clonidine and amytriptilline. One child received epidural local anaesthetic infusion. On average, pain scores improved by 67.8% by the time of discharge. At an average long-term follow-up interval of 10.3 months (ranging between 6 to 21 months), the pain score had worsened by 10.5% compared to discharge. Two children (22.2%) experienced complete recovery while the remainder experienced partial recovery. Three children (33.3%) suffered a relapse, of which one recovered completely. At long-term follow-up, children for whom PedsQL 4.0 data was available from admission all demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in all four functional domains (physical, social, emotional and school). Children scored on average similar to healthy peers in terms of social, emotional and school function, but worse in terms of overall quality of life. The area most affected was that of physical function, in which children with CRPS scored worse than other children with chronic health conditions. Conclusion: Children with CRPS experience significant improvement in pain and function with an in-patient, multidisciplinary, non-invasive treatment approach. Most children return to a level of school functioning comparable to healthy peers. However, the rate of complete recovery is low, relapse is common, and most children have significant persistent impairment of physical function. We recommend a long-term support program for children with CRPS and their families, and standardisation of follow-up intervals and outcome measures to enable comparison between future studies.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background  Pneumonia, diarrhoea and perinatal factors are the foremost killers of South African children as in other low- and middle-income countries. Poverty, poor access to care and pre-hospital care are reported major pre-hospital factors and lack of triage, poor skills, delays, poor adherence to treatment protocols and inadequate emergency care determining mortality have been reported to increase in-hospital mortality.  Objectives  To describe the clinical presentation and management of children admitted via the medical emergency unit (MEU) of the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH) who subsequently died.  Methods  We did a retrospective study undertaking a cross-sectional review of children who died following admission via RCWMCH MEU in 2008. Demographic information, clinical data, time factors and mortality data were reviewed and summarised by descriptive and inferential statistics. The unit utilised the WHO Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) triage tool, categorising children into Red (emergency), orange (priority) and Green (non-urgent). Patient management was assessed by means of ETAT and the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) tools, which is used to identify severity of illness and strategize treatment plans accordingly.  Results  A total of 135 children met the inclusion criteria. The crude mortality rate was of 6.25 per 1000 admissions. Of the 135 children who died, 119 (88%) were under five years of age, 33(24%) were HIV-infected, of whom (88%) were under 5 years old. In 67 (50%), a chronic medical condition could be identified while 67 (50 %) were moderately or severely malnourished. There were 29 (22%) deaths within 24 hours of arrival at the MEU. Fifty-five (41%) presented after hours. Community health centres referred 65 (48%) patients, general practitioners referred 20 (15%) and 38 (28%) were self-referred. Ambulance services provided pre-hospital transport to 69 (51%). The two top presenting illnesses in 88 (65%) of the children were acute respiratory illness and acute gastroenteritis. Prior to referral, oxygen was not provided in 57 (59%) children, 35 (71%) with suspected sepsis did not receive antibiotics and glucose was not checked in 39 (80%) with depressed level of consciousness. The median time to ward transfer was 3.23 (IQR: 2.12-4.92) hours. Twelve deaths (9%) occurred in the MEU, 57 (42%) in PICU, 56 (42%) in medical wards and 10 (7%) in specialist wards. The five most common causes of death were acute respiratory infections in 45 (33%), acute gastroenteritis in 27 (20%), septicaemia 22 (16%), meningitis in 13 (10%) and cardiac conditions in 12 (9%) children. Conclusion  The top causes of mortality in this hospital cohort in 2008 were pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, and septicaemia. Using the IMCI and ETAT standard of care, suboptimal management was identified in pre-hospital management, as well as MEU management. Appropriate training and protocol implementation to improve morbidity and mortality should be undertaken.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A baited remote underwater video survey of the Goukamma Marine Protected Area's ichthyofauna and a subsequent community structure comparison with the Betty's Bay, Stilbaai, and Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Areas</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The Goukamma Marine Protected Area (GMPA) along the South African south coast has been in existence since 1990. The MPA encompasses 40.2 km2 of subtidal ocean, 76% of which is made up of sandy substrata and the remainder of which is made of rocky reefs. The imbalance in protected habitat type ratios prompted a proposal for an extension of the MPA's seaward boundary, referred to as the new no-take zone (NNTZ), and a restructuring of its eastern boundary, referred to as the new exploited zone (NEZ). The proposed boundary changes would increase the amount of protected reef by 53% and the overall size of the MPA by 38%. Goukamma has been surveyed using controlled angling surveys (CAS) and underwater visual census (UVC) but has yet to be surveyed using baited remote underwater video (BRUV). I collected and analysed mono-BRUV data over five years to determine patterns in fish community structure in Goukamma and compare it to the pre-existing CAS and UVC data. BRUVs are less invasive and more robust than the other two survey methods and have the potential to become the predominant method of surveying ichthyofaunal communities in South Africa. This work is therefore also intended as a baseline BRUV survey. BRUVs were deployed in Goukamma from 2013 to 2017. The survey produced 328 successful deployment records between 5-41.5 m across reef and sand sites. Date, site coordinates, depth, habitat type, protection zone were used as variables to explain patterns in the fish community data. Fish abundances were recorded using the MaxN metric. MaxN counts were recorded at the instance when the highest number of individuals of each species were present in a single video frame. The deployment records were converted into a single data frame and analysed using the RStudio integrated design environment. Ariids, scyliorhinids, serranids, sparids, and triakids were the most well represented ichthyofaunal families in Goukamma. Boopsoidea inornata, Cheimerius nufar, Chrysoblephus laticeps, Galeichthys feliceps, Mustelus mustelus, Pachymetopon aeneum, Poroderma africanum, Poroderma pantherinum, and Spondyliosoma emarginatum were the most frequently observed species throughout the MPA. Habitat type was identified as the primary determinant of diversity and abundance in the GMPA using multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests (species richness: F = 191.155, P &lt; 0.001; relative abundance: F = 96.111, P &lt; 0.001) and Wil coxon signed rank tests (Shannon-Wiener: W = 21 102, P &lt; 0.001; Simpson: W = 18 553, P = 4.85x10-10). The reef sites supported a higher species richness and abundance than sandy sites throughout the MPA (Tukey: q = -4.41, P &lt; 0.001 and q = -2.12, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Diversity and abundance were correlated with each protection zone's predominant habitat type. Exploited zones had significantly higher diversity and abundance than protected zones as a result of the imbalance in Goukamma's protected habitat type ratio (species richness: F = 27.740, P = 7.65x10-16; abundance: F = 10.438, P = 1.51x10-6 ; Shannon-Wiener: W = 17 314, P = 4.58x10-6 ; Simpson: W = 15 896, P = 3.42x10-3 ). The NNTZ had significantly higher species richness and abundance than the NEZ (Tukey: q = 3.07, P &lt; 0.001 and Tukey: q = 1.48, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The proposed changes will therefore substantially boost diversity and abundance of protected fishes in Goukamma. BRUV samples in Goukamma recorded an overall higher species richness and abundance of sparids, chondrichthyans, and other reef-associated species than CAS and UVC samples. Over 90% more chondrichthyans were recorded in the BRUV samples than by the other two methods. BRUVs are therefore considered to be a suitable replacement for CAS and UVC surveys for the monitoring of South Africa's shallow subtidal ichthyofauna. BRUV data from Betty's Bay, Stilbaai, and Tsitsikamma were available for comparison with the Goukamma data, allowing for an extensive analysis of the south coast's ichthyofaunal communities. A combined data frame of 466 successful BRUV deployments from the four study areas was created. Multi-factor ANOVA tests indicated that location (F = 27.1, P = 1.00x103 ), depth zone (F = 17.4, P = 1.00x103 ), protection status (F = 23.1, P = 1.00x103 ), and habitat type (F = 91.8, P = 1.00x103 ) were all significant in determining community structure among the study areas. Reef sites had higher species richness and abundance than sand sites and species richness and abundance decreased from east to west along the south coast according to subtropical subtraction. However, the presence of an additional habitat type in Betty's Bay, namely kelp forests, resulted in it having a higher species richness and abundance than Stilbaai to the east. Betty's Bay's community structure was the least similar to the other three study areas as a result of the localised kelp forests in and around the MPA. These kelp forests shifted Betty's Bay's community structure away from the sparid-dominance observed in Stilbaai, Goukamma, and Tsitsikamma and towards a carangid- and scyliorhinid-dominance. However, cold-water associated sparids such as Pterogymnus laniarius were more abundant in Betty's Bay than the other study areas. Almost 80% of the species recorded among the study areas were represented in two or more of the four MPAs, indicating a good degree of redundancy of protection along the south coast within the depth ranges sampled. These data suggest that the Cape south coast is adequately protected from the perspective of fish representation. Review of the De Hoop, Sardinia Bay, and Bird Island MPAs should be conducted to further examine complementarity and redundancy of protection along South Africa's south coast.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Act local, think global – The aesthetics of success: race and Beauty in the global south: a reflection on South African women content creators' online performances on YouTube and Instagram</dc:title>

   <dc:description>This media creative project explores the experiences of South African women on social media platforms. The idea for this project stems from my personal experiences as an avid consumer and viewer of online content generated by these women. My engagement with YouTube began about ten years ago, when I started to consistently watch YouTube videos. Later, I would go on to consume Instagram posts by digital content creators. However, these consumption choices of mine were not functions of random videos or pictures promoted on these platforms. Rather my consumption was driven by a desire to see women who looked like me - black women. From 2009 onward black diasporic women, and women on the African continent, were suddenly, it seemed, putting out content related to black women's experiences in the world, with themes relating to education, hair, beauty and all other sorts of lifestyle-related topics. I would be lying if I did not mention how the women on YouTube talking about their natural hair drove me to explore a hair routine away from chemicals. Straightening our natural hair and being 'presentable' according to Eurocentric standards were for a long time, a burden into my life. I began consuming their videos whereby the content creators were encouraging the viewers to own their natural hair and most importantly, own whatever hairstyle they seemed to 3 fit. The choice of how we present ourselves seemed to come back to us, and the space in which it was performed felt like a safe, communal one. Six years ago, a black youtuber called Chizi Duru, had cut all her hair to start all over again without any chemicals. The act of cutting off all your hair within the community was labeled 'The Big Chop': an act of rebirth, renewal and resistance for black women. I went along and did the same, following her journey and exploring my own.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Model reconstruction using photoconsistency refers to a method that creates a photohull, an approximate computer model, using multiple calibrated camera views of an object. The term photoconsistency refers to the concept that is used to calculate the photohull from the camera views. A computer model surface is considered photoconsistent if the appearance of that surface agrees with the appearance of the surface of the real world object from all camera viewpoints. This thesis presents the work done in implementing some concepts and approaches described in the literature.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Learnerships in South Africa : the role of workplace adjustment as a mediator between social support and learner performance and satifaction</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The South African economy is hindered by high unemployment, partly due to a lack of required skills in the country. Learnership programmes were implemented to contribute to skills development however there is limited research into the scope, magnitude and outcomes of these programmes. Previous research into learnerships has highlighted the importance of building support structures into these programmes in order to ensure their effectiveness. This study considered the role that workplace adjustment (self-efficacy, role clarity and social acceptance) has on the relationship between social support (co-workers, family, supervisors and mentors) and job satisfaction and self-perceived performance. Results indicated that coworker, supervisor and mentor support are related to performance via their link with workplace adjustment and that family support is related to job satisfaction via its link with workplace adjustment. This research aimed to create awareness about the internal processes and benefits of support personnel within South African learnerships. The results revealed that the quality rather than the number of support sources provided is important. Positive perceptions of support from co-workers, family, supervisors and/ or mentors was related to higher levels of job satisfaction and self-perceived performance. Additionally, learners who perceived the quality of support offered as high were more adjusted to the workplace. The study may not provide an accurate representation of learnerships in South Africa as a result of limitations such as the use of a self-reporting performance measure. Future research may elicit more accurate and representative analysis through the use of interviews or more objective measures when collecting data.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>South African cities have been shaped by the country's colonial rule, followed by the era of Apartheid. During Apartheid the majority of South Africans were forced to live on the periphery of cities far away from opportunities that were found in city centres, causing stark social, economic and spatial polarisation. Since the end of Apartheid many, including planners, have been attempting to address these imbalances across the country. One of these imbalances includes access to educational opportunities. There is a clear lack of research on learner transportation within South African cities and receives very little attention in legislation and policy. Learner mobility is therefore the focus of this study and the research aims to identify barriers to learner mobility and ways in which spatial planning can respond to these barriers. Objectives of the study therefore include identifying barriers and exploring learner mobility patterns and travel experiences. To conduct the study, surveys, field observations and a spatial analysis was undertaken within a local precinct in Cape Town, namely Claremont. Surveys were distributed to learners within the area in order to gather data on learner mobility patterns. The guiding spatial plan for Claremont, the Southern District Plan was critiqued and analysed along with the findings from the surveys to identify the barriers to learner mobility and the ways in which spatial planning can respond. The research revealed that the dominance of the private motor vehicle, the inability to integrate land use and transport planning, safety while travelling and the lack of youth participation in planning are the four critical issues that need to be addressed to improve access to education across Cape Town and overcome the barriers to learner mobility. If the interface between land use and transport planning could be implemented correctly and for the right reasons, with safety and youth participation in mind, social equity, spatial equity and increased accessibility to education can become a reality. It is hoped that this research be a useful contribution to begin the shift of the South African city to one that is more inclusive of its children through the use of spatial planning and can increase learner mobility and access to education.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>An evaluation conducted by the Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust (RCCTT) revealed that over 43% of their clients were teenagers, and a preliminary search of the current literature revealed a dearth of studies on the interplay between the developmental stage of adolescence and treatment of the adolescent rape survivor. This study therefore aimed to explore factors to consider when devising treatment strategies for this unique client group. Individual and focus group interviews with clinical practitioners, Rape Crisis staff members, and lay counsellors from each of the Rape Crisis Centres in the Western Cape, who had worked with rape survivors in this age group, were conducted, using an open-ended, semi-structured interview schedule. A grounded theory analysis of participants' experiences of working with adolescent rape survivors was then carried out. Patterns that emerged from this data tended to focus on basic guidelines that the practitioners' followed, the influence of the family and social systems on the therapeutic process, and the challenges that practitioners experienced in working therapeutically with these adolescents. This data was then combined with literature in the areas of trauma, adolescent development, and treatment strategies. The findings demonstrated that victimization in the stage of adolescence is a complex phenomenon that calls for maintaining a 'paradoxical position' by the practitioner, and that requires a multidimensional approach to treatment. On the basis of the findings, four broad categories, including 1) the stage of recovery of the client, 2) symptoms and behaviours present, 3) level of development the adolescent is functioning at, and 4) the influence of the system on the adolescent's healing, were suggested as starting points for planning interventions, and a number of treatment strategies that materialized from the study were discerned under these categories. Recommendations for future research were then proposed to further the body of knowledge in this field.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>With the growing use of non-linear loads and due to their ever changing nature, electricity networks experience power imbalance continually. These non-linear asymmetrical loads draw distorted unbalanced currents and voltages at the point of common coupling (PCC) which propagate into the distribution network. Power quality has therefore become an important issue, which has resulted in the development of numerous control strategies and other interventions to maintain the integrity of the electric network. Recent advancements in power electronics have provided new ways to optimize power systems by regulating the active power transfer. These developments lead to opportunities for renewable energy systems to harness energy and at the same time inject optimized currents into the network by means of distributed units. An emerging problem with most such units is that they are located far from the PCC and are usually designed for the small linear loads. Moreover, the problem is exacerbated during overload conditions when the voltage level drops below the allowed minimum level due to the high network impedance which characterizes a weak grid. This thesis aims to study similar scenarios where a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) is integrated into a weak AC grid. The system comprises of a machine-side (MSC) and a grid-side (GSC) converter, which provides available ancillary services and is envisaged to augment existing power quality conditioners such as STATCOM devices. To represent a weak grid, a Thevenin equivalent model of the electric network is considered with unbalanced loads. The main objective of this project is to transform the traditional converter topology into a versatile system that can perform as a power conditioner. In particular, it monitors a distribution line, sense changes in the load, detects faults and redistributes the currents to ensure maximized power transfer into the network. The system under consideration possesses the capability of independent injection of active and reactive currents within the defined limits. Since the system under consideration is integrated v into a weak grid, the perceived load is always considered to be unbalanced. Under the specified condition, if a fault occurs at one or two phases, unbalanced voltages are observed at the PCC. Two scenarios are created to perform the case study. Firstly, a no-fault case is considered with symmetrical voltages at the PCC. To ensure maximum power transfer into the network with least losses, a set of currents is injected according to the optimal current injection technique. Secondly, asymmetrical faults are considered at the PCC and currents are injected according to the coordinated sequence current injection technique. This technique defines a new current injection limit which not only improves the power transfer but also enhances the power factor. Furthermore, the peak magnitude of the three phase currents is also kept within the rated current limit. For both scenarios described above, the MSC regulates the DC link voltage so as to limit the active power coming from the generator according to the grid condition. The GSC however performs two important functions. It implements small active/reactive power perturbations for the impedance estimation, and once the impedances are determined, magnitudes of the required currents are calculated and injected based on the proposed techniques. Validation of the analysis is done experimentally on a 3.3kW PMSG connected to a programmable regenerative power supply which emulates a weak grid. The MSC and GSC utilized in this project are conventional two-level converters which are controlled by means of a FPGA based controller.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The Great Lakes region, where conflict resolution and peace operations have been a challenge for 40 years, has been the site of continuous conflicts in the 1960s and 1990s. Despite South Africa's enormous contribution as a peacemaker in the region since 1996, the situation in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains fragile. How can another potentially deadly conflict in the Great Lakes region be prevented in the future? And how can South Africa improve its performance as a peacemaker? This dissertation analyses South Africa's peace-making efforts in the context of three events in the Great Lakes region: the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the First Congo War in 1996, and the Second Congo War in 1998. The dissertation takes an empirical approach and focuses on eastern DRC, which has the highest concentration of causalities and is crucial to the wars of the DRC. In addition to literature and documents, I have also incorporated key informant interviews and my own personal observations during my assignment as a humanitarian worker from March 2007 to July 2008. These interviews and observations may shed light on the conflict from the perspective of Congolese people. I argue that South Africa has failed as a peacemaker due to four main factors: South Africa's inadequate knowledge of mediation skills; its ambivalent and contradictory foreign policy that stressed the country's interests; its insufficient understanding of major causes, aggravating factors and the nature of this regionalised conflict; and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)'s paradoxical politics. The aim of this dissertation is to explore possible solutions to conflict by strengthening South Africa's peace-making opportunities, which IS the key to implementing successful conflict prevention.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>There have been many national and provincial studies on children's literacy levels in recent years in South Africa. However, none has determined the teachers' own understandings of the core indicators of an effective reading teacher. During a preliminary feasibility study, the researcher was surprised to discover how many under-qualified teachers there were who had a limited professional understanding of current primary school reading instructions, approaches and practices. To assess more accurately these experienced teachers' perceived professional competencies in teaching reading, the current study reports the development, refinement, validation and implementation of a conveniently self-administered profile of professional competencies designated the &quot;Core Indicators of an Effective Reading Teacher Questionnaire&quot; (CIERTQ).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Selective removal of water from the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) during reaction may allow the use of a cobalt catalyst with crystal size &lt;6 nm hence increasing the catalyst activity. Zeolite membranes are a potential route to in-situ water removal due to their chemical and thermal stability under FTS reaction conditions. Zeolite membranes with a low Si/ Al ratio are hydrophilic. It has been hypothesised that reducing the Si/ Al ratio will result in increased water selectivity and permeance. It is also hypothesised that the separation process can be modelled using the MaxwellStefan (MS) formulation. MFI zeolite membranes were synthesised on a-alumina supports, of varying  Si/ Al ratio. Two synthesis techniques were used: viz. with and without the assistance of structure directing agents. The membrane physical properties were characterised by SEM and XRD. Membrane quality was evaluated using n-hexane porosimetry. Single gas and mixture separations were carried out. A trans-membrane pressure gradient was applied in single gas measurements. Binary and ternary mixture separations were carried out using a model reaction mixture that approximates FTS conditions. This mixture was fed to a Wicke-Kallenbach cell. The total pressure on both sides of the membrane was equal, with a sweep gas applied to remove the permeate. Single gas permeation measurements on a blank support shows that viscous and knudsen flow are the dominant transport mechanisms in the support. A single gas permeation model for the zeolite membranes show that viscous and knudsen flow still dominate in pure component measurements. This due to the high flux through the zeolite films. During mixture separations viscous and knudsen flow are negligible as there is no pressure gradient. Comparing pure component and binary mixture separations the flux of hydrogen decreases by more than two orders of magnitude for the binary case. In the binary system water adsorption results in blockage of pores hence hydrogen permeance is reduced. Binary H20/H2 separation selectivity increases with decreasing Si/ Al ratio. Increasing temperature results in a decrease in this selectivity. Water adsorption decreases with increasing temperature hence hydrogen can permeate faster. With the addition of n-hexane as a third component, permeance of water and hydrogen decrease, however ternary H20/H2 separation selectivity increases. The Maxwell-Stefan model developed does not predict binary hydrogen permeation well. Permeance is much higher than predicted by the model possibly due to defects. Ternary hydrogen permeance is however more accurately predicted. Water and n-hexane permeances are predicted well by the model.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Die tesis ondersoek die intertekstuele gesprek in Van Heerden se oeuvre met betrekking tot die temas van narratief, trauma en heling. Teoretiese uitgangspunte vanuit literere en sielkundige ondersoekterreine word gebruik. Ek fokus op narratief en trauma in Van Heerden se romans Matoli (1978), Toorberg (1986), Casspirs en Campari 's (1991), Die stoetmeester (1993), Kikoejoe (1996), Die sYrye van Mario Salviati (2000), In stede van die liefde (2005) en Asbesmiddag (2007). Verskillende fasette van die verwerking van trauma op individuele en kollektiewe vlak, wat regdeur Van Heerden se werk loop, word ondersoek. Daar word gekyk na die temas van verwonding en verskeurdheid en die moontlikheid van heling en versoening in Van Heerden se romans. Die verwerking en herskryf van die verlede, op individuele en kollektiewe vlak; kwessies rondom identiteit nadat 'n lewensnarratief deur trauma verwoes is; die soeke na 'n nuwe toekoms en versoening, versoening met die self, in die gesin en in die land word ondersoek in terme van narratief en trauma. Daar word gekyk na die temas van die verwerking van die verlede, die skuldgevoel van Suid-Afrikaners gedurende en na apartheid, en die verwonding van mense gedurende apartheid. Onderdrukte fasette van die geskiedenis kom na vore in Van Heerden se oeuvre, wat 'n stem gee aan diegene wat in die Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedskrywing gemarginaliseer is. Die soeke na identiteit mi 'n traumatiese belewenis en die (on-)moontlikheid van he ling is sentrale temas by Van Heerden. Daar word ondersoek ingestel na die intertekstuele 'gesprek' tussen Van Heerden se romans aangaande sentrale temas wat op mekaar bou in sy werk. Van Heerden se oeuvre bevestig die helende potensiaal van narratief deur die wyse waarop die temas van verwonding en heling, wat deurlopend in sy werk voorkom, uitgebeeld word.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Leveraging Whole Genome Sequences to Compare Mutational Mechanism and Identify Medically Relevant Variation in African versus Non-African Descend Populations</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) is ushering a new era in healthcare and research in identifying genetic variation in all populations. However, the African populations are still under-represented. Since African populations are being the most genetically diverse with high heterogeneity rate, we need to benchmark the Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) analysis pipeline to ensure reliable mutation detection. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all steps of WGS downstream analysis are accurate, mainly the variant calling (VC). Current VC tools may produce falsepositive/negative results; such result may produce misleading conclusions in prioritisation of mutation, clinical relevancy and actionability of genes. With such many VC tools, two questions have arisen. Firstly, which tool has a high rate of sensitivity and precision in low either high coverage African sequences, given they have high genetic diversity and heterogeneity? Secondly, does the improvement of the VC result will advance the accuracy of detecting mutation and incidental finding (actionable genes) in African populations? In this project, a total of 100 DNA sequence samples was simulated (of which every 50 samples mimicked the genetics background of African and European, respectively) at different coverage (high and low). In particular, the sensitivity to discover polymorphisms was done by nine different VC tools. These tools were assessed in term of false positive/negative call rate given the simulated golden variants. Combining our result on sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Lofreq performs best in African population data (sens=0.85, PPV=0.983, F-score=0.91) on high/low coverage data; as a result, we chose Lofreq to perform variant calling, and Gene-based annotation is performed to conduct in-sillico predication of mutation on publicly available data (the African Genome Variation and 1000 Genome Project). In doing so, we have leveraged WGS to examine and validate four of burden diseases in the African content, such as communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and Non-communicable diseases: such as Sickle cell disease, these diseases have uniquely shaped ethnic-specific and continental genomics variation and therefore provides unprecedented opportunities to map disease genes across the African continent. Moreover, the current actionable gene recommended by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) in the African population and update on additional African-specific actionable genes. Our result suggests African and African diaspora ethnic groups, particularly Bantu and Khoesan ethnics have gene diversity, high proportion of derived allele at low minor allele frequency (0.0 − 01) and the highest proportion of pathogenic variants within HIV, TB, Malaria, Sickle-Cell disease, while non-African ethnic groups including Latin America, Afro-Asiatic European related ethnic groups have high proportion of pathogenic variants within current actionable gene list. Overall, given the observed highest genetic diversity found in African ethnics and African diaspora related ethnics at these four Africa burden diseases and current actionable gene associated, our results support (1) the use of personalised medicine as beneficial to both African continent and worldwide; (2) a recommendation for African-specific actionable list of genes to further improve African and diaspora healthcare.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Racial discrimination in mental health treatment in South Africa was well established by the 1890's. This study shows this discrimination was perpetuated through to the 1930's and 1940's. By means of a thorough review of racial and psychiatric literature pertaining to the period, this dissertation provides a rich context in to which to place the psychiatric practice of Valkenberg Mental Hospital for the period 1933-1943. Archival research was used to investigate official hospital records of, and case records for, Valkenberg for the years 1933; 1936; 1939; 1942 and 1943. Content analysis was used to analyse the case records and identify any discrimination across diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, criminal activity of patients, deaths in patients, and readmittance. Invidual case histories were also analyzed to ascertain psychiatric practice at a more individual level. Results showed that racial discrimination was still prevalent in the psychiatric practice of Valkenberg for the period. In Valkenberg 'non-European' patients received poorer care, were given inferior therapeutic treatment and often denied access to various effective treatments. European patients on the other hand superior care and had access to all the new and effective physical methods of treatment. Non-European patients were also subject to the racist attitudes of doctors and nurses, which in turn affected the level of care they received. The records also reveal the psychiatrists of the period not only purported the racist doctrines, they were involved in theories and studies that helped justify and confirm them.

   <dc:description>There are several industrial-grade simulation tools, used for small-signal stability studies, that are commercially available on the market. However, these tools differ in their components modeling and solution methodology. Therefore, different simulation tools can give different results for the same power system model. In this thesis, five industrial-grde simulation tools - PSS/E, PowerFactory, EUROSTAG, SSAT, and MatNetEig - are investigated. The features and capabilities of the five tools are compared based on componenets modeling, numerical methodology, and tool flexibility in terms of data input and output.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has witnessed growing participation in the Games since its inception and has made strong efforts to collect comprehensive injury and illness data during the London 2012 Paralympics. Until now, no studies have comprehensively evaluated upper limb injuries at the Paralympic Games. To describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of upper limb injuries in athletes participating in the London 2012 Paralympic Games and identify the groups of athletes at risk. This study forms a component of the large prospective cohort study conducted over the 14-day period of the London 2012 Paralympic Games, coordinated through the IPC Medical Committee. Data were collected in two phases. Phase 1 involved the determination of the incidence and severity for 3,565 athletes (85% of the Paralympic athletes) from a collation of three data sources, providing 46,606 athlete days of data for analysis. Phase 2 involved the collection of more detailed medical data using a novel web-based surveillance system for 3,329 athletes participating in the study (80% of Paralympic athletes). Incidence proportion (IP) has been defined as the number of injuries per 100 athletes (%) during the study period. Incidence rate (IR) has been defined as the number of injuries per 1000 athlete days for the study period and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported in parentheses.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Microgrid planning and design under uncertainty: A case study in Northern Angola</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Kamanzi, Brian</dc:creator>

   <dc:description>The national energy development plan for Angola, Angola Energia 2025, identifies the need to balance efforts to expand access to electricity in countries with low levels of industrialisation, across the urban and rural spheres. This need is coupled with the urgency of investing in environmentally sustainable technologies responding to local and international targets addressing the impacts of Climate Change. This dissertation seeks to assess the feasibility of an electricity micro-grid system (a) for uplifting the quality of life and development of two neighboring Angolan coastal villages, and (b) one that (I) depends entirely on domestic renewable sources of electricity generation; (ii)has a sustainable initial generating capacity of not less than 2MW and (iii) is flexible enough to undergo future expansion as needed over time. The design of a proposed Microgrid solution for N'zeto and Tomboco villages located in Angola is developed through a thorough context study used in conjunction with remotely acquired contextual data and a variety of estimation and model techniques. Microgrids are defined as a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity functioning with two modes of operation. The Microgrid design process requires a set of context specific empirical data ranging from load profiles of the site under survey to the availability of endogenous energy resources. The existence of documented public policy, the domestic availability of renewable resources in and around the study area, the present low population density in rural Angola, the low level of Angola's rural electrification , and the existence of financing mechanisms which the country can afford. The load profile and contemplated electrical energy consumption in the study area along with an estimation of the availability, nature, diversity, and extent of the domestic renewable energy sources are developed as key inputs for design decisions related to component sizing. A comparative evaluation of their performance of two proposed candidate solutions, derived from the assessment of the available energy resources is used as a basis to select preferred candidate. The proposed solution is subjected a sensitivity analysis of key design variables. Aspects of the selected design, including concept of operations, reticulation and a discussion on the possible downstream benefits are elaborated in compliance with the technical and policy constraints of the proposed electrification scheme.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research explored the experiences of work-family conflict amongst a group of twenty single working mothers with pre-school age children. Dubin's (1992) theory of Central Life Interests was utilised to fully understand how the differential importance of the roles played by the women informed the level and nature of the conflict experienced. A two-phase research design was employed, in which questionnaire responses from the first phase formed the basis for the second phase of in-depth qualitative interviews. Results indicated that participants viewed motherhood as their Central Life Interest and that this priority could lead them to experience greater conflict between work and family demands. Although work was rated second in importance when compared to family, it was still seen as being of great significance, not only for instrumental reasons but also for the intellectual stimulation provided and opportunities for participants to exercise independence and resposibility.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Audit of transfusion practice during burns surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Spies, Anri</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Bester, Kotie</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>Anaesthesiology</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Rationale: Major burn surgery can be associated with significant blood loss, often requiring transfusion of blood products. In an effort to decrease aforementioned blood loss, various blood conservation strategies have been developed, rendering older formulae to predict intraoperative blood loss ineffective and outdated. Currently there are no clear guidelines on when to transfuse burn victims but, the trend is towards employing a more conservative transfusion practice in an attempt to reduce transfusion related complications. The predicament has become one of containing cost by not ordering blood unnecessarily and/or excessively, versus putting a patient at risk by not having blood available when he or she needs it. A guideline, based on haemoglobin and extent of surgery, was drawn up at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in an effort to rationalise preoperative blood ordering. The aim of this audit was to assess how well the implemented guideline was adhered to, and how accurately the guideline predicted the need to have blood products available in theatre during burns surgeries of varying extent. Methods: After a guideline, based on expert opinion, had been drawn up and implemented, a prospective audit of practice was done from April 2014 to June 2015. Two hundred separate burn surgeries were audited. Data collected included haemoglobin levels, extent of surgery, pre-and intra-operative instructions to blood bank, and whether patients were transfused. Pre-operative instructions were compared to the guideline to test adherence, and to the ultimate need for blood to test accuracy. Additional data recorded were the adherence to surgical plan (extent of surgery). Results: Five of the 200 cases were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 195 cases. Blood was ordered according to the guideline in 131 (67.2%) cases. There were two groups where adherence was particularly poor. In these patients the guideline suggested that only a group and screen was necessary - a category for which it would also be difficult to assess how accurately the guideline predicts the need for blood. After excluding these two groups, the preoperative instructions to the blood bank were appropriate in 119 (94.4%) of the 126 cases where the guideline was followed. Blood was ordered preoperatively in 83 of the 195 cases, but only used in 50 cases (60.2%). Of the 33 cases where blood was not used, 23 cases were not in keeping with the guideline. In 50 (83%) of the 60 cases where blood was ordered according to the guideline, it was appropriate. The performed surgery proceeded as planned in 162 (83.1%) cases. Discussion: Blood transfusion exposes the recipient to transfusion-related risks and is expensive. In an attempt to avoid these risks there has been a trend towards conservative transfusion practices. It has been shown to be cost effective and safe to employ a restrictive transfusion practice during major paediatric burn surgery. During our study period one unit of blood cost R1096,00 and a group and screen R172,00. Significant savings could therefore be incurred if blood is ordered according to the proposed guideline. Conclusion: This audit confirmed that the guideline is an appropriate one to use for preoperative ordering of blood products for burns surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Affected members of the family investigated in this dissertation presented with photosensitivity and raised red cell protoporphyrin concentrations, indicative of protoporphyria. Further examination of this family revealed features that were atypical of erythropoietic protoporphyria. These included a highly penetrant disease, disease severity as expressed by more prevalent hepatic complications, a preponderance of protoporphyrin in its zinc chelated form, a therapeutic response to iron supplementation, and an absence of mutations in the ferrochelatase gene or haplotype markers associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria. We have reviewed clinical data from this family, established a ferrochelatase enzyme assay in our laboratory, and shown normal ferrochelatase enzyme activity in affected subjects.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This essay is a wholly theoretical engagement with the pedagogic relation. It attempts to take a small step in the direction of theorising the very complex phenomenon of the pedagogic relation. The relation is non-trivial as it is imbued with all the complications of social relations, plus the added complexity of the relation of knowledge in the social/libidinal economy of the classroom.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>We consider a mechanistic non-linear machine learning approach to learning signals in financial time series data. A modularised and decoupled algorithm framework is established and is proven on daily sampled closing time-series data for JSE equity markets. The input patterns are based on input data vectors of data windows preprocessed into a sequence of daily, weekly and monthly or quarterly sampled feature measurement changes (log feature fluctuations). The data processing is split into a batch processed step where features are learnt using a Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) via unsupervised learning, and then both batch and online supervised learning are carried out on Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) using these features. The FNN output is a point prediction of measured time-series feature fluctuations (log differenced data) in the future (ex-post). Weight initializations for these networks are implemented with restricted Boltzmann machine pretraining, and variance based initializations. The validity of the FNN backtest results are shown under a rigorous assessment of backtest overfitting using both Combinatorially Symmetrical Cross Validation and Probabilistic and Deflated Sharpe Ratios. Results are further used to develop a view on the phenomenology of financial markets and the value of complex historical data under unstable dynamics.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>We have problem areas which are beyond the scope of a discipline, but we are generally educated in just a single discipline. I explored our philosophy of work to see how we became disciplinary, where the disciplines came from, what philosophy underlies our way of working, and what philosophy underpins work that is beyond the scope of a discipline. The underlying philosophy leads to the research question. My hypothesis is that a systems engineer can create a model which networks the disciplines using constructs from philosophy, the tiers of disciplines in transdisciplinarity, and systemic and holistic thinking. This will provide a way of working on problem situations which transgress the boundary of a discipline. Using constructs from philosophy, the methods of the philosophers, hermeneutics, systems thinking and soft systems methodology I proceeded to create a conceptual model and showed conceptual examples of how to use the model. The client for the model is the interdisciplinary researcher who is seeking a way of working to manage problem areas that transgress disciplinary boundaries. The recommendation is made for using critical, systemic and holistic thinking and a network model of disciplines to manage our approach to problem situations which are beyond the scope of a discipline. The model is developed in the incremental sequence: disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and gets as far as catering for tiers of disciplines (one aspect of the large and complex field of transdisciplinarity). Therefore, the model is suitable for interdisciplinary research, but can be developed further in future projects. The importance of the model is that it provides a practical way of working to manage problem situations which transgress disciplinary boundaries whilst accessing the expertise of disciplined practitioners. The model can find wide applicability. It is not necessary for the user of the model to be comfortable with the abstract philosophy used to create it. Users will need the will for uncoerced mutual understanding or free communication, along with their disciplinary expertise. The reader of the dissertation however should be comfortable with abstractions such as ideas about reality and actuality, form and class, subject and object, truth and justice, truthfulness and functional fit. Future work may reduce the method to practice in the academy and extend the method to bridging silos in learning organisations in the workplace. The work was conducted independently, and an original model was created.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The unique knowledge that teachers possess Shulman called pedagogical content knowledge or PCK. In the following 25 years many scholars have conceptualised PCK, and only recently, with an international PCK Summit, have attempts been made to consolidate this field. South Africa’s primary and secondary public education system is continuously under scrutiny, as it continues to perform poorly in international benchmarking assessments. The need to understand what is happening in our classrooms, especially in science and mathematics, is now more important than ever. In response to this need, this study investigated the classroom practice of a dedicated and experienced science teacher over a period of three years, as she taught the organic chemistry section of the Grade 12 Physical Sciences syllabus. PCK was used as a lens to focus on how teacher knowledge manifests in practice.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Chemical defence in the red-billed wood hoopoe : phoeniculus purpureus</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Law-Brown, Janette</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Du Plessis, Morné</dc:contributor>
   <dc:description>Red-billed Woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, produce a pungent smelling secretion from their uropygial gland. Previous researchers have noted this odour and there has been much speculation on its function. This encouraged me to undertake this study to determine the origin of the odour and the role that the secretion plays. The chemical analysis of this secretion shows that it consists of 17 compounds including acids, aldehydes, lactones and other miscellaneous compounds. Cultures of the secretion showed the presence of a symbiotic bacterium resident within the gland. Antibiotic treatment of the gland suggested that this bacterium was instrumental in the synthesis of the secretion of P. purpureus. This bacterium has not previously been identified and has been proposed as 'Enterococcus phoeniculicola' (GenBank accession number: AYO28437). The secretion was synthesized and the responses of a range of 13 pathogenic and one parasitic bacteria were tested against it and its individual constituent compounds. The synthetic secretion and seven of its constituent compounds inhibited the growth of these bacteria. However, exposing feather mites resident upon the birds to the synthetic secretion did not illicit any significant response from these mites. Wanless (1998) showed that the synthetic secretion causes an averse reaction in cats. In this study I was able to identify indole, phenol and propionaldehyde as being responsible for eliciting this reaction in cats. A similar averse reaction is shown by Rock Monitor Lizards, Varanus albigularis, upon encountering mice tainted with the synthetic secretion. This is the first demonstration of a symbiotic relationship between birds and bacteria in which the modification of the birds' uropygial oils affords the birds some protection against pathogens and preators.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use disorder in individuals with severe mental disorders (SMDs) has significant impact on clinical presentation and care. Although treatments exist, these are met by significant challenges. Notably, brief treatments for MA use within the general population have been feasible, acceptable and effective. An individualized, integrated treatment for MA use within a psychiatric inpatient setting would allow adjustment of the treatment according to individual patient needs. It is important to understand the patient needs and potential service barriers to care before formulating a treatment. This study begins to address this gap by seeking to understand the views of healthcare providers on a brief treatment to address MA use among patients with a dual diagnosis. METHODS: Thirteen key stakeholders working with patients with mental disorders including severe mental disorders and co morbid MA use were interviewed using an open-ended semi- structured interview schedule designed to explore their views on a brief treatment for MA use among patients with a dual diagnosis. Interviews were transcribed and the framework approach was used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Numerous themes emerged from the data. First, there are multiple risk factors for MA use. Second, this use has a significant impact on multiple aspects of patient presentation and care including individual impacts, family impacts, and impact on care. Third, although treatments for MA use disorders exist, these have significant challenges at multiple levels. Lastly, the integration of a modified brief treatment for MA use in patients with dual diagnosis would be possible if it was adjusted to patient-specific needs within the existing system and if the team adapting the treatment were cognizant of existing and potential challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation and integration of a brief treatment for MA use among patients with severe mental disorders was considered possible and even necessary if existing and potential challenges were carefully addressed.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Introduction: Induction of labour is commonly performed in clinical practice. Increasing rates of induction of labour worldwide has led to debate on whether elective induction improves the outcomes or simply leads to increased complications and healthcare costs. Maternal and neonatal complications and increased caesarean section (CS) rates associated with induction of labour are related to a variety of factors influencing the methods of induction. Misoprostol has been the drug of choice for induction of labour in developing countries for almost a decade. Different misoprostol regimens are used for induction of labour in different health facilities. New Somerset Hospital uses the standard protocol for induction of labour using misoprostol that the Western Cape Government adopted. This protocol has however not been audited. The main objective of the study was to determine the maternal and fetal outcomes of inductions of labour performed at New Somerset Hospital. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted at New Somerset Hospital. We reviewed a random sample of medical records of patients who underwent induction of labour from 01 January 2014 to 31 December 2014. Ethics committee approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of UCT. A total of 88 folders were sampled from 1029 women who had induction of labour. Results: There were a total of 6514 deliveries in 2014 of which 1029 had induction of labour, giving an induction rate of 15.8%. A total of 86 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 28.9 years (SD±6.586) with an age range of 16 to 44 years. The average gestational age at the time of induction of labour was 39.5 weeks with a range 35 to 42.6 weeks and 14.0% of the patients were HIV positive. The three main indications of induction of labour were hypertension in pregnancy (40.7%), prolonged pregnancy (27.9%) and pre-labour rupture of membranes (8.1%). Overall, 50 patients (58.1%) had vaginal delivery and 36 patients (41.9%) had caesarean delivery. There was a significant association between mode of delivery and time to delivery. Patients who delivered within 24 hours of commencement of induction of labour were more likely to have had a vaginal delivery (p = 0.005). The three main indications for caesarean delivery were fetal heart rate changes (n=30; 72.0%) followed by failed induction of labour (n=9; 21.0%) and cephalopelvic disproportion (n=3; 7.0 %). In terms of maternal outcomes, 2 patients (2.3%) had hyperstimulation of the uterus, 6 patients (7.0%) had postpartum hemorrhage, 8 patients (9.3%) had vaginal tears and 5 patients (5.9%) had an episiotomy performed during delivery. The mean birth weight was 3262.1g (SD±503.77) with a range of 1925 to 4515 grams. At five minutes the means Apgar score was 9.8(SD ± 0.62) with range of 6 to 10. A total of 38 babies (44.3%) had meconium stained liquor documented at delivery, three babies (3.4%) required neonatal resuscitation upon delivery. There were 10 (11.6%) babies that were admitted to NICU. Conclusion: In this study we found that the prevalence of induction of labour was 15.8%. Hypertension in pregnancy, prolonged pregnancy and pre-labour rupture of membranes are the three common indications for induction of labour. Successful vaginal delivery was achieved in 51.0% of the study population. The caesarean delivery rate was high, mostly due to CTG changes The current induction of labour protocol using oral misoprostol is associated with acceptable maternal and fetal outcomes.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Resurrection plants, including Myrothamnus flabellifolius, grow in shallow soil upon rocky outcrops where they experience regular periods of water stress. Associated with this is light stress. The presence of light under water limiting conditions can result in photo-oxidation which causes damage to plant tissues. M flabellifolius is a homoichlorophyllous plant and thus retains chlorophyll during desiccation. The mechanisms whereby this plant prevents photo-oxidation damage are not known and thus one of the objectives of this study was to characterise the chloroplasts and the changes they undergo during dehydration. It was shown that chloroplasts from M flabellifolius could only be isolated using trehalose gradients (instead of sucrose gradients) and were found to have a higher buoyant density than chloroplasts isolated from another resurrection plant, Craterostigma wilmsii. The latter had the same buoyant density as those isolated from the desiccation sensitive plant Pisum sativum. The increased buoyant density in M flabellifolius was ascribed to the unusual ultrastructure of the thylakoid membranes. The latter have a staggered conformation (staircase arrangement) rather than the discrete granal and intergranal conformation found in most plants.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>COLAB: social context and user experience in collaborative multiplayer games</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Computer Science</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that the social context in which people play digital multiplayer games has an effect on their experience. Whether co-players are in the same location (&quot;co-located&quot;) or in different locations (&quot;mediated&quot;) changes how they interact with the game and with one another. We set out to explore how these complex psychological dynamics played out in a collaborative multiplayer game, since most of the research to date has been focused on competitive gameplay scenarios. To this end, we designed a two-player puzzle-based gaming apparatus called COLAB, implementing specific features that have been proven to foster collaboration and preclude competition between players. The independent variable was player location; the dependent variable was game experience, as measured by the Social Presence in Gaming Questionnaire and the Game Experience Questionnaire, two comprehensive self-report instruments. We found a significant difference in the game experiences of players collaborating in the same location versus players collaborating in different locations. Specifically, co-located players of the collaborative game experienced significantly higher scores for negative experience than mediated players did, while mediated players experienced significantly higher levels of three key game-experience measures: positive affect, immersion, and flow.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The purpose of this study is to examine if personal values/value systems held by employees can be used to accurately assign them to levels of work to which they will be best suited and, by implication, are likely to perform well. To fulfil this purpose, data covering a biographically mixed sample (N=399), being employees of various organisations was obtained by way of psychological assessment. Two psychological measures were used - one that measures employees' level of work profiles (CPP) and the other, their personal value systems (VO). Using correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis, the study finds a statistically significant association between an employee's value system and his/her level of work profile (p&lt;.05), and a moderate but also statistically significant ability of values to predict an employee's level of work profile (p&lt;.001). The study concludes by recommending that, as part of the many considerations that should be taken into account in pursuit of successful initial and subsequent placement of people in organisations, personal values held by employees should be one of the qualities to be assessed and taken into consideration. The study further notes that the consideration of employee value systems as a quality necessary for on-the-job success should be done in addition to, rather than in replacement of the traditionally preferred qualities of cognitive abilities, personality and acquired knowledge/skills.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Breast cancer is well-known globally and remains one of the principal health concerns affecting women, and a rare malignancy in men. Although, there has been significant progress made in prevention strategies such as early detection and better treatment in most developed countries, incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer continued to rise. The rise is significant in Africa, a continent low in resources with a growing and ageing population exposed to risk factors leading to developing the disease. Although the incidence of breast cancer is lower in Africa than in high-income countries, mortality rates are high, mainly in women less than fifty years of age. Like most African countries, Libya is least prepared to cope with breast cancer and cancer in general. Additionally, many Libyans are adopting unhealthy lifestyles together which, together with environmental changes and high life expectancy, is perhaps the cause of rising cancer rates. However, no systematic collection of breast cancer incidence is currently undertaken, which in turn, impacts the implementation of detection and treatment measures. This thesis sought to evaluate the situation of breast cancer in Africa and specifically, for Libyan patients, through a systematic review of prevalence studies in Africa and by designing a registry for Libyan breast cancer patients. Objectives : • To conduct a systematic review and literature-based meta-analysis to provide an evidence-based estimate of the prevalence rate of breast cancer in Africa. This systematic review provides epidemiological data to guide health practitioners, educators and researchers for further studies needed in the field of breast cancer, specific for African patients. • To design a breast cancer registry for Libyan breast cancer patients. Developing a Libyan breast cancer registry provides an opportunity to learn more about disease development, and the changes through the course of the patient's life. Secondly, we will be able to track the incidence, mortality, and survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer and their distribution in Libya. Finally, the information will be translated into numbers to aid policymakers in measuring the extent of the problem and help researchers in taking action needed to reduce the breast cancer load in Libya. Methods: • A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies retrieved from electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists, with no time and language limits. We have reviewed the available studies addressing the prevalence rate of breast cancer for African patients living in Africa who developed the disease. • Secondly, the Libyan Breast Cancer Registry (LBCR) is a prospective, hospital-based registry planned to document clinical and imaging characteristics of patients at presentation. Through follow-up, we will document disease progression and treatment practices to reliably determine the incidence of all-cause mortality and worsening disease requiring hospitalization. Results: • The overall prevalence rate of breast cancer in Africa was 0.30 [ 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.34] (22 studies, n=10,795). The prevalence rate of breast cancer for African females was 0.49 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.62]. South African region had the highest breast cancer prevalence rate, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.24 to 1.26], while the lowest rates of breast cancer were from Central African regions. The use of mammography yielded higher rates of detection, (0.63 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82]), in comparison with clinical breast examination (0.31 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42]). • The proposed LBCR comprises parts I, II, AND III. Part I consists of demographic data and cancer information detailing personal data such as medical history, general examination, breast examination, methods and results of the diagnosis, and the treatment offered. Part II comprises the forms used for continuous follow-up – a new form is completed at each visit. All new information regarding patients' details, new complaints, and investigation findings and any changes or treatment offered at the visit, are recorded in this section. Part III documents mortality information. Details are recorded accompanied with a copy of the death certificate, and an autopsy report in case it was required. The LBCR pack includes consent forms in both English and Arabic languages. Also, it is accompanied by a manual of operation with given answered examples. Furthermore, the form is provided with contact details in case of any required information or explanation needed in the future. Conclusion: The clinical picture of breast cancer in Africa differs from Western countries due to the high proportion of patients developing the disease at a younger age and seeking management care at an advanced stage. Currently, there exists no specific breast cancer registry designed specifically for any African patients living in Africa. The LBCR will provide comprehensive, contemporary data on patients with breast cancer through establishing a baseline figure of the current situation for future local and national comparisons. The LBCR includes ready and accessible information for the temporary and future use of medical elements and researchers in this field and will help in the development of strategies to prevent and manage breast cancer and its complications.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The main purpose of this dissertation was to create a series of short stories based on a feminine point of view. STOORNIS, a collection of eighteen widely diverse stories, concentrates on making women the focal point in a diverse discourse and thematic register. The emphasis is placed on the role of esotericism (compare NAKENNIS and DIE BESOEKER), the influence of modern technology and computers (DIE MEESTER and STAATSGREEP), the juxtaposition of criminal modus operandi and the creative muses (BLOEDGELD and DIE SMOKKELROETE), the role of women in a military environment (MYNVELD and DIE GENERAAL EN DIE SIENER) as well as the occurrence of psychological aberration in women (LeERS and STOORNIS). Many facets of women's sexual identity, such as abortion (DIE SLAGDING) and lesbianism (WAG OP DIE KONINGIN), are scrutinized. No formal distinction was made between theory and criticism in the feminist discussion of STOORNIS. Theory and criticism were mutually regenerated and applied in the individual texts. Based on an assumption, the main point of feminism centres around the destruction of the phallus: through decontruction, men in the texts are &quot;unmasked&quot; on many levels. Theoretical feminist terms, such as stereotyping, prejudice, patriarchalism, sexism, chauvinism, phallocentrism and androcentrism were used to execute the &quot;unmasking&quot; process. · Through the use of metaphoric destruction of the phallus it was attempted to deconstruct the authorative manipulation of men (which women are succumb to) and to strive towards a reconciliation process between man and woman, in other words, the androgynous ideal of feminism.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be the cause of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers as well as genital and common warts. There are currently three prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines. These vaccines, however, do not offer protection against all HPV strains and cannot act therapeutically and so further vaccine development is still needed. The burden of HPV is also highest in low-income countries for which the vaccine costs are still quite high, and therefore alternative methods of vaccine production and testing are needed. HPV pseudovirions (PsVs) are synthetic viral particles that are made up of the L1 major and L2 minor HPV capsid proteins and encapsidate up to 8Kb of pseudogenome DNA without the need of an encapsidation signal. HPV PsVs are used to test neutralising antibodies elicited by vaccines, for studying the virus life cycle, and potentially for delivery of therapeutic DNA vaccines. HPV PsVs are typically produced in mammalian cells; however, it has recently been shown that HPV PsVs can be produced in plants, a potentially safer, cheaper and more easily scalable means of production. While, a current problem with plant HPV PsV production is low yields, research has shown that using pseudogenome DNAs between 5-7Kb increases yields of papillomavirus PsVs in mammalian cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the optimal pseudogenome size for encapsidation by plant produced PsVs, in order to increase the amount of PsVs in a sample as opposed to VLPs. Pseudogenome constructs encoding Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP )and ranging in size from 4.8Kb – 7.8kb were cloned into a geminivirus-derived replicating vector, transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and then infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana along with plant expression vectors encoding the HPV 35 L1 and L2 capsid proteins. Particles were purified by iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation and the 27% and 33% fractions of this gradient analysed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm particle assembly and L1 expression was quantified by ELISA. Particles were disrupted with proteinase K and quantitative PCR was used to quantify the encapsidated DNA. Ratios of encapsidated DNA to L1 capsid protein were calculated for each of the PsV samples with different sized pseudogenomes, to account for batch-to-batch variation and as an approximation of which size pseudogenome is better encapsidated. Infective ability of the particles was analysed by incubating the PsVs onto HEK293TT cells and then checking for DNA delivery and protein expression by measuring EGFP expression by Western blots. The results showed that PsVs are found predominantly in the 27% fraction of the iodixanol gradient whereas the 33% fraction of the gradient appears to only contain VLPs. The data also indicated that the smaller pseudogenomes, were packaged more efficiently into PsVs as higher concentrations of encapsidated DNA and higher levels of EGFP expression were obtained when the 4.8Kb pseudogenome was used, compared to when the larger 5.8 - 7.8Kb pseudogenomes were used. Thus, the results showed that smaller pseudogenomes, around 4.8Kb, should be used for the plant production of HPV 35 PsVs as they are better packaged than larger pseudogenomes and thereby produce higher yields of functional PsVs.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis proposes to solve the aforementioned problems by applying XML and companion standards in the design and implementation of a PBNM system, placing focus on QoS management. XML has powerful modelling capabilities and allows the design of data models of arbitrary complexity, as opposed to the data description language of COPS-PR which is limited in flexibility. XML-based protocols are textbased and therefore human readable.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Silozi, a mixed language: an analysis of the noun class system and kinship terms</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Mbeha, Gustav Nyambe</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Brenzinger, Matthias</dc:contributor>

   <dc:description>Silozi, the language of the Malozi people in Zambia and Namibia is a mixed language that has been the subject of a classification debate between scholars. Doke (1943) classifies Silozi in the same zone as Sesotho languages due to linguistic similarities. Guthrie (1948) in contrast, classify it independently because of its geographic location. Therefore, this study analyses and describes the mixed character of Silozi with focus on two areas. Firstly, the noun class system of Silozi is compared to those of Sesotho and the neighbouring languages to identify the origins of Silozi's noun classes. Secondly, present-day Silozi kinship terms are compared to Sesotho terms to determine which kinship terms are borrowed from Sesotho and which are not. The Silozi terms collected by early scholars are also compared with the presentday terms to identify differences. First hand language data was collected in the Kavuyu village (Zambia) and the Mahohoma settlement (Namibia) by employing a mixed methods approach. This involved the use of tailormade questionnaires which included open-ended questions and a wordlist. Furthermore, participant observations and open interviews were conducted. Twelve participants between the ages of 15 and 56 completed the questionnaire. Additionally, one family from each of the research sites was observed and for natural language data. The data used for comparative analysis was drawn primarily from Stirke and Thomas (1916) and Jalla (1936). Sesotho and Setswana native speakers were consulted for translations into the respective languages. The data analysis led to the following conclusions. Sesotho, Siluyana and some of the neighbouring languages contributed to Silozi significantly. The noun classes 1-10, 14 and 15 of Silozi are shared with Sesotho but the use has been modified due to contact with Siluyana. The diminutive classes 12-13 and locative classes 16-18 which have been lost in Sesotho were reinvented in Silozi through borrowing from Setswana and Siluyana. Most of Silozi's kinship terms from Sesotho have retained their semantic meanings but some have undergone semantic expansion. The kinship terms of non-Sesotho origin were borrowed from Siluyana and Simbunda. Though Silozi has more noun classes than its parent languages, it contains fewer kinship terms. The aim of this study is to illustrate the mixed character of Silozi in the noun class system and the kinship term, thus aiding the better understanding of Silozi.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation asks the research question: &quot;How does the Johannesburg Human Development Strategy conceptualise the constraints that exist to escaping poverty?&quot; It answers the question by adopting a critical approach to the Johannesburg Human Development Strategy (JHDS). Using an argument analysis methodology, the dissertation ascertains what assumptions about constraints to poverty reduction are implicit within the strategy. The dissertation shows the JHDS to emphasise livelihood asset deficiencies as the most significant constraint to poverty reduction.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Exploring how Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) is experienced among patients living with HIV associated TB in Khayelitsha, South Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a construct that has received attention in research for nearly four decades. However, renewed interest in this field came about with advances in medical technology and health policies. Better treatment options and policies, which enables greater access to health care, have improved health outcomes, such as leading to an extension in life expectancy. This rings particularly true for Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and associated illnesses such Tuberculosis (TB). However, improvements in health outcomes are not necessarily accompanied by satisfactory patient experiences of HRQOL. Health-related quality of life is predominantly studied through quantitative research methodologies. However, the measures used are not entirely tailored to the South African context. Consequently, this mini-dissertation aims to explore HRQOL using qualitative methodological inquiry within the South African context. This mini dissertation is structured around the three following components: A research protocol (Part A) which addresses HRQOL in a South African context with particular focus on HIV and TB. Part B is a literature review examining existing HIV, TB and HRQOL literature, with emphasis on the South African context. The final section (Part C) is a manuscript for a journal article prepared to be published. Part C focuses on the social experience of HRQOL and how it is the central construct to experiencing HRQOL in South Africa as opposed to an individualised view in Western settings. The findings from this mini dissertation can add to the limited existing HRQOL literature in South Africa, by providing a perspective on how HRQOL is experienced in this country. The knowledge obtained here can further aid in the development or improvement of interventions and policies which aim to not only improve patient health outcomes, but HRQOL as well. Lastly, it can provide valuable information to those focused on developing quantitative HRQOL tools that are appropriate for use in South Africa.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Economic costs, impacts and financing strategies for mental health in South Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Over the past decade, calls to address the increasing burden of mental, neurological and substance-use (MNS) disorders and to include mental health care as an essential component of universal health coverage (UHC) have attracted mounting interest from governments. With the inclusion of mental health in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) there is now a global policy commitment to invest in mental health as a health, humanitarian and development priority. Low and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa, contemplating mental health system scale-up embedded into wider SDG- and UHC-related health-sector transformations, must address a number of key mental health financing policy considerations for attaining population-based improvements in mental health. Despite ongoing transformations in the South African health sector, there has been an implicit neglect of the integration of mental health services into general health service development. This has been driven in part by a lack of locally-derived evidence in several areas, including: the economic basis for investing in mental health, the current resourcing of the mental health system, opportunities for improved efficiency and equity, and how reforms may be structured and paid for in light of the country's ongoing efforts to implement a National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme. This thesis therefore attempts to address these gaps and aims to generate new knowledge on the economic costs, impacts and financing strategies for mental health in South Africa. This aim is achieved by fulfilling the following research objectives: 1. To examine the impact of social, national and community-based health insurance on health care utilization for MNS disorders in low- and middle-income countries. 2. To examine the policy context, strategic needs, barriers and opportunities for sustainable financing for mental health in South Africa. 3. To quantify public health system expenditure on mental health services, by service level and province, and to document and evaluate the resources and constraints of the mental health system in South Africa. 4. To examine the household economic costs and levels of financial risk protection associated with depression symptoms in South Africa. In the first part, the systematic review reports on the impact of social, national and community based health insurance on health care utilization for MNS disorders in LMICs, published until October 2018. As a secondary goal, the systematic review identifies whether there are any specific lessons that can be learnt from existing approaches to integrate mental health care into financing reforms towards universal health coverage. In the second part, a qualitative examination of the policy context, strategic needs, barriers and opportunities for sustainable financing for mental health in South Africa was conducted through a situational analysis that was complimented with a synthesis of key stakeholder consultations. The findings provide recommendations for how scaled-up mental health services can best be paid for in a way that is feasible, fair and appropriate within the fiscal constraints and structures of the country. In the third part, the thesis then empirically quantified public health system expenditure on mental health services, by service-level and province for the 2016/17 financial year, and documented and evaluated the resources and constraints of existing mental health investments in South Africa through a national survey; achieving one of the highest sample sizes of any costing study conducted for mental health in LMICs. In the fourth and final part, a household survey study was conducted to determine the level of financial protection for persons living with depression symptoms in the Dr. Kenneth Kaunda health district of South Africa, which is serving as a pilot site for the NHI. The household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum are reported; and demonstrate that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The thesis concludes by synthesizing findings towards an improved understanding of the key lessons that can be learned from other LMICs toward sustainable financing for mental health; the economic burden of inadequate mental health care to households in South Africa; and the efficiency of existing mental health investments and inequities in resourcing and access. Through this lens, and borrowing from the experiences of other LMICs, recommendations for key priorities for health service and financing reforms towards the scaled-up delivery of mental health services in South Africa are generated. The thesis is presented as papers embedded in a narrative that includes an introduction and synthesis discussion. Four papers (3 published and 1 under review) form the basis of the results chapters.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The rapid spread of digital information and communication technologies since the turn of the century has led to renewed debates about globalisation and the power of new media to connect users across national, political and cultural borders. Environmental campaigns like WWF's Earth Hour, which touts itself as “the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment,” often adopt a utopian view of globalisation that celebrates what Marshall McLuhan termed the ‘global village'. While this global ethos might be useful in engaging the publics in collective action, this article argues that the way Earth Hour and similar campaigns actively construct representations of a single global village overlooks the lived inequalities between and among peoples within this imagined community. This article explores this tension using a quantitative and qualitative mixed-methods approach that combines a semiotic analysis of the Earth Hour 2019 promotional video, social media analysis of the use of #Connect2Earth hashtag among South African Twitter users, and in-depth interviews with current and former WWF-South Africa employees. This strategic approach is designed to juxtapose socially constructed representations of Earth Hour with on-the-ground user engagement in South Africa, and then triangulating these findings with qualitative interviews. The dissertation aims to explore the research question: In what ways does WWF's Earth Hour embody Marshall McLuhan's ideal ‘global village' and in what ways might it engender a form of eco-imperialism? This research question is operationalised through three subquestions: What kind of environmentalism do global environmental campaigns like Earth Hour promote? How do audiences in South Africa engage with Earth Hour on social media? How do local WWF of ices adapt global environmental campaigns to suit local audiences? This research contributes to emerging scholarship, rooted in environmental justice and decolonial studies, that is critical of mainstream environmental movements not to discourage environmental consciousness but to ultimately reformulate it.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Post-operative analgesia currently relies on multimodal therapy including epidural analgesia, intravenous morphine and/or paracetamol (Perfalgan Â®) infusion. Local wound infusion has been effectively utilized in adults with promising results but has not been prospectively tested in children undergoing different abdominal operations. The aim of this study was to compare continuous local anesthetic wound infusion to the current standard of care in post-operative pain control in children. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized, pain assessor blinded trial comparing Bupivacaine wound infusion {Continuous Local Anaesthetic Wound Infusion - CLAWI) in addition to intravenous paracetamol (PerfalganÂ®) and morphine for rescue analgesia. This was compared to: (a) epidural bupivacaine plus intravenous morphine and PerfalganÂ®  [EPI] for children undergoing open abdominal surgery and (b) intravenous morphine and PerfalganÂ®  infusion alone [standard post-operative analgesia - SAPA] in children undergoing Lanz incision laparotomy for complicated appendicitis. Patients aged between 3 months and 12 years undergoing laparotomy or open appendectomy were randomly selected for local anesthetic wound infusion (CLAWI) versus EPI or CLAWI versus (SAPA) respectively. Exclusion criteria were neurological impairment, post-operative ventilation and history of adverse reaction to bupivacaine. Consent from the guardian, assent from patients above the age of 7 years and ethics approval from the University of Cape Town Human Ethics Research Committee was obtained. The wound infusion catheter ('lnfiltralLong', PANJUNKÂ®) was placed sub-fascially after suture of the peritoneum and 0.2 % bupivacaine 2mls/kg infused on anesthetic reversal followed by 0.2ml/kg/hour thereafter for 48 hours. Pain assessments were performed for each patient at regular intervals by a single assessor who had training in pediatric pain management and who was blinded to the group allocation. The duration of surgery, length of incision, perioperative antibiotics, wound class risk of surgical site infection, time to return to full feeds, drug reactions; hospital stay, surgical site infection and wound catheter and epidural catheter complications were recorded for each patient. Primary outcome measure was total morphine used in the appendectomy-SAPA vs appendectomy-CLAW! group and rescue morphine requirements in the laparotomy-EPI vs laparotomy-CLAWI group. The secondary outcomes were pain control as measured using the FLACC scale, time to full feeds, mobilization and requirement for urinary catheter.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research adopts a case study approach to investigate disputes involving municipal boundaries in rural communities under traditional authority. Further, a multiple case study approach is used to expose in-depth understanding of these disputes. The causes of the disputes are investigated and the processes of municipal demarcation and boundary dispute resolution are analysed against a number of frameworks such as the goals of good governance in land administration, management paradigm, rights, restrictions and responsibilities, Kotter's eight stages of change management, and 7Es performance measurement frameworks. From this critique, conclusions are drawn about the municipal demarcation processes and improvements are recommended. The study finds that the frameworks and tools applied are suitable for the analysis and evaluation of the municipal boundary demarcation process. The main findings indicate that several municipal demarcations negatively affected service delivery and threatened the role of traditional leaders.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This thesis is concerned with developing understanding of the issue of partnership sustainability and the factors that enable this. The South African further education and training (FET) college sector forms the context for the research and the specific focus is on entrepreneur development partnerships that have a community development focus. Numerous factors were found to strongly influence the sustainability of these kinds of partnerships. Of these factors, institutional 'will' was found to drive the establishment and continuation of partnerships, and the strength of this was largely determined by the relevance of a partnership to the strategy of an organisation, and the degree to which it delivered outcomes and benefits that matched expectations and were considered mutual. 'Will' on its own was found to be insufficient though as institutions also need the 'means' to put partnerships into practice and keep them going. 'Means' is understood as constituting a vision and strategy for the partnership, resources in the form of people, to lead it and carry out its work, and funding to finance its activities. Furthermore, for a partnership to be effective and continue over time it needs to be evolutionary and to go through cycles of implementation, reflection, learning and renewal. Good leadership, management and communication play a central role in this process. Additionally, healthy relationships are at the heart of effective long-term partnerships and, as such, a focus is needed on developing and maintaining the 'relationship' element of partnerships if these are to continue over time. Finally, the sustainability of partnerships is facilitated by formalised agreements, and their continuation beyond the individuals that established them is ensured through institutionalisation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation evaluates the hypothesis that the implementation of stringent firearm control in South Africa will significantly decrease levels of violent crime. First, the specific dynamics of violent crime in this country are examined, in order to establish whether firearm control constitutes a fitting response to the problem. Second, some of the important theoretical underpinnings of the firearms control debate are considered.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Fatigue Behaviour of CFRP Strengthened Reinforced Concrete Beams</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>James, Valontino Ruwhellon</dc:creator>

   <dc:subject>Structural Engineering</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The performance of reinforced concrete (RC) structures, such as bridges in the heavy haul industry, may be severely impacted by fatigue when subjected to repeated cyclic loading. Fatigue not only reduces load carrying capacity and serviceability limit states (SLS), but it can cause structural failure even when the components are subjected to low stress range cyclic loading. Corrosion damage exacerbates fatigue related problems as chloride induced pitting corrosion facilitates the formation and gradual propagation of cracks under cyclic loading. A common rehabilitation and retrofitting approach that involves patch repairing and fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening has proven effective to not only restore structural capacity, but also to enhance infrastructure service life. The structural repair process involves the replacement of deteriorated cover concrete with a less permeable patch repair mortar. The patch repair only restores durability of the structure; to restore or enhance structural capacity the repair process further involves bonding of FRP laminates. Particularly in the case of FRP's with a low elastic modulus, the design is often guided by serviceability limit states as opposed to ultimate limit states (ULS), resulting in an over-reinforced structural member. In addition, the reinforcement area of commercially available FRP strengthening may exceed the design requirements, especially at low levels of corrosion damage. In both the abovementioned considerations the design may result in an over-reinforced section. At the time when this researched was proposed, the effect of increasing damage extent on fatigue behaviour of over-reinforced RC beams was not clear and merited further investigation. A scientific experimental approach was developed to investigate the long-term performance of fifteen (15) full-scale 40MPa RC beams with dimensions 155x254x2000mm and ultimate capacity of 62.3kNm. Accelerated corrosion damage was induced in varied extents which included 450mm, 800mm, 1300mm and 1800mm length to a constant degree of 10% on all specimens. Specimens from each damage extent were patch repaired using SikaCrete214 and subsequently strengthened with externally bonded with SikaCarboDurS512 carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. Four-point bending monotonic loading tests were conducted on one (1) specimen from each damage extent. The results obtained from the quasi-static tests were used to determine two (2) cyclic loading stress ranges at which the remaining 2 specimens from each damage extent would be tested under. Under the 40% and 60% stress ranges four-point bending cyclic loading tests were carried out at a test frequency of 4Hz. Information was acquired on key performance indicators that included fatigue life, crack development, failure mode and stiffness degradation, where stiffness was assessed in terms of midspan deflection, composite material strains and neutral axis shift. Information on these parameters were collected using strain gauges, linear variable differential transducers (LVDT), DEMEC strain targets and digital image correlation (DIC). Ultimate failure loads under monotonic loading showed that despite having the highest degree of corrosion, the 450mm damage extent specimen had the highest failure load of 325kN. The failure load gradually reduced to 290kN as the damage extent was increased to 1800mm and the 0mm (control) specimen failed at the lowest load of 274kN. In contrast to the static behaviour, the specimen fatigue life enhanced by 106.3% as the damage extent was increased from 450mm to 1800mm. As expected, the 40% stress range tests yielded much longer fatigue lives than their 60% stress range counterparts. Furthermore, the experimentally obtained fatigue lives were compared to three fatigue life prediction models and the Helgason and Hanson model yielded the closest correlation with the experimental results. IV ABSTRACT Crack densities were found to increase with a longer fatigue life. An increase in damage extent was found to positively affect crack development and overall stiffness of the specimen during longterm fatigue testing. This finding was further substantiated by an assessment of midspan deflection, compression concrete strain and carbon fibre strain results, which all suggested a lower neutral axis and a lower stiffness reduction rate under fatigue loading as the damage extent was increased from 450mm to 1800mm. Furthermore, the tension concrete cracks propagated gradually during longer fatigue tests periods, while the tension steel and carbon fibre were comparably less affected by the resultant internal forces. Unfortunately, the neutral axis strain measurements using DEMEC targets were unable to assess the relative effect of an increase in damage extent as well as the compression concrete and carbon fibre strains were able to. During this experimental period, it was established that the laboratory layout was not conducive for carrying out the DIC process of long-term cyclic loading tests. The area in which testing took place did not adequately protect the camera against the environment and therefore required daily storage of the equipment. Regular movement of the camera for storage purposes introduced measurement inaccuracies which accumulated over longer test periods of up 20 days. However, for the short-term tests that did not require movement of the camera, the DIC process yielded favourable results. It was possible to capture the crack patterns early in the test period when the crack growth rate and development of new cracks was high using DIC. It was found that the high strain cracks coincided with the points of maximum vertical deflection (obtained through DIC) and eventual failure location of the specimen. The points of maximum deflection obtained from the DIC process were often not at midspan, which in the absence of the DIC process, would not have been possible to predict accurately. The results have shown that the specimens with the longer damage extents exhibit improved fatigue performance than their shorter counterparts. This revealed a stark contrast to their monotonic loading performance which favoured shorter damage extents. Furthermore, DIC holds potential to predict failure location more accurately than conventional approaches used for structural health monitoring (SHS).</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Public finance management reform and expenditure control in Ghana: the role of the ministry of finance in implementing the MTEF</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Public expenditure control is vital in countries because it is a key instrument for ensuring effective government strategic planning and policy priorities. In many countries, public expenditure control has been inadequately implemented because of weak accounting systems, a weak cash management system and a weak flow of information, among others, despite public finance management reforms implemented in developing countries. Public expenditure management has been a concern in Ghana's public service because of weak budget formulation, weak monitoring and evaluation, and an ineffective flow of information between the ministry of finance (MOF) and the key public institutions. The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) has been introduced in Ghana's public service but it has been faced with challenges after the initial stage of implementation of the reforms. This study sought to examine why public finance management reforms appears to have failed to control public expenditure in Ghana, by investigating the ministry of finance's (MOF) role in implementing the MTEF. The study employs a qualitative method using interviews with officials from the MOF to examine the role of the MOF in implementing the MTEF. The key themes that the researcher sought to test through the research as potential factors behind poor expenditure control included the coordination amongst other government institutions, weak planning and forecasting, monitoring and evaluation capacity, information management systems and cash management systems, the political environment and the commitment control. The findings revealed that, despite the importance of political environment and the commitment control, planning and forecasting, the monitoring and evaluation capacity, information management system and the cash management and the coordination management government institutions in implementing the MTEF by the MOF, the new public management framework is not well implemented as it should be. The findings also revealed that in implementing the MTEF by the MOF, coordination among other government institutions such as the MOF and the NDPC has been improved and overcoming the shortcoming of implementing the public finance management reform in Ghana.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Tearing the envelope: from tunnel to tower industrial typology</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The following dissertation responds to the industrially significant Maitland/Salt River area of Cape Town, Western Cape. Over time, industrial stock has resulted in ruin due to the unpredictable reality of industry, and competing for business globally. Exploring the possibility of the area to be developed as an industrially significant urban quarter seeks to revive investment in existing industry. The revival requires a shift in business and architectural model that encourages adaptability through rethinking the scale of production/manufacture and tenancy. Current single tenancy models operate with a ground floor sprawling line of production, prioritising the machine in a controlled environment. This requires a rigid form of enclosure, defined in this research as the envelope. Research has suggested that the scale of manufacture should decrease, providing the opportunity of a hybrid, mixed-use industrial typology. The intention is to vacate space on an industrial site to cater for an interface with the public. Visual and physical connections with the local urban condition will allow the factory to contribute to the revived intention of industrial urbanism in the area. The Jensen Belts leather factory will be used as this study's existing building to be adapted. Currently the circulation of production and goods is isolated from the circulation of the public which results in the factory creating a black box surrounded by negative space in the city. Prioritising the circulation of goods creates an environment that is not conducive to human comfort - highlighting the sheltering priority of the existing factory, to house goods and not people. Focusing specifically on leather production, rethinking the connection between the circulation of goods and people establishes the industrially significant presence through the theatre of production in the city. The proposal of a future factory lies in rethinking the production line model to limit the amount of space it occupies - offering loose space for multiple tenancy. Multiple tenancy describes the hybrid typology proposed to cater for the varying needs of the Maitland context. These needs involve employment and upskilling, which are catered for in a responding Community Workshop Model. The first architectural investigation seeks to 'tear' the tightly sealed factory building envelope once the controlled production line model shifts. The second architectural enquiry is in the design of an adaptable vertical tower that houses the possible phases of needs in the typical industrial building life cycle. The tower is seen to anchor a hybrid community workshop program. The existing building and site constraints, tunnelling the production process, provides a platform to propose a strategy for a new, bold structure that shifts the program to prioritise the comfort of the user. In response to the existing controlled production line model that excludes the public, the new model seeks to expose the program to connect to the site's range of urban networks positively. The area offers a wealth of key infrastructural networks (M5 highway underpass, railway, Black River, West end of Voortrekker Road) that have resulted in spatial boundaries. With the interest of 'tearing' the factory building envelope for integration, the urban investigation seeks to establish ways of inhabiting and crossing these architectural and urban boundaries to foster connection.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The study seeks to answer the research question: &quot;What constructs the gap between past and present literacy practices in the South African Police Service (SAPS)?&quot; To answer the research question, ethnographic methods were employed to gather data in a police station on the Cape Flats, renamed Phatisanani police station. In researching the gap between past and present literacy practices of police officers in the station, the effects the shift in institutional discourses from the early years of the South African Police (SAP), to after the 1994 democratic elections in South Africa had on police officers' professional discourses and their associated literacy practices were illuminated. The study suggests that institutional discourses after 1994 are conflicting with the professional discourse and associated literacy practices of police officers at Phatisanani police station. The research argues that the conflict between contemporary institutional discourses in the SAPS and the professional discourse of police officers in the station is leading to 'disorder of discourses' (Wodak, 199B). Drawing on theories from the New Literacy Studies the research concludes that the gap between past and present literacy practices in the SAPS is embedded in the 'disorder' between contemporary institutional and professional discourses, the 'disorder' between the social roles of 'insiders' and 'outsiders'; and the recontextualisation of literacy practices across various sites of practice in the SAP prior to 1994.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The title of this master's research is “semiotics of comic strips and French didactics”. It is about the use of comic strips in French teaching. The French people have a long story of comic strips that they can share with the South Africans for the teaching and learning of French as foreign language. I want to prove that comic strips are important for the teaching and learning of French, as foreign language. Foreign language teaching requires many methodologies from the teacher. Those skills and methodologies enable him/her to identify the needs of the learners and to teach them in the best possible ways. Cape Town is the field of my investigations because of its multilingualism. Most of South Africans can speak a first or/and a  second language, French can only be a third language. So as teachers, our teachingmethods must vary according to the learners' knowledge or absence of knowledge of French. For a better understanding of the French language, we cannot use the same methods and approaches for those two groups of learners, given that South African learners are going to use English as their educational language. To this end, I went to investigate some learners at their schools to find out the way French has been taught. I also wanted to know their views on the use of comic strips in the French class. There are two groups of learners, those who knew comic strips before I arrived at their schools and those who only knew comic strips because of my. I asked their teachers' views on the use of comic strips as material. Some use comics strips and some do not use. Learners and teachers were asked why they did or didnot use comic strips in class. Comic strips put together image and text.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Au Norm Import in the European Promotion of Regional Integration in Africa</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Arfsten, Antonia</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Akokpari, John</dc:contributor>

   <dc:description>The relation between the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) is the most institutionalised interregional relationship in the world. The EU, being a crucial external agent in African regional integration, exports open regionalism as a political norm through different mechanisms to the AU. Based on a qualitative research design with a constructivist theoretical viewpoint that regards regional organisations as interdependent political authorities, the dissertation examines the AU's receptivity to the EU's attempted norm diffusion and explores genuine AU norm import of European promoted regional integration. A document analysis of official EU and AU declarations and legislation in combination with primary data collected via semi-structured interviews with officials at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa offers further insights into the African perspective on regional integration. Out of a variety of EU norm export channels, the study identifies capacity-building in the form of technical and financial assistance as most influential in promoting African regional integration processes. While coercion and political dialogue respectively lead to AU resistance and decoupling alias theatre regionalism, capacity-building and positive conditionality result in institutional incorporation and policy changes. A choice-oriented approach traces this genuine norm import in response to civilian norm diffusion mechanisms back to the external agency of the EU, despite major constraints like the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU and alternative interregional options within the alliance of emerging market economies. Yet, the limited traceable AU institutional and policy reforms reveal the agency of the AU. Norm import cannot be taken for granted; it only occurs when sufficient incentives are offered to the receiving side. Political dialogue is inspirational, but needs to be supplemented with financial and technical assistance to yield genuine norm import. These findings contribute to a better understanding of prospective EU-AU relations and can be used by policy-makers to adjust interregional negotiations like the on-going post-Cotonou consultations.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The surgical management of vault prolapse : a reappraisal with and assessment of the sacrospinous colpopexy and sacrospinous cervicopexy</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Uterine Prolapse - surgery</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The study was undertaken to assess the results of the sacrospinous colpopexy procedure for the treatment of vault prolapse following hysterectomy. It was also to assess the results of the procedure in the treatment of marked uterovaginal prolapse and to compare its role in a group undergoing hysterectomy with a group in whom the uterus was conserved. A prospective study was undertaken between December 1991 and December 1992. Forty women with vm1lt prolapse following hysterectomy were included in one group. All these patients underwent posterior vaginal repair, enterocele sac obliteration and sacrospinous colpopexy. In 25 patients an anterior vaginal repair with sub urethral buttressing sutures was also perfom1ed. A long-needle bladder neck suspension operation was included for three women with coexistent stress incontinence. The mean follow-up period was six months. The success rate was 92%. Of the three failures one underwent a successful repeat sacrospinous colpopexy and repair. The main long-term complication was cystocele formation. A further 24 women with marked uterovaginal prolapse were also included. All women underwent anterior and posterior vaginal repairs, enterocele sac obliteration and sacrospinous ligament fixation. In 13 patients a vaginal hysterectomy was performed and in 11 the uterus was conserved. In the hysterectomy group the follow-up was four months. Although there have been no failures, one woman had developed a small asymptomatic cystocele. Follow-up in the group with uterine preservation was three and a half months. A gain, no failures were seen but three women had developed small asymptomatic cystoceles. There were no differences between the groups apart from a significantly shorter operating time in the patients who did not undergo hysterectomy. The sacrospinous colpopexy is effective in the treatment of vault prolapse. It avoids major abdominal surgery: and allows the surgeon to correct coexistent cystocele and rectocele. The procedure is a useful adjuvent to vaginal repair for marked degrees of uterovaginal prolapse, resulting in a well-supported vagina in the correct anatomical position.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is described more commonly in Caucasian populations in whom p.Phe508del is the most common mutation. There is a paucity of data of CF in black African children. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the presentation and outcomes of black African children with CF to those with p.Phe508del genotype. Methods A retrospective case-controlled study was conducted from January 2000 – March 2018 of children with CF attending two CF centres in South Africa. Presentation, genotype, nutrition and pulmonary function outcomes of black African children were compared to matched controls with the p.Phe508del mutation. Results Thirty-four black African children (cases) with median age of diagnosis (5.5 months, IQR 2.0- 15.0) were matched to 34 controls. Among cases, 3120+1G-&gt;A CFTR mutation was most commonly identified; homozygous n=22 (64.7%) and heterozygous=7(20.5%). Compared to controls, cases at diagnosis were more malnourished and fewer presented with neonatal bowel obstruction [cases n=2 (5.9%) vs. controls n=10 (29.4%); p = 0.03]. Nutrition and pulmonary function (FEV1 in children ≥ 6 years) outcomes and changes over time from ages 3-16 years were similar in both groups; median FEV1 z-score at age 6,10 and 14 years was -0.9 (±1.5), -1.8 (±2.0) and -1.8 (±1.9) respectively for all patients. Deaths were recorded in three cases (8.8%) and one control (2.9%) (p = 0.6). Conclusion Black African children with CF were more malnourished at diagnosis, and fewer presented with neonatal bowel obstruction. Cases and controls had comparable nutritional, pulmonary function and early mortality outcomes.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Randomised study of EndoRings™-assisted vs. standard colonoscopy for detection of polyps in at risk individuals with Lynch Syndrome</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Dhar, Rohin</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Goldberg, Paul</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>Surgery</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Introduction: Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition and is the most common cause of inherited colorectal cancer (CRC), contributing to approximately 3%-5% of newly diagnosed cases of colorectal malignancy. LS affected individuals bear 18% – 53% lifetime risk for development of CRC. The only therapeutic approach to prevent development of CRC among individuals with LS is periodic colonoscopic screening for detection and removal of adenomas and polyps, which are the precursors for cancer. Despite being the current gold standard, and accounting for all other variables (such as experience of the physician), conventional colonoscopy has been known to sometimes miss detecting adenomas/polyps, specifically those present in the folds of the colonic mucosa and on the inner luminal wall of the colonic flexures. EndoRings™ assisted colonoscopy has therefore been developed to improve colonoscopy outcomes in terms of enhancing adenoma detection rates (ADR)/polyp detection rates (PDR) and involves flexible silicone rings mechanically stretching the colonic folds and thus enhancing total colon visualisation. Objectives: The present study aims to primarily investigate the efficacy of EndoRings™ assisted colonoscopy compared to traditional colonoscopy in terms of ADR/PDR in a known cohort of individuals with LS in a South African setting. Methods: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional randomised controlled trial. Individuals from the Northern Cape province of South Africa with LS were enrolled into the study during our Annual Northern Cape Colonoscopy Outreach trip for the year 2015. A total of 54 individuals (per-protocol) were included in the study and randomised blindly using computer randomisation into a control arm undergoing standard colonoscopy (n=27) and a study arm undergoing EndoRings™-assisted colonoscopy (n=27). Number of polyps detected (the primary outcome) along with a set of secondary outcomes was recorded in real time on data sheets for each individual and statically analysed using IPython. Results: The female to male ratio in the EndoRings™ group was 19:8 versus 15:12 in the standard colonoscopy group (P = 0.40) whereas the mean age of patients was 43.98±15.27 years and 44.26±14.67 years (P = 0.05) respectively. The average number of polyps detected in the EndoRings™ group was 1.4 versus 0.9 in the non-EndoRings™ group (P = 0.60). Conclusion: The present study outcomes observed comparable ADR/PDR in EndoRings™ assisted versus standard colonoscopy with no statistically significant difference. This result may be due to the study's limitations (small sample size) and design. Though no statistically significant conclusions could be reached, EndoRings™ assisted colonoscopy was perceived as being helpful in terms of increasing total colonic visualisation and allowing better scope stabilisation during interventions. Comparable intubation times, withdrawal times, total procedure times and similar complication rates were observed in both study arms. Although this study demonstrated non-inferiority of EndoRings™ compared to standard colonoscopy, further studies with a larger sample size in an easily accessible population over a longer study period are recommended.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Introduction   Although adolescents have the highest force of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection1 and rapidly increasing burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease through 10–19 years of age,2 there are few studies on adolescent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, transmission, and TB disease in the WHO African region. Adolescents in the high TB burden countries of Africa are therefore an important, but neglected risk group for global TB control efforts. Adolescents spend a considerable amount of their time in school classrooms, but there is paucity of data on classroom risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has conducted measurement of air quality and air sampling for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in school classrooms, a novel approach that may support targeted TB disease case–finding strategies which may be more efficient than symptom–based TB screening in the congregate school setting. The overall aims of this PhD project were: 1) To conduct a systematic review of adolescent latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease prevalence, and to examine the relationship between adolescent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease rates, in high TB burden African countries. 2) To describe temporal changes in prevalence of LTBI among adolescents living in a single TB endemic South African community, across two time periods spanning the decade 2005–2015. 3) To describe temporal changes in adolescent TB disease notification rates in the same community for the decade 2005–2015. 4) To determine classroom ventilation risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in tandem with a pilot study of air sampling for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA; and to investigate the operational feasibility and yield of a pragmatic, symptom–based approach to TB disease surveillance in high schools.  Methods   To achieve Aim 1, we performed a bibliographic database search for studies conducted and published between 1990 and 2018 on prevalence of adolescent (10–19 years) LTBI and TB disease in high TB burden African countries. We calculated the ratio between the number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections based on Annual Risk of TB Infection (ARTI) estimates and the number of microbiologically–confirmed TB disease cases per year, and compared the observed ratio to the expected ratio of 8–12 published by Styblo et al.3 To achieve Aim 2, we collected adolescent LTBI (defined by positive QuantiFERON® –TB Gold In–Tube test) prevalence data from eight South African high schools, spanning the decade 2005–2015, from databases of an adolescent cohort study (2005–2007) and an adolescent vaccine trial (2014–2015). We used the two–sample test of equality of proportions to compare changes in LTBI prevalence over the two periods. To achieve Aim 3, we collected adolescent TB disease notification data from the same community (using an electronic tuberculosis disease register) for the decade 2005–2015 and we used the Mann–Kendall test to explore temporal changes in notification rates. To achieve Aim 4, we conducted a cross sectional study of 72 classrooms occupied by 1,836 high school learners, in addition to 7 comparator clinic spaces selected for high a priori risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, and performed ventilation (carbon dioxide concentration) measurement to define spaces with high ventilation risk (&gt;1,000 ppm) and ddPCR air sampling for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA, with active TB symptom screening among learners.  Results   1)	There is paucity of data on adolescent LTBI and TB disease prevalence in high TB burden African countries (1990–2018). Based on the limited available data, both LTBI (16%–55%)4–8 and TB disease prevalence rates are high (180–679 cases per 100,000),6–10 but corresponding infection–to–disease ratios are inconsistently low compared to that expected from Styblo's Rule.3 2) Overall adolescent LTBI prevalence remained high and relatively unchanged (44–49%) between 2005– 2015. 11 However, although average LTBI prevalence was unchanged in lower socio–economic quintile schools, prevalence increased in highest socio–economic quintile schools (from 20% to 38%).11 3) Adolescent TB disease notification rates fell 45% (662 to 361 per 100,000) in the same community over the same period. Despite this decrease, recent TB disease prevalence remains high and is three– fold higher in older (15–19 years) than younger (10–14 years) adolescents (566 vs. 151 per 100,000 in 2015). 4) More than one–third of 72 high school classrooms were inadequately ventilated and one–fifth of classrooms had evidence of airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detected by ddPCR air sampling. The average risk of inhaling 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA copy was similar between clinics and classrooms. Across all classrooms the average risk of a classroom occupant inhaling 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA copy over 1 lesson (35 minutes) was 0.71%; and the estimated risk over 1 academic year was 100%. However, yield from symptom–based TB screening was low, consistent with the presence of undiagnosed subclinical TB cases and risk of ongoing transmission in the school setting.  Conclusion   Despite the encouraging decline in adolescent TB disease notification rates observed between 2005–2015 in the study area, adolescent LTBI prevalence remains high, consistent with ongoing medium–term transmission. The relatively high proportion of inadequately ventilated classrooms would place learners at high risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission if exposed to an infectious occupant. This risk appears material, given the proportion of classrooms with a positive ddPCR air filtrate sample and the estimated cumulative risk of inhaling of at least one copy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. The presence of previously undiagnosed TB cases among learners is inferred from our classroom ddPCR air sampling data, which further suggest that pragmatic school–based TB symptom screening is an inefficient surveillance strategy that likely missed learners with subclinical TB. Improved ventilation in school classrooms is a low–cost intervention that may reduce the risk of TB transmission in schools. New and more efficient targeted TB disease case–finding strategies are needed for congregate settings, including schools, in high TB burden countries. Based on our preliminary data, classroom ddPCR air sampling for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA appears feasible for this purpose, but requires further research to optimise diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate cost–effectiveness and public health value in high TB burden countries.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Several benefits have been attributed to E-government, including the potential to promote independence and belongingness for persons with disabilities (PWD) by enhancing participatory and inclusive governance. Hitherto, government services that required several and long journeys followed by long queues waiting for service at government offices can now be accessed online irrespective of the geographical location via E-government services. As a result, developing countries like Ghana continue to commit resources to the implementation of E-government to harness the associated benefits. Accessibility has been acknowledged, by both practitioners and those in academia, as a key consideration to prevent disparities among citizens which may put PWD at risk of exclusion. However, providing solutions to accessibility challenges for PWD has consistently proven difficult in most E-government implementation projects in developing countries. Therefore, this study investigates the accessibility of Egovernment services for PWD in Ghana with the aim of identifying how key E-government stakeholders perceive accessibility and the contextual drivers that lead to the exclusion of PWD in the development of E-government services. Also, this study seeks to understand if and how these stakeholders and contextual drivers reinforce the exclusionary process. The study employed an interpretive, inductive approach, with sensitising concepts from Egovernment accessibility literature, and the social exclusion framework. Multiple data collection methods were used, namely; observations as a preliminary step to obtaining a better understanding of how the visually impaired use ICTs; interviews as the primary data collection technique from 37 participants; and document analysis. The study involved 3 groups of participants: the visually impaired, E-government web developers and government officers. Data analysis was carried out in two phases- firstly thematic analysis was used to report on perceptions of government officers and developers on accessibility and the experiences of PWD. Contextual drivers impeding accessibility and affecting accessibility experience of PWD were also derived from the thematic analysis. Secondly, E-government and disability policy documents mentioned in interview discussions were analysed using content analysis. The findings of the content analysis were used to validate, clarify and to conduct post-interview checking. The findings show that government officers and developers play a key role in the development of E-government services. Whilst Government officers and developers were identified as powerful agents whose practices determined the accessibility of services that were developed; PWD were side-lined and not involved in the E-government development project. Also, perceptions of government officers and developers on accessibility vary from those of PWD. While government officers and developers believe that with little assistance from third parties PWD can access E-government services, PWD perceive accessibility should offer them the independence to retrieve government information and engage in electronic transactions of their choice. Evidently, accessibility perceptions of E-government implementers differ from that of PWD. Further, the findings show that exclusion of PWD from E-government services is as a result of the intertwining of several contextual drivers, including political, socio-cultural, technological and personal. Political, socio-cultural and technological drivers influence the perceptions and practices of government officers and developers and determine their responses to the accessibility needs of PWD. Personal drivers limit the capabilities of PWD to access Egovernment services and impact on their accessibility experiences. Contextual drivers independently facilitate the exclusion of PWD; however, their interactions with government officers and developers shape their perceptions and constitute crucial exclusionary forces. These exclusionary forces when fed into the development of E-government services reinforce the exclusion of PWD. Given that personal drivers limit the capabilities of PWD, their inabilities to act as change agents reinforce their exclusion. Moreover, power differentials among stakeholders play a vital role in the exclusionary process. The study contributes to better understanding of influences on the E-government development process, how services become inaccessible and the accessibility challenges PWD face. Practically, the study has several implications on the development and implementation of E-government services in developing countries like Ghana. For example, the findings are useful to inform the political leadership on policies and structures to put in place to enhance the accessibility of Egovernment services for PWD.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Quality matters : electoral outcomes and democratic health in Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>In December 2007, Kenyans went to the polls to elect a president, Member of Parliament, and local councillor. As citizens who had most recently voted out one of Africa's longest standing &quot;Big Men,&quot; in Daniel Arap Moi, there was an understandable level of excitement and enthusiasm from citizens to exercise their vote once again, as well as from the rest of world which was eager to uphold Kenya as a model of African democracy. Unfortunately as the polls closed five days later; the Kenyan Electoral Commission had been disgraced, the two main political parties were mired in ballot stuffing accusations, and violence had engulfed Nairobi, Kisumu, and the Rift Valley. While the flawed election led to an irreplaceable loss of life and severely damaged the nation's economy and reputation, it is unclear whether this flawed election would diminish Kenyan's democratic health and progress towards democratic consolidation. Indeed, recent and compelling social science evidence suggests that flawed elections do not necessarily hinder democratic development in Africa, and thus the greatest indication of Kenya's democratic progress was simply that the election was held. However, as a witness to Kenya's 2007 election, I feared that Kenya's democratic progress would be severely impeded as people voiced their discontent with elections, voting, political parties, and most importantly, democracy itself. In an attempt to determine if in fact flawed elections have a long-term detrimental impact on democratic health and consolidation I investigate the relationship between the &quot;freeness and fairness,&quot; of elections {or electoral quality} and two indicators of democratic health: {1} popular perceptions of democratic supply and {2} popular demand for democracy. &quot;Supply,&quot; is measured as popular satisfaction with the way democracy works plus the recognition of living in a democracy. &quot;Demand,&quot; is measured as support for democracy plus rejection of three forms of authoritarianism, military rule, one man rule and one party rule. These indicators are aggregate measures taken from responses to Afrobarometer surveys, and have been utilized previously to assess citizen's views of democracy and the prospects for democratic growth and consolidation. Using three rounds of Afrobarometer surveys I analyze data from 18 countries and 33 elections in Africa between 1996 and 2005, using both elections and countries as the unit of analysis. The empirical results demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between electoral quality and perceived supply of democracy, but no correlation between electoral quality and the current level of demand. In other words electorates tend to see electoral outcomes as the preeminent event in determining how satisfied they are with democracy, but do not directly link the outcome of the most recent election to their support for democracy. Although the level of electoral quality did not directly correlate with the level of demand, further analysis showed that flawed elections on average negatively influence both supply and demand. Free and Fair elections, on the other hand, had a much smaller but positive influence on supply and demand. Taken together, there is compelling evidence to suggest that electoral outcomes do shape people's perception and support for democracy. If in fact citizen opinion and support for democracy is critical to democratic consolidation than this research finds that flawed elections can significantly impede democratic growth and retard the consolidation process.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A study of lexical borrowing and occasional code-switching amongst young middle-class Syrians in Saudi Arabia and Syria</dc:title>

   <dc:description>In this study, I examine language contact phenomena exhibited by two groups of young middle-class Syrian citizens. Members of one group were born and have been living with their families in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They however, have maintained strong relations with their extended families in Syria and visit them regularly. Because of this they are considered mobile and more exposed to other cultures and environments in which communication in English is prevalent. Contrastively members of the second group were born and have been living in their homeland Syria, so they did not have the exposure to other cultures that members of the first group had. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a developing country that has opened doors and jobs opportunities for millions of foreigners whose main medium of communication is English. This means that members of the first group who are resident in Riyadh have experienced more cross-cultural influences than their less mobile peers in Damascus. I set out to examine the impact of the mixed culture on the sociolinguistic repertoire and behaviour of the Riyadh-based Syrians as compared to their less mobile Damascus-based peers. In particular, the study aims to demonstrate the influence of language contact as reflected in code-switching and lexical borrowing. I conducted 20 interviews in the summer of 2008 in Syria. Both groups included an equal number of male and female participants. All interviews were conducted in friendly congenial settings which allowed participants to converse naturally. All instances of lexical borrowing and code-switching were catalogued. After analysing data from the two sets of speakers, it was found that whilst borrowing was prevalent in both groups, code-switching tended to be minimal. This shows that the degree of contact was not very intense. The difference in mobility, between the two groups, however, was reflected in their respective repertoires. In fact, mobility and exposure to other cultures was a major distinguishing factor between the participants. Members of the mobile group used more English lexical items than the less mobile group. The analysis was also done taking into account the participants' work experience. It was found that equal work experience resulted in similar findings across the gender line. The exposure to the world of work demanded higher levels of proficiency in English, since it was the language mostly used in the industrial-commercial environment. The use of English was also necessitated by computer programs and access to other technical and scientific information which was in English. The study also, showed that speaker's attitudes played a significant part in forming their linguistic behaviour albeit consciously or unconsciously. Speakers with a more accommodating attitude towards English tended to have more loanwords in their speech, across the two groups. Such code-switching as does occur in both groups shows no clear pattern that is linked to the type of schooling, mobility, or attitude, between the switcher participants, it was found that other personal experiences play a role. Personal experience that varies from individual to another according to their unique exposure to English media and other pleasure facilities, can be salient in strengthen one's English competence. Thereby, it gives the individual the ability to use the language more often and on a larger scale. Finally the study demonstrated that sociolinguistic repertoire was, to a large extent, a product of mobility and cultural exposure.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This investigation provides a learner perspective of the factors that affected the way in which they made meaning of science texts in Grade Eight where the medium of instruction was English. The investigation outlines the origins and objectives of the new curriculum within which the learner is located as this informs the extent to which learners have to engage independently with texts. It also describes the role of the textbook in society and education, the readability of texts and reading as factors that affect and therefore have an impact on the way learners make meaning from texts. While the aim of study was to gain a learner perspective of the factors shaping learners' engagement with texts, it also includes responses from teachers and textbook writers as these two groups have a direct influence on the way learners make meaning. The study highlights the contextual realities of where learners are at and provides strong evidence to suggest that learners' engagement with texts are affected by their low reading levels and the choices made by teachers and textbook writers in their selection and writing of texts, and points conclusively to the role of the teacher in mediating between learner and text.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background. The primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) constitute a diverse and everexpanding group of inborn errors affecting a wide range of immune functions. They are not well documented in Sub-Saharan Africa. An important barrier to care is limited awareness of PIDs and their management among health care professionals. This fascinating spectrum of diseases is rapidly expanding worldwide, and not as rare as we think. Genetic characterization and newborn screening for primary Immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) may be the gold standard in the first world setting but are neither practical nor feasible for our doctors. Yet, other low and middle income countries in the world have also established reasonable services and created registries for children with PIDs, including other African countries. Objective. To describe the spectrum of PIDs at a tertiary paediatric hospital. Methods. A retrospective descriptive study of PIDs diagnosed at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa between 1975 and 2017 was undertaken. Results. 252 children with PIDs were identified, spanning 8 of the 9 categories listed in the 2017 classification of the International Union of Immunological Societies. Predominantly antibody deficiencies, combined immunodeficiencies with associated syndromic features, and immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity accounted for 79% of all PIDs. The mean age (standard deviation) at diagnosis was 46 (50) months and the male to female ratio was 1.5:1. A history of parental consanguinity was present in 3 children (1.2%). Recurrent infection was the most prevalent presenting phenotype, manifesting in 70.2% of the patients. Genetic or chromosomal confirmation was obtained in 42/252 (16.7%) of the children. Common interventions used to prevent infection were antimicrobial prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy, administered to 37.7% and 36.9% of the patients respectively. Six of seven children who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had successful outcomes. The 7th patient died 2 months post-HSCT from overwhelming infection. Although we could not account for the children lost to follow up during the study period, 53 (21.0%) deaths were confirmed. Conclusions. Several challenges exist in the recognition and treatment of children with PIDs in our setting. These include limited access to genetic diagnostics and HSCT. Sub-optimal treatment options contribute to the overall mortality of PIDs in South Africa. Greater awareness among clinicians treating children and more laboratory diagnostic capacity are needed to increase the recognition PIDs among children in South Africa. The treatment options that are available in South Africa are unevenly distributed. Hence, treatment capacity should be expanded throughout the country, especially advanced interventions such as HSCT. Ongoing reporting of registries such as ours and increased community awareness should strengthen the lobby for greater investment in rare diseases such as the PIDs.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The influence of musculoskeletal variables on throwing performance in amateur and elite South African cricketers</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The game of cricket consists of batting, bowling and fielding. Each of these disciplines require different skills and physical capabilities. The literature exploring these disciplines have traditionally focused on batting and bowling with little research on fielding. However, the increase in popularity of the T20 cricket format has highlighted the importance of optimal fielding performance on the outcome of the game. Efficient fielding requires timely ball retrieval and a well-executed return-throw with the aim of dismissing a batsman or reducing the run rate. The novelty in this research lies in its meaningful contribution in identifying and understanding the musculoskeletal factors that contribute to optimal throwing performance specifically in cricket fielding. These factors may help in the development of an exercise intervention aimed at improving throwing performance in cricketers. The aim of this thesis was to determine and understand the influence of musculoskeletal variables on throwing performance in cricketers. Further it was to compare the musculoskeletal profile between amateur and elite cricketers and to investigate if the factors that contribute to throwing performance were different between the two groups Optimal throwing performance (speed and accuracy) is built on a complex interaction of multiple physical and visuomotor variables. An overview of the literature (Chapter 2) describes the multi-faceted contribution of a range of variables to throwing performance. It includes the contributions and interactions of both the musculoskeletal system and throwing biomechanics to throwing performance. It further compares the musculoskeletal and biomechanical profile of a cricketer to a baseballer and other throwers, as well as compares differences between amateur and elite throwers in relation to throwing performance. While baseballers have been described as superior throwers to cricketers, it is important to understand that the factors that make up optimal performance between the populations are different. Cricketers appear to have a different musculoskeletal profile compared to other throwers such as baseball pitchers. For example, cricketers do not demonstrate an increased shoulder external rotation gain as demonstrated by many throwers and have a markedly reduced shoulder rotational strength and hip strength compared to baseball players, amongst other factors. Biomechanically, cricketers tend to throw with a more side arm position with less shoulder external rotation which has been found to be an inferior position compared to an overhead throwing technique when considering both velocity and accuracy. In addition, playing experience and workload within the same sport may also influence the contributors to performance. Cricketers have been shown to have a lower workload threshold with regard to injury risk, compared to baseball, and therefore mismanagement of throwing workloads specific to cricket may have implications on injury risk and subsequently throwing performance. It can therefore be understood that optimal throwing performance is best achieved when training is not only customised to the sport, but to each individual player as well. The thesis includes two original papers. The first research paper describes the association between musculoskeletal variables and a throwing performance test to evaluate amateur cricketers. Throwing performance included ball velocity and a novel throwing accuracy test. The musculoskeletal variables included strength, range of movement, stability tests which have been previously used to investigate overhead athletes in a number of sports, for both injury prevention and performance. The aim of the second paper was to evaluate elite athletes with the same testing battery to identify if there were differences in musculoskeletal profile and throwing performance between cricketers at different playing levels and whether similar musculoskeletal factors accounted for throwing performance for the two groups. Data collection involved three main steps. First, demographic data, injury history, training experience and a shoulder function questionnaire was completed by participants. Secondly, musculoskeletal testing which included strength measures of the shoulder complex and hip, shoulder range of motion measures, scapula upward rotation positions and an upper-limb endurance test was performed on participants. Lastly, participants completed a throwing performance test which was performed indoors to control for environmental conditions. A maximal throwing speed test (measured with a radar gun) required players to throw over a distance of 20 m, as well as a maximal accuracy test which used a novel target board was performed. To investigate the association between musculoskeletal variables and throwing speed (TS) and accuracy (TA), bivariate analysis and multivariate linear regression analyses was performed for both groups. Paper 1 documents the association between a range of musculoskeletal variables and throwing performance (TP) in amateur cricketers. Of the 31 musculoskeletal variables, only one variable correlated with TS and one variable with TA. Specifically, hip abduction strength was positively associated with TS (r = 0.38) (p = 0.015): on average, a strength increase of 10 Newtons (N) was associated with an increase in TS of 0.60 km/h (95% CI: 0.12-1.08). Nondominant pectoralis minor length correlated positively with TA (r = 0.52) (p = 0.004): on average, a one-centimetre increase in the length correlated to an increase, of 0.633 points (95% CI: 0.225 - 1.041). Paper 2 documents the musculoskeletal variables that were associated with TP in elite cricketers, in addition to musculoskeletal differences between elite and amateur cricketers. Of the 31 musculoskeletal variables only one variable correlated with TS and one with TA in the elite group. Specifically, horizontal adduction range of motion was positively associated with TS (r = 0.38) (p = 0.045), on average, a one-degree increase in shoulder horizontal adduction range of motion was associated with an increase in TS of 0.46 km/h (95% CI: 0.012 - 0.920). Dominant internal rotation strength correlated positively with TA (r = 0.45) (p = 0.019): on average, a strength increase of 10 N was associated with an increase, of 0.34 points (95% CI: 0.06 – 0.62). Throwing speed and TA between groups were not significantly different. Six of the thirty-one musculoskeletal variables measured were found to be significantly different between groups. This signified that firstly, players of different levels may have different musculoskeletal profiles even when playing the same sport. Secondly this highlighted that even while TP had been similar, the variables that were associated with performance were different. The relationship between musculoskeletal variables and TP was further evaluated for the combined group of cricketers. In a combined group statistic, internal rotation strength (r = 0.35) and hip abduction strength (r = 0.72) were both positively correlated with TS (p &lt; 0.05) while pectoralis minor length was positively correlated with TA (r = 0.50) (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, from an array of musculoskeletal variables, throwing speed was positively associated with hip abduction strength in the amateur and combined groups, internal rotation strength in the combined group only, and horizontal adduction range of motion in the elite group only. Throwing accuracy was found to be associated with pectoralis minor length in the amateur and combined groups, and internal rotation strength in the elite group only. The musculoskeletal variables linked to TP were different between amateur and elite players. Further, the musculoskeletal profile of cricketers varied between experience levels. This suggests that optimal throwing performance interventions should be based on individual player assessment, or at the very least should be designed to the relevant game and experience level. A future controlled trial should investigate whether an exercise intervention aimed at increasing hip abduction strength in the amateur group, horizontal adduction range in the elite group, and shoulder internal rotation strength in both groups can improve TS; and whether increasing shoulder internal rotation strength in the elite group, and pectoralis minor length in both groups can improve TA.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Investigating temporal change in Fauresmith technology: Insights from Rooidam 2, Northern Cape Province, South Africa</dc:title>

   <dc:description>In southern Africa, stone tool assemblages with both large cutting tools (LCTs) and retouched blanks are ascribed to the Fauresmith Industry, a ‘transitional' industry between the Earlier and Middle Stone Age. ‘Transitional' assemblages are especially relevant for addressing questions concerning the development of increasingly complex behaviors and technological variability associated with later Middle Stone Age assemblages. Few in-situ Fauresmith assemblages have been described, despite the need for a more standardized and behaviorally meaningful understanding of these highly variable assemblages. Rooidam 2 is a pan site lying on the outskirts of Kimberley in the Northern Cape Province, with an excavated sealed and stratified Fauresmith sequence. The site is a suitable choice for investigation, as its sequence spans several strata and the excavated collection has yet to be described or analyzed in any detail. A technological intra-site analysis of ~2000 lithic specimens from Level 5, a dense concentration of artifacts comprised of 10 sub-levels was conducted in order to test for temporal change. Adjacent sub-levels were compared using both quantitative and qualitative data to test for statistically significant changes in the blank production choices and retouched tool morphology within the Fauresmith sequence. The analysis reveals that the Fauresmith assemblage from Level 5 is primarily characterized by centripetally flaked Levallois-like cores, flake and blade blanks, unifacially retouched points, scrapers, and notched pieces. There were no LCTs found in the assemblage, although a single broken fragment with bifacial flaking and a shaped convex edge has a morphology suggestive of a small biface. Although the lithic typology of the analyzed assemblage from Rooidam 2 is generally consistent with Fauresmith assemblages from nearby sites in the Northern Cape, the absence of bifaces and other LCTs is notable. The Rooidam 2 sequence also reflects instances of lithic variability between adjacent sub-levels that may be indicative of a trend towards increased behavioral flexibility in blank production (especially in the frequency of blade and unretouched points), although interestingly there were no significant changes in the retouched tool morphology. The variability within the sequence appears to be isochrestic in nature, and there is no evidence to support either a linear trajectory of lithic complexity or the reality of distinctive temporal phases within the Fauresmith industry at Rooidam 2. The technological characteristics in the assemblage, in addition to the significant instances of variability within the sequence, suggests that the lithic material from Rooidam 2 may be more appropriately described as eMSA rather than Fauresmith.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Understanding father involvement in the education of learners with intellectual disabilities in a special school in Kenya: a case study</dc:title>

   <dc:description>There are known benefits of father involvement in a child's life, such as positively affecting the child's life prospects, academic achievement, physical and emotional health as well as linguistic, literary and cognitive development. In African settings, fathers are traditionally the heads of families and the main decision makers in matters like the education of their children. However, a limited body of scientific knowledge exists on fathers' roles and involvement in the education of their disabled children in the African context. To address this knowledge gap, a qualitative case study to understand the nature of father involvement in the education of learners with intellectual disabilities in a special school in Kenya was conducted. The research question was: what is the nature of father involvement in the education of disabled learners at Sir Ali Special School, Kenya? The study was guided by theoretical perspectives from disability studies in education, masculinity and postcolonial theory. The field of disability studies in education focuses on the application of the social model of disability in an education context. The theories of masculinity look at the social construction of the male identity, and the postcolonial theory explores the colonial legacy of the study context. The data were collected from eight fathers, six mothers, nine teachers and six disabled learners using individual interviews, key informant interviews, draw-and-tell interviews, focus group discussions, document review and field notes. The data were analysed thematically. Three themes emerged from the data analysis: influence of cultural norms and values on father involvement, fathers' concerns in educating disabled children, and impact of understanding disability on father involvement. It was established that the intersection between patriarchy and masculinity affects normative gender roles that influence father involvement in the education of disabled children in a dynamic context. It was also evident that the cost of disability is greater than that of nondisability and this influences how fathers are involved in the education of their disabled children. Additionally, fathers wanted the best for their disabled children but different views about the purpose of the special school affected their involvement in the education of their disabled children. Furthermore, the meaning of disability influenced father involvement in the education of disabled children. It was concluded that father involvement in the education of disabled children in this African setting was complex and presented itself in ways that were different from what formal western education expected. This study provides critical new knowledge on how father involvement in the formal education of disabled children is constructed within the context of a specific school in an African setting. The new knowledge not only adds to the current limited evidence in the literature on father involvement, but also might assist education stakeholders like ministries of education and development workers in advancing best practice regarding implementation of family support structures for disabled children's education in Africa.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Does mood induction elicit emotion recognition biases? : an empirical study with implications for depression research</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Depression is a highly prevalent, debilitating, and sometimes-fatal mental illness. Typically, its treatment approaches are conceptualised as a dichotomy between psychological and pharmaceutical. However, a new model, in line with cogent philosophical reasoning and recent empirical evidence, integrates these approaches. The cognitive neuropsychological model places affective processing biases as central to depression aetiology and treatment-in both biological psychiatry and cognitive psychology. One affective bias, emotion recognition, is central to the tenets of this model, which, unlike some cognitive theories, places improved affective biases as temporally prior to improved mood, and as the underlying mechanism of antidepressant action. To test this account of emotion recognition bias, 103 undergraduate students participants underwent negative, positive, and neutral mood induction in a betweengroups design to assess whether mood-congruent emotion recognition biases would emerge in a multimodal (facial, vocal, musical) emotion recognition battery, while controlling for depression symptoms and assessing maladaptive cognitive schemas. Few significant emotion recognition biases resulted, but significant negative correlations between negative schemas and overall facial and musical accuracy emerged, even when controlling for depression lending some support to the cognitive neuropsychological model's premise of a bilateral relationship between schemas and emotion recognition, both of which may play a substantial role in the etiology of depression.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Final Year Medical Students' Experience of Bullying: A Study at the University of Cape Town</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Background: Medical bullying has been identified as a growing concern internationally, with multiple studies showing a high prevalence in medical students and residents However, several questions remain unanswered, including a) the prevalence of experienced bullying within our local, socioeconomic and ethnically diverse population, b) which population groups are most likely to bully medical students, c) significant demographic data which may impact on severity, frequency and type of bullying experienced, d) what is the correlation between severity, frequency and types of bullying with psychological distress in our local population. This study aims to 1) examine the association between bullying frequency and bullying types with demographic variables in this population, 2) to investigate the association of bullying severity, bullying frequency and psychological distress, and 3) to gather qualitative data on medical bullying in respondents Methods: The data for this research were collected from final year medical students. The questionnaire included the modified Quinne questionnaire assessing different types of bullying and related frequency, and the CORE-GP questionnaire assessing psychological distress. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data, and thematic analysis was used to assess the qualitative data. Results: There was a high prevalence of reported bullying (86.8%), with no significant differences of overall bullying across demographic variables. However, certain types of bullying were more commonly experienced by female and black students. Consultants and registrars were reported to bully students more frequently than nurses. Increased bullying frequency was significantly associated with higher levels of psychological distress. The main themes to emerge in the qualitative analysis were 1) Negative emotions relating to demographic bullying, 2)Systemised bullying within specific departments which according to the student are repetitive and expected, and 3) Feelings of academic pressure and fear associated to the bullying they have encountered Conclusion: This study suggests that the frequency of perceived bullying in South African medical students is consistent with rates reported in the literature. Bullying may follow the lines of medical hierarchies (with consultants being perceived as most likely to be the bully). Further, social disparities seem to be associated with increased bullying, with female and black students more often targeted. Specific interventions are needed to address bullying and associated psychological distress.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Dirhodium(II,II) paddlewheel complexes conjugated to a polypyridyl tris-amine scaffold: synthesis and application as asdjncaslpre-catalysts in the hydroformylation of 1-octene</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The hydroformylation reaction is the addition of CO/H2 (synthesis gas) to olefins using a transition-metal catalyst to produce linear and/or branched aldehydes. This reaction is in alignment with the Green Chemistry philosophy, applying principles such as using renewable feedstocks, atom economy, and catalysis. The use of rhodium-based catalysts for hydroformylation offers greater selectivity and catalytic activity under milder conditions compared to cobalt-based counterparts. Furthermore, the introduction of sterically demanding ligands such as phosphines are often introduced to enhance selectivity and activity of active catalysts. The conjugation of dendritic structures to transition-metal catalysts, to form metallodendrimers, may be useful in introducing functional groups that alter electronic and steric factors as well as increasing the activity through multinuclearity. Dirhodium(II,II) complexes contain two rhodium atoms, a metal-metal bond and an oxidation state of 4+ over the bimetallic core, resulting in each rhodium atom having an oxidation state of 2+. The electronic and steric influences can be altered by variety of ligands, bearing alkyl or aryl substituents. The purpose of this investigation was to synthesize and characterize a series of dirhodium(II,II) complexes, a suitably functionalized poly-pyridyl scaffold and conjugation of the synthesized complexes to the periphery of the scaffold to form low valent metallodendrimers. A series of diphenylformamidine ligands bearing electron-withdrawing (fluoro) and electrondonating (methyl) substituents at the ortho- and para-postions on the phenyl rings were synthesized. Two dirhodium(II,II) complexes bearing acetate bridging ligands with methyl or trifluoromethyl groups and four dirhodium(II,II) complexes, bearing synthesized diphenylformamidinate bridging ligands, were obtained. A trisamine-based pyridyl scaffold was synthesized and conjugated to each dirhodium complex to afford the corresponding lowvalent metallodendrimers. All ligands, complexes and metallodendrimers were characterized by spectroscopic (1H, 13C{1H}, 19F NMR, FT-IR) and analytical (mass spectrometry) techniques where applicable. The paddlewheel structure of the complex and pseudo-planar nature of the formamidine N-CN system was confirmed by Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The activity of the synthesized complexes and metallodendrimers were evaluated as catalyst precursors in the hydroformylation of 1-octene. Model reactions were carried out with dirhodium(II,II) tetraacetate as a precursor varying time, pressure and temperature resulting in optimized conditions for the formation of aldehydes, with negligible effects on the activity observed in the presence of mercury. Acetate bearing complexes showed near quantitative conversion (&gt;99.8%) of 1-octene, excellent activity and chemoselectivity toward aldehydes (&gt;98%) with moderate regioselectivity towards linear products (40-44%). Excellent conversion (97-99%), moderate to good chemoselectivity toward aldehyde products (59-87%) and moderate to good regioselectivity (48-71%) where obtained for diphenylformamidine compounds. Coordination of the trisamine-based scaffold leads to a general decrease (ca. 10%) in the chemoselectivity toward aldehydes and an anticipated general increase in the regioselectivity towards linear aldehyde of between 3-5% under optimized hydroformylation conditions. Chemoselectivity towards aldehydes was favoured by electron-donating groups over electronwithdrawing groups in the diphenylformamidinate complexes, with regioselectivity favouring linear aldehydes observed for analogous complexes containing electron-withdrawing groups.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research attempts to explore the complexities of the issues underlying the instability in the South African minibus-taxi industry. Presented in this dissertation is a detailed account of the growth and development of the industry and the conflict and violence that has plagued it since the late 1980s. A review of the apartheid government's attempts to address the problems in the taxi industry, is followed by an examination of the democratic government's strategies to bring about the industry's stability through transformation, formalisation and regulation. Of particular interest is the nature of the relationships that exist both within the taxi industry and between the industry and government, more specifically, law enforcement agencies. The challenges facing future regulation of the industry are then highlighted.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic, heritable blood disorder with affected individuals suffering from debilitating health issues and requiring frequent hospitalisation. SCD is highly prevalent in areas of the world where malaria is endemic and specifically in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region from where a number of migrants flee to South Africa. This has resulted in increased numbers of SCD patients in the South African healthcare system requiring holistic treatment and care, and ultimately improvement of their health-related quality of life (HRQL). There is limited empirical information on issues related to HRQL in SCD in Africa, with none available on adults living with SCD in South Africa. For this reason, this study was carried out with the aim of qualitatively exploring the perceptions of HRQL in adult SCD patients at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. Participants were selected from Groote Schuur Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in Cape Town, South Africa using a purposive sampling method. Participants were asked about how their condition affected physical and psychological functioning, effects of their health on relationships and social issues such as education and employment opportunities as well as discrimination. Perceptions of access to and satisfaction with healthcare, coping strategies and independent living skills were also explored. The data collected for this study were analysed using the framework approach and thematic content analyses methods. Results suggest that participants believed their functioning was affected by the constant and unpredictable nature of SCD clinical events, and this was seen to have social, financial and psychological implications. Environmental factors such as weather, activity and psychological state had significant impact on participants' health, with pain being a common complication of the condition often making coping with the condition difficult. Participants also experienced health-related discrimination and stigma in personal and social relationships and within the workplace often with negative emotional consequences. Both the positive and negative experiences with healthcare were also described. Participants found ways to cope with their condition but it appeared that SCD had more of a negative overall impact on various domains of HRQL for participants. Insights in to the impact of SCD on adult patients is important to allow for healthcare professionals to better understand patient needs and to implement more effective coping and self-management strategies appropriate for their patients. It also allows for genetic counselling services to be better tailored to addressing the concerns and needs of patients to provide better educational and psychosocial support.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Precipitation of nickel and cobalt sulphides using different reactor configurations</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Swartbooi, Ashton Mark</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>Chemical Engineering</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The nickel reduction process produces a stream containing unreacted dissolved nickel and cobalt. Removal of these metals to optimum levels is desired, however, the product should also be easy to handle and the process easy to incorporate into the current system. There are various precipitation agents that can be used to remove metals from solution, these being hydroxide, carbonates or sulphides. Sulphide precipitation has been gaining increased attention because of the advantages it holds above the other methods. These include:  -  attainment of high degree of metal removal over a broad pH range; - effective removal of metals such as As, eu and Hg even at low pH; - low retention time required in the reaction tank because of high reactivity; - feasibility of selective metal recovery There are various methods of introducing the sulphide into the system as well, with a soluble sulphide source most commonly used. The problem with this, and coupled to the high reactivity of the sulphide ion, is the creation of high local supersaturation. The supersaturation governs all precipitation and crystallisation processes in the way that it features in nucleation and growth rates. In crystallisation processes, the supersaturation can easily be controlled by thermal methods of evaporation or cooling. However, in precipitation, the creation of supersaturation is by a reaction, which commonly leads to high supersaturation. Thus, to obtain a product that has good filterability and settling ability, methods for controlling the supersaturation in precipitation reactions needs to be investigated.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Autism screening in children: using the social communication questionnaire in a Western Cape population</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a global prevalence of approximately one percent of all new births. There is a lack of literature on autism in South Africa. South African children are waiting years for diagnoses, despite the fact that early diagnosis and subsequent intervention appear to have a positive effect on the outcomes of the intervention. A screening device to detect ASD could be used to speed up the diagnostic process. This study tested the viability of using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) in a Western Cape state-funded hospital. This thesis describes Phase 1 of a larger study. The 40 item SCQ was adapted and translated into Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa versions of the SCQ were administered to parents of very young children attending the Red Cross Children?s Hospital?s developmental clinic (N = 228, age range of children = 3.00-5.97 years). Positive results were that no relationship was found between age and SCQ score, or between SCQ language version and SCQ score were found. However there was a relationship between SCQ score and socioeconomic status, indicating a possible bias in the SCQ. Internal reliability of the SCQ versions was analysed and was satisfactory. The factor structure of the English SCQ was examined. Two and four factor solutions were explored, with the two factor solution proving the best fit with good internal reliability. This two factor solution reflected the recent changes to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as well as previous findings on the SCQ and the ADI-R, the diagnostic instrument on which the SCQ was based. Preliminary results of Phase 2 of the larger study were analysed. Eighteen children received an Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) assessment;; the current gold standard for diagnosing ASD. SCQ scores proved to be a good predictor of ASD diagnosis, predicting 17 out of 18 individuals correctly. Further research on isiXhosa and Afrikaans versions of the SCQ as well as the predictive power, sensitivity and specificity and cut-off scores for the SCQ is recommended.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The HIV/AIDS pandemic has introduced significant challenges to health care professionals, specifically the appropriate means of supporting those living with the virus. Little research, however, has critically investigated the difficulties involved in the creation of community interventions in this area. In addition, few men's only HIV/AIDS support groups exist and a relatively modest amount of literature surrounds the subject. This thesis, aims to investigate the struggles and tensions involved in the formation of men's only HIV/AIDS support groups.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Tilting the playing field: labour absorbing growth and the role of industrial policy</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Black, Anthony</dc:creator>
   <dc:description>South Africa faces a severe problem of persistent structural unemployment. This results not only from low growth but more importantly from the pattern of growth over many decades. The recent recession aside, there has for the past several years been a significant improvement in South Africa?s growth performance. However, although new jobs have been created, this has been at a frustratingly slow pace and it would be difficult to argue that there has been a structural shift to a more labour demanding growth path. The data remain controversial but even the more optimistic projections show that very large scale unemployment will remain a major problem even under quite optimistic growth scenarios. If it were not for increased social payments, poverty would have continued to increase over the period.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Apolipoprotein biosynthesis and turnover in mammalian small intestine</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Apolipoproteins - biosynthesis</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>Intestine, Small - metabolism</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The mammalian small intestine is a major site (second in total activity only to the liver) for the synthesis and secretion of plasma apolipoproteins, and contributes significantly to overall whole-body lipid dynamics. A prominent feature of the small intestine is its exposure to periodic loads of meals often containing dramatically varying amounts or types of food components, including lipids such as tri-acylglycerols, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Since the trans-epithelial transport of most of these latter materials requires the elaboration of particles partially covered by apolipoproteins, the regulation of the biosynthesis or, more correctly, the availability of these proteins is an important and as yet little-understood problem. Previous studies have been conducted on systems which, for one or the other reason, have not permitted the following questions to be satisfactorily or coherently answered: Does the ingestion of fat-containing meals, either acutely or chronically, increase the rate of biosynthesis of intestinal apolipoproteins such as apo B-48, and is this the principal method of matching the &quot;demand&quot; with the supply of this &quot;packaging material&quot; needed for fat transport across the intestinal epithelial cells? Alternatively, does the maintenance of a large steady-state intracellular pool in the face of variations in intracellular apolipoprotein degradation, controlled by acute or chronic lipid ingestion, produce the required &quot;match&quot; between supply and demand for these proteins (as has recently been suggested in studies on liver cells)? An in vitro system was therefore devised whereby sheets of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) were freshly isolated from the jejuna of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and incubated for several hours in a medium supporting steady-state protein synthesis, in a manner which was assumed to be similar to the activity just before the killing of the donor animals. (Hamsters appear on various grounds to be a better small-animal model of human lipoprotein metabolism than the more commonly studied rats). The isolated epithelial cell sheets produced primary apolipoprotein products that could be extracted from the cells or detected in the incubation media, free from the subsequent modifications that they are known to undergo in vivo. Hamsters maintained on a low-fat chow were either studied as such or subjected to a variety of dietary treatments designed to maximize (over short or long time periods) intracellular apolipoprotein requirements for the &quot;packaging&quot; of tri-acylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, especially chylomicrons: acute bolus administration of lipid into the gut; overnight feeding of fat-enriched food; and chronic (six week) fat feeding. Using specific antisera and immuno-precipitation techniques, apo B-48 and two other principal intestinal apolipoproteins were shown to be synthesized in the steady state by intestinal cell sheets derived from control animals and from those subjected to acute or chronic fat-containing diets. Secretion took place, however, only when prior fat exposure of the donor intestines had occurred. Pulse-chase labelling was used to compare the rates of apolipoprotein synthesis, degradation and secretion in the same cell sheet preparations. The rates of apolipoprotein B-48 synthesis did not vary significantly under conditions of low or high trans-epithelial lipid flux, supporting findings derived from in vivo experimental systems. In contrast with data from other systems, however, the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein A-IV was not reproducibly increased on fat challenge. The rates of apo B-48 degradation varied significantly and were markedly reduced under conditions of fat feeding. The experiments permit a choice between the two alternatives mentioned above: Ingestion of fatty foods, either acutely or over long periods of time, does not increase the rates of biosynthesis of apolipoproteins such as apo B-48; but variations in the rate of intracellular degradation of this and probably other apolipoproteins allows the intestinal cells to match their requirements for lipid-transporting molecules to the demands of any given situation, relying in each case on a large steady-state intracellular pool maintained by &quot;constitutive&quot; biosynthesis. Importantly, there seems also to be a specific, possibly related effect of fat feeding on the secretion of lipoproteins into the intestinal extracellular fluid. These conclusions coincide with those obtained by other workers from studies of apolipoprotein B dynamics in isolated hepatocytes and in the hepatoma-derived liver cell line, Hep G2. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are as yet unresolved.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>for humans.This has lead to its use as a biological weapon and a therapeutic agent. the reaction mechanism of ricin is not known and so rational design is limited, resulting in no effective inhibitor being found for this enzyme. An important step towards understanding the reaction mechanism and the design of effective inhibitors is the complete understanding of the binding pocket and the mode/nature of binding ligands to the protein. In this thesis computational methods were used to rationalise the effect of selected ricin inhibitors.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Management Practice</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The management of projects has been area of intense study for many years, yet few researchers have ventured outside parameters of the mainstream concerns. This research aims to move outside the parameters of mainstream project management research, in order to explore other perspectives, with the purpose of illuminating new concerns and agendas. An abductive research strategy within a single case study was utilized to obtain rich data and new insights. This research seeks to uncover the social forces that influence the adoption of mainstream project and programme management standards and structures. The literature revealed that mainstream project management has idealogical foundations rooted within a 'Cartesian-Taylorist' paradigm and these have affected the development of programme management. The empirical findings indicated that a superficial understanding existed regarding the motivation for the adoption of project management standards and structures, within the case company. In addition, it was noted that the adoption of these project management standards and structures was perceived to provide more control and legitimacy. A consequence of these practices, within the case organization, is that it created a strong resource dependence on external consultants. The theoretical explanations illuminated that the desire for control, reducing uncertainty and the need for competitiveness serve as social forces towards the adoption of mainstream project and programme management standards and structures. Furthermore, the research explored the consequences of this phenomenon, within the case organisation.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the most widely used method for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) in adults and active TB disease in children. This work presents the development of a screening tool to detect LTBI's, which works in conjunction with the TST and serves as an alternative for measuring the TST induration. The screening tool makes use of a mobile application developed on the Android platform to capture images of an induration, and photogrammetric reconstruction using Agisoft PhotoScan to reconstruct the induration in 3D, followed by 3D measurement of the induration with the aid of Python functions. The screening accuracy of the developed process was tested using a 3D printed induration and an HTC One smartphone to capture images. In this accuracy test, the developed screening tool was found to measure indurations more accurately than current measurement methods, as indicated by the lower standard deviation produced. An experiment to simulate real-world conditions was conducted by using the developed screening tool on a set of mock skin indurations, created by a make-up artist, and evaluating its performance. It was found that the height of the skin induration and definition of its margins are the most significant factors that influence the accuracy of the screening tool under simulated real-world conditions. Future work should explore possible improvements to the developed image capture protocol and the bimodal segmentation methods employed in this project.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), affects people around the world. Certain communities in South Africa have among the highest reported incidences of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. Although PAE-related brain alterations have been widely documented, the mechanisms whereby alcohol affects the brain are not clearly understood. MRI relaxation parameters T1, T2, T2* and proton density (PD), are basic tissue properties that reflect the underlying biology. The present study aims to advance our understanding of how PAE alters the microstructural properties of tissue by examining PAE-related changes in these tissue parameters in adolescents with FASD. Methods: The final sample used in this study consisted of 53 children from a previously studied longitudinal cohort (Jacobson et al., 2008) and 12 additionally recruited subjects. Of the 65 participants, 18 were diagnosed with FAS or partial FAS (PFAS) and made up the FAS/PFAS group, 18 were diagnosed as heavily exposed non-syndromal (HE) and 29 were age matched controls. Subjects were scanned at the Cape Universities Body Imaging Centre (CUBIC) located at Groote Schuur Hospital on a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI. Structural images were obtained using the MEMPRAGE sequence. From these images T1, T2, T2* and PD parameter maps were constructed and segmented into 43 regions of interest (ROI) using Freesurfer, FSL and AFNI. Linear regression analyses were used to analyse group differences as well as correlations between parameter values and the amount of alcohol the mother consumed during pregnancy. Results: Significant T1 differences were found in the caudate, cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, accumbens, putamen, choroid plexus, ventral diencephalon (DC), right vessel and ventricles. Significant T2 differences were found in the caudate, brain stem, corpus callosum (CC), amygdala, cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, vessels and ventricles. Significant T2* differences were found in the cerebellar cortex, optic chiasm and ventricles. Significant PD differences were found in the hippocampus and left lateral ventricle. The exploratory nature of this study resulted in none of the results surviving FDR correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Overall, our findings point to regional PAE-related increases in water content and cellular and molecular changes in underlying tissue of the anatomical structure. Exceptions were the right cerebral cortex, brain stem, hippocampus, amygdala and ventral diencephalon where our findings point to less free water and increased cell density, and cerebellar cortex where simultaneous reductions in T1 and T2* suggest the possibility of increased iron content. In highly myelinated white matter structures, such as the CC and optic chiasm, our results point to PAErelated demyelination, and possibly increased iron. These findings extend previous knowledge of effects of PAE and demonstrate that tissues are affected at a microstructural level.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Decision analysis is a scientific tool that is traditionally applied in business and not to electrical engineering decisions. The reason for this research is to show how to use decision analysis to make a decision on the size of a power factor correction capacitor to be installed in an end-user plant in an electrical power system, that has the potential for harmonic resonance. How to make a decision as to whether or not mitigation is needed is also researched. The two-stage decision theory process, developed by management scientists, to assist decision makers on making a decision when uncertainty, risk and certainty situations-exist, is reviewed in this thesis. To understand the application of decision theory, worked examples are included to improve understanding and to provide a foundation for the new work introduced. The addition of capacitors to a harmonic carrying system can result in resonance. Harmonic levels can be magnified well above accepted limits and this can cause damage to system components, especially capacitors. Recognizing and correcting a harmonic resonance problem before disastrous consequences arise is essential for system designers. Traditionally, when considering harmonic resonance, power factor correction capacitors are sized heuristically and a power factor of 0.95 is taken as a starting point. Usually, a harmonic analysis software package is used and a frequency scan study is conducted to generate a resonance curve. Resonant points are then compared to the harmonics in the system. If there is coincidence, the technique of de-tuning is applied to overcome overlapping and to choose the capacitor size. For utilities to maintain system efficiencies at acceptable levels, they encourage end-users to use a capacitor size so that the power factor has a value greater than 0.9 and as a rule of thumb, correction is not done to unity. This traditional technique is subjective and lacks decision structure. A new three-stage decision theory process for making a harmonic resonance mitigation decision in an end-user plant is developed. Two new indices are developed to assist in making the decision. The first index assesses the severity of resonance and the second is used to make a mitigation decision. In Stage 1, a quantitative model is developed to structure and represent the decision problem with the harmonic resonance severity index as the objective function. The model uses a fixed capacitor based on full load rating as this represents the worst case. In Stage 2, Utility Theory is used as the decision criterion to select the most desirable capacitor size. In Stage 3, the mitigation index is applied to assess if mitigation is needed or not for the chosen capacitor. Three case studies, based on deterministic models are conducted and they demonstrate the effectiveness of this newly developed decision theory process.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In this thesis, equality is considered as the absence of differences in utilization among individuals of different socioeconomic status while equity is taken to mean that individuals in equal need of health care should use the same amount of care, irrespective of their socioeconomic status. Using the above definitions, this thesis, examines equity/inequality in the utilization of public health care in Zambia. Concentration curves, concentration indices and horizontal equity indices were used for this purpose. This thesis focuses specifically on public health care that is subsidized by the Government. It is anticipated that the findings of this thesis will broaden the knowledge base on health care utilization inequities in Africa.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an imaging technique that creates two dimensional images of the scattering objects in the illuminated ground scene. The objects in the illuminated ground scene may be truly stationary, e.g. buildings etc. or in motion relative to these stationary objects, e.g. cars on a highway. In SAR, the radar platform is moving during the imaging period, hence everything that the radar illuminates has motion relative to the radar platform. In order to specifically detect objects on the ground that are moving relative to stationary ground objects (often termed clutter), processing techniques called Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) techniques are required. This is especially required for targets that are moving at relative velocities lower than the stationary clutter's relative velocity to the radar platform (endo-clutter detection). This dissertation investigates five multichannel GMTI techniques being Displaced Phase Centre Antenna (DPCA), Along Track Interferometry (ATI), Iterative Adaptive Approach (IAA), Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) and Velocity SAR (VSAR) in literature and assesses the performance of two selected GMTI techniques (ATI and DPCA) on simulated and measured radar data to compare them and identify their strengths and weaknesses. The radar data were measured with a C-band FMCW radar in a controlled environment with known parameters and cooperating targets. The performances of the techniques were assessed in terms of moving target detection within clutter and sensitivity to inaccuracies in the physical system setup. The DPCA technique exhibited some attractive characteristics over the ATI technique. These included its robustness against false alarm in noise dominated cells - ATI exhibited large phase residuals in noise dominated cells, due to the random nature of the phase in these cells. Furthermore, DPCA seem to not suffer from false alarms due to volumetric scattering of vegetation to the extent that was observed with ATI. Lastly, DPCA exhibited more robustness against temporal misalignment errors introduced between the measurement channels, compared to ATI. These observations lead to the conclusion that DPCA would be a practically better choice to implement for the purpose of moving target detection, compared to ATI. However, a double threshold approach, which used DPCA as a pre-processing step to ATI, proved to be superior to DPCA alone in terms of moving target indication within clutter and noise. This approach was verified through implementation on the measured radar data in this study.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The effects of subsidized housing on the property values of neighbourhoods within its vicinity</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Malgas, Shannon M</dc:creator>

   <dc:description>Over time neighbourhoods have shown opposition to Government subsidized housing programmes being developed within their neighbourhoods. This is due to the perceived negative impacts that these housing developments have on the neighbourhood. Opposition has grown since implementation of the Housing Code of 2009. The Code aims to integrate low income households into more affluent areas, in order to provide these households with greater access to economic and social opportunities, which they were previously denied having been placed on the urban periphery. Opponents to subsidized housing developments have nevertheless expressed concerns with a possible decline in property values. These concerns are however based on perception, rather than factual evidence to this effect. There is a paucity of studies on the topic within the South African context. While there are a number of studies on the topic within other countries, the results cannot be generalized due to the difference in demographics, housing subsidy programmes and structure of the City of Cape Town. An analysis of the impact within the City of Cape Town context may thus be beneficial. This paper analysed the impacts of Residential Development Programme (RDP) housing and Social Housing (rental) projects, as these are the subsidized housing developments that have received the most opposition. The paper has thus used a Difference-in-Difference Hedonic Pricing Model analysis to determine the neighbourhood impacts of subsidized housing on the property values of surrounding neighbourhoods. RDP housing was estimated to have a negative effect on proximate property values, while Social Housing was estimated to have no effect. It is recommended that future developments are aesthetically appealing, have landscaping, are well maintained and are well integrated with the surrounding community. These efforts should also be well communicated to the host communities during the public participation events. Further analysis is required to determine the cause of the negative effects of the RDP development to ensure that these are mitigated in future RDP projects. These may allow the State to provide the much-needed housing opportunities, with limited opposition from the host communities.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Anti-discrimination, one of the central principles of South Africa's Constitution and Bill of Rights, is central to the Early Childhood Development curriculum. The anti-bias, or anti-discrimination, approach challenges prejudice and oppression of all kinds and aims to develop self-esteem, respect for diversity, awareness of human rights, and a sense of fairness in all children. This study examines the use of the Persona Doll Approach as a component of anti-bias practice in order to learn more about the approach, and about how it is used to engage with the realities of bias in the ECD phase of education in the South African context of poverty, and past and present discrimination. The study was conducted under the auspices of Persona Doll Training, South Africa (2003 - ). Four hundred and twenty Early Childhood Development, foundation phase and preschool teachers from different socio economic, rural and urban contexts in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, participated in the study. All of the teachers received Persona Doll Approach training, which they then applied in their classrooms. The study adopted a qualitative approach that included teacher questionnaires, observations, interviews and trainer reports, to gain an understanding of how the teachers used the Approach and what anti-bias understandings were reflected in their practice. Vignettes based on observations were constructed to illustrate the application of the Approach. They provide a vivid picture of the classroom situation and atmosphere. Four Anti-bias Goals: Identity and self-esteem, empathy, unlearning negative attitudes, and problem-posing/ activist approach provided the conceptual framework for the study. The findings indicate that the PDA training and subsequent classroom implementation led, to a greater or lesser extent, to improved self-esteem, empathy and the ability to challenge and unlearn discrimination among both the teachers and the children. Thus, the Anti-bias Goals were achieved, at least in the short term. There were also other, unexpected, outcomes. These included proactive activist work by some teachers, positive behaviour changes in children, the emergence of children's voices, and greater appreciation of children's voices by teachers. The study also highlighted teacher's and children's prejudices, and lack of support for teachers as challenges. Based on the findings, recommendations are made for the development of the PDA, and related training and teacher support, and for further research. The study confirms the value of the PDA approach and provides the motivation for continuing, and expanding, Persona Doll Training - South Africa.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Future climate is projected to deviate from present-day by unprecedented measure, hereafter climate departure, with direct consequences on food security. West Africa, one of the hotspots for climate departure globally, has suffered significantly from climate change impacts via extreme events with large impacts on food production. A better understanding of the impact of climate departure on crop growth suitability and planting season is still unknown and is highly needed in West Africa, owing to its high vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. This thesis developed a methodology aimed at defining the cropping system to investigate the projected timing of climate departures from historical variability and their impact on crop growth suitability over West Africa. For the study we used 4 statistically downscaled Global Climate Models, GCMs at station level for the period 1951- 2100 under RCP8.5 across the three AgroEcological Zones (AEZs) of West Africa for eight crops, cassava, maize, mango, orange, pearl millet, plantain, pineapple and tomato. Climate variables minimum mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation were used as input crop suitability model, Ecocrop to develop a new approach to define and characterise cropping systems departure from their normal regime, called crop-climate departure (CCD), to better understand the timing of future changes in crop suitability. Also, the concept of CCD was defined, tested and applied in West Africa for five different crops types, using 10 GCMs downscaled by regional climate model, RCA4 as input into crop suitability model Ecocrop. The downscaled GCMs were also employed to examine the impact at the different global warming levels, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0oC on crop suitability over West Africa. Using the GCMs at station level, we develop the concept of crop-climate used in characterizing the suitability of different crop across the three AEZs of West Africa. The result highlights the constraint, a reduction in suitable area, of growing cassava and pineapple only in the Guinea zone by mid and end of century. In contrast, there is an observed and projected opportunity, increase in suitable areas, of growing maize in southern Sahel by the end of the century while mango remains suitable across the three West African AEZs. The application applying the concept crop-climate departure on different crop types showed in decrease suitable areas for most crops by the end of century with horticultural, cassava and cereals respectively are the crops mostly affected. The changes in crop-climate relationship suggests a future constraint in crop suitability could be detrimental to future food security over West Africa. Finally, our findings from the impact of different global warming levels, 1.5. 2.0 and 3.0oC highlights the potential of sustained suitability for all the crops and improved food security under 1.5oC global warming for all the six crops but a contrast under 3oC over West Africa except for cowpea and groundnut. Our findings for cowpea and groundnut showed an increase suitable area into the southern Sahel with increasing global warming level. The study holds great value at regional scale where improved preparedness and regional cohesion could make the difference in making decision for a food secure Africa. Further studies to explore associated short and long-term adaptation options to changes in crop-climate relationship are recommended.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Gracilaria (Rhodophyta) encompasses some of the world's most valuable agarophytes and has accordingly been the subject of much research in recent decades. Gracilaria, however, has presented a problem to taxonomists over the years in that extreme phenotypic variability in certain entities, and the occurrence of similar morphologies among different taxa (in both Gracilaria and Gracilariopsis), combine to impede species recognition. Gracilaria and Gracilariopsis occur naturally from the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa to northern Namibia and the genetic variation within this widespread species or species complex is unknown. In this study, samples were connected from various locations within the Langebaan Lagoon-Saldanha Bay system and the nearby St. Helena Bay. Their positions were accurately mapped with the aid of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Reproductive structures are of great taxonomic importance within the Gracilariaceae. The local utility of reproductive features is questionable however, as south western Cape material is very seldom fertile which presents a problem for identification. External morphology lacks taxonomic significance due to the isomorphic nature of terete taxa. It was found that one cannot differentiate between Gracilaria gracilis and Gracilariopsis longissima based on external morphology. Adding to this, it was found that under varying ecological conditions different external morphologies occur. Although these specimens appear different externally, molecular studies show that they belong to the same species. Various molecular methods have proven successful in differentiating within and between populations, species and genera in the Gracilariaceae. Sequencing results of a 299 bp variable region of the ISS rRNA gene reveal that G. gracilis predominates in the Langebaan Lagoon-Saldanha Bay system, whereas Gp. Longissima predominates in the St. Helena Bay system. From the AFLP data one can infer that Saldanha Bay isolates display moderate divergence, probably due to favourable ecological conditions in this locality.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The epidemiology of schoolboy rugby injuries</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Athletic injuries - In adolescence</dc:subject>
   <dc:subject>Sports medicine</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Schoolboy rugby injuries are a cause for concern in medical and non-medical circles, but few scientific investigations into their nature and frequency have been undertaken. The majority of reported rugby injury surveys are retrospective, have considered only specific injuries, or have reported only those seen at one location. Also, most studies have not distinguished minor injuries from major injuries. A pilot study conducted at one school in Cape Town during the 1982 rugby season, showed clear patterns of injury related to the age of players, their level of competition, playing position, the stage of the rugby season and the phase of play at the time of injury (Nathan et al. 198 3) . The studies as reported in this thesis were designed as a comprehensive follow-up study. The research methods and definition were similar but a much larger sample was studied and new areas not covered by the pilot study were introduced. During two 18-week seasons, in which approximately 4 700 players from 26 high schools played 6766 rugby matches, 905 players were prevented from participating in rugby for at least one week due to injury. The incidence and nature of injuries occurring to these players were followed in a prospective study and results were analysed for: (i) overall number and incidence of injured players; (ii) age-group and playing level; (iii) time of the season; (iv) phase of play; (v) playing position; (vi) type of injury; (vii) anatomical site; (viii) specific diagnoses; (ix) match vs practice injuries; (x) number of days off rugby; and (xi) medical treatment. The use of correspondence as a survey method resulted in 40 to 50% of injuries not being reported over the two-year period of the study. It appeared that the most accurate method of data collection was direct personal contact between the researcher and the injured player.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The WNT pathway is a major developmental pathway that plays an important role in the development of many tumours, including neuroectodermal and bone tumours. Ewing sarcoma (ES) / primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) shows varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation and is the second commonest bone malignancy in childhood. A recent study on ES cell lines using RT-PCR analysis and biological response assays suggests that an intact WNT pathway exists in ES and that addition of exogenous WNT ligands enhances cell motility. Based on this we hypothesize that the WNT pathway may play a role in the biology of ES/PNET and we aim to investigate this by immunohistochemical stains on archival tissue.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A chronicle of cultural transformation: ethnography of Badagry Ogu musical practices</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Kunnuji, Joseph</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Bruinders, Sylvia</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>Music</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This thesis examines the musical practices of Badagry Ogu people from both historical and contemporary perspectives and provides strategies for their further integration into the changing social and economic landscape characteristic of 21st-century Lagos. Badagry emerged as a Nigerian town bordering the Republic of Benin in the 19th-century colonial delineation processes, which neglected ethnic frontiers. Consequently, Badagry Ogu people, being a minority ethnic group and geographically peripheral in Nigeria, have been politically, economically and socially marginalized for generations. Using ethnographic methods in studying selected indigenous musical bands (Gogoke, Gigoyoyo, Kristitin and Akran Ajogan), a biographical sketch of master drummer Hunpe Hunga, and an applied ethnomusicology method of collaborative music composition and arrangement, I chronicle the musical heritage of Badagry Ogu people. In addition, I suggest an approach for its recontextualisation into different creative economies. I engage Thomas Turino's framework for identity and social analysis, including the concepts of cultural cohorts and cultural formations, in exploring the different attitudes, among Badagry Ogu people, towards indigenous music. I advocate for and outline a contemporary approach for musical recontextualisation as a means of inclusivity and economically empowering performers of indigenous Ogu music in Badagry. This thesis includes my additional arrangements to the studio recordings of Gogoke. The recontextualisation process, which commenced with Gogoke's recording of indigenous instruments and vocals in Badagry Lagos Nigeria, reached its full fruition in the overdubs of Western musical instruments in Cape Town, South Africa. To further explore the theme of inclusivity, I examine current gender practices in Ogu communities evident in the gendered musical practices of contemporary Badagry. With its indepth analysis of Ogu genres, musical instruments, gender issues and a framework for recontextualising African indigenous musics, this thesis, while filling the gap in the study of ethnic minorities in Nigeria, is a significant contribution of the nuanced artistic practices of Badagry Ogu people to African music scholarship.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Introduction: There is a lack of policies and research regarding the disclosure of results in genomic research, especially in South Africa. Challenges remain regarding the disclosure of genomic research results to research participants and their families, which may partly be addressed by considering parental and participants' preferences. This study serves as a sub-study to the NeuroDev study which is performing genotyping and exome sequencing on children with NeuroDevelopmental disorders in the Western Cape; and will investigate a feedback of findings method pertaining to the needs and preferences of the patient community. Aims: To investigate parents' understanding of the genomic research study they are participating in as well as their preferences regarding the feedback process and anticipated contributions of significant genetic findings generated by the NeuroDev study. This study further hopes to inform a tailored feedback policy reflecting the needs of this South African population. Research Design: A pragmatic qualitative approach was used by conducting 12 semi-structured interviews with 17 parents of children participating in the NeuroDev study. Purposive sampling was used, selecting retrospectively from patients recruited for the NeuroDev study in which findings of de novo, significant mutations are more likely expected. Interviews were conducted in English, in a private setting at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH), and were audio-recorded by the researcher; observations and field notes were documented. Generated data was analyzed using thematic analysis to generate themes and transcripts were imported into NVivo 12 to assist with managing and organizing the data for analysis. Ethical approval was been obtained from the University of Cape Town (UCT) (HREC 784/2018). Results: Empiric data collection ran from May to July 2019 and preliminary data was presented at the NeuroDev AGM and on a poster at the SASHG conference, RCWMCH research open day and UCT postgraduate research day. Findings were that the parents of the participants understood the study they were participating in as well as basic concepts of genetics, however, parental understanding over the cause of their child's condition remains a source of confusion when pertaining to their understanding of genetics being ‘passed down the family lineage' and how that integrates with de novo mutations. Furthermore, there is potential for it to impact on feelings of guilt. Parents have a need for information, discovering the cause of their child's condition and to be involved in the research process with full disclosure as events unfold. Altruism seems to be a major motivator for participating in genomics research but personal and family benefit also served to be a key driver in that research results could potentially provide awareness and information regarding their child's condition, the management thereof and recurrence risk in future. Participants in this study want pertinent research results which could offer closure, acceptance and relief, however, differences over the meaning of such results were observed between those whose child already had a diagnosis versus those whose child remained undiagnosed. Furthermore, receiving non-pertinent and negative result was still perceived to be meaningful for some. Further diversity was observed in parental preferences for the explanation of preliminary results. Discussion: Given that non-pertinent results still hold value for participants, consideration should be given as to more extensive ways of communicating this if such results are not to be returned since results are generally viewed as a point of access to information or relating to their child's condition. Diverse preferences regarding when and what participants want to know for results feedback needs to be addressed in order to facilitate a guidance framework for the delivery of genomic research results and can perhaps take the form of a tiered-consent model for feedback of incidental findings. As such, genetic counsellors may have a valuable role to play in facilitating participant satisfaction and bridging the gap between researchers and public expectations. Ethical considerations: Consent was taken before commencement of the study.

   <dc:description>Are species physiologically specialised to the specific climatic conditions in their habitats and can this explain their distributions? This thesis addresses this question using a very specific system: bryophytes on the elevational gradient of Piton des Neiges, Réunion Island. Bryophytes are expected to be specialised to fairly narrow conditions of drought, temperature and insolation, which restrict their geographic range. However, little is known about the mechanisms that connect bryophytes with climatic factors. In this thesis I test the idea of ecophysiological specialisation using reciprocal transplant experiments, along with direct laboratory measurements of species' responses to desiccation and temperature. In these experiments I use species restricted to low, mid or high elevation, as well as widespread species found along most of the gradient. The transplant experiment revealed a trend of upslope survival of restricted species, with species from all sites performing best at their elevation of origin and the site above, and badly at lower elevations. Despite macroclimate being found as an important factor shaping bryophyte range size and distribution, the effect of microhabitat could not be ignored. This was especially true for the widespread species, which showed a strong effect of microhabitat placement in the transplant experiment. Desiccation tolerance was found to increase with elevation in range-restricted species, but widespread species showed little difference in their sensitivity to desiccation, regardless of elevation of origin. Range-restricted species from low elevation were more sensitive to low temperatures and had higher optimum temperatures for photosynthesis than mid- and high-elevation species. Widespread species had narrower ranges of temperature tolerances than range-restricted species, and did not differ in their response to temperature, regardless of elevation of origin. The results of these experiments corresponded well with the climatic conditions that these species habitually experience – with extremes at the gradient peripheries and intermediate conditions in between. This thesis showed that specialisation to both macro- and microclimatic conditions can be attributed as a main driver of bryophyte range size and distribution on the elevational gradient of Piton des Neiges, Réunion Island. This research adds to the body of knowledge on the physiological responses of tropical bryophytes, which is important for species' distribution modelling. Furthermore, it provides insight into the factors that shape bryophyte distribution, critical for biodiversity management under climate change scenarios.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Unsound Minds is a short novel about a young girl, Clara, who has suffered emotional trauma. She arrived in Hindpark Township from a place that she never discloses. She has been living in the loft of a block of flats for a while, isolated from the community, only corning out at night to scrounge for food in the rubbish bins belonging to a restaurant situated opposite the flats. The community believes her to be mentally disturbed and want nothing to do with her. One night, while looking through her window, she witnesses the murder of the restaurateur, Samson. A young police officer, Wanda, is assigned the duty of protecting her from the murderers before they find out that she is a witness. He places her under the care of Matrida, a formidable spinster, who lives a short distance away from the scene of the crime. It is, however, this precautionary act that actually exposes Clara to the killers as a witness. As part of the novel's tapestry, the story explores the workings of the township's corrupt and incompetent police force which is headed by an authoritarian bully, Inspector Bedson. Hindpark's social dynamics, beliefs and superstitions, and sense of community, despite some conflict between residents, play an integral role in creating the sort of environment that Clara finds herself in. Wanda, the only policeman with any notable integrity, starts off as her reluctant protector; Matrida assumes the role of a reluctant mother figure; Anabel is the obnoxious neighbour; and limbo is the neighbourhood's aggressive hell-raiser. Like Clara, they have each experienced some form of trauma in their lives. They become a more dependable unit of protection to Clara than the entire Hindpark police force. Without being scientific or philosophical, Unsound Minds looks at the question of sanity. It is a story about how no one human being is exempt from some form of madness and how that madness drives each individual differently. The supposedly insane Clara is placed in the care of Matrida whom the community believes is herself not completely sane. But even in her madness, she is instrumental in bringing back some stability into Clara's life. At the other extreme, Bedson's madness is destructive. Because of his inept leadership skills, he drives the entire police force into disrepute. Given this human dynamic. the story seeks to reveal how everyone uses their madness in the way that suits them best - for good or for bad. The theme of madness was not planned at the time of beginning this short novel, but developed as the narrative progressed. However, just as writing is subjective, so is reading. I expect each reader to read into Unsound Minds what s/he sees in it. The story is entirely my own, influenced partly by my perceptions of the different environments that I have lived in throughout my life, although it is purely imaginative. Pointers which I received from my supervisor, Professor Geoffrey Haresnape, helped in moulding it into a narrative that will hopefully be a worthwhile read.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Adaptive reuse can be viewed as a catalytic process that upgrades an existing building into its current temporal reality. This process has given rise to the practice of facadism; a practice that operates in the middle ground between two extreme approaches of either preservation or complete destruction of an existing building. Preservation is concerned primarily with the keeping of the existing building in its intact form, architectural language, tectonic and spatial qualities. New programmes demand new spatial needs, the practice of preservation leaves very little space for major intervention to take place, remaining often unsatisfactory for the new uses of the building. On the other hand, the anti-preservationist's approach leads to total disregard of the existing whereby complete demolition is likely to take place. The practice of facadism locates itself in between these two approaches. While it serves its purpose of upgrading the existing architecture, this paradoxical practice is somewhat more deceptive than pristine preservation or complete demolition. The problematic issue is that it pretends to value and retain part of the building while ignoring the set of values of the whole that the existing building has to offer. More importantly, it erases the spatial and programmatic qualities of the existing while only considering the material and physical connection between the old and the new. ln the majority of cases, this results in a severe dismembering and the gut-removal of the existing building's internal elements. The upgrading of an existing building is bound to exert major changes that entirely transform the building's image. This reality is acknowledged and regarded as unavoidable throughout the dissertation. However, when the whole and the set of values of the existing are ignored, the new intervention creates a totally alien architecture that offer no substance that can relate to the existing building. This dissertation set out to find a dialogue between the old and the new, by respecting the old without compromising on the upgrade. The aim of this dissertation covers the process of space-making that relies primarily on taking the valued elements, whether physical, spatial or programmatic from the existing to drive the design of the new intervention forward. Unlike the practice of facadism, where the process emerges from design intentions that do not value the existing, the process employed in this design dissertation frames the existing building as the starting point of the design process. The new intervention therefore originates from the spatial overlay of the existing building, where the latter becomes the main input of the design process for the former. Since the practice of facadism does not value space, the emphasis for the spatial overlay is to find the right fit between maintaining spatial qualities of the existing while juxtaposing the requirements of the new design intervention.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Rehabilitating the Prison System: The prison system in South Africa is a harsh and ineffective system that emphasises the need to punish rather than rehabilitate and reintegrate the incarcerated back into society. Although a lot of prisons in South Africa host a number of workshops and activities which have been introduced to inmates for such purposes- the recidivism rates of offenders, that have ended up in the penal system, has failed to drop or decline. A Process of deconstruction and synthesis: The method of this study is to analyse and deconstruct existing prison or correctional/ penitentiary/ rehabilitation institute landscapes into potential design components and then synthesise these into environments that can promote the rehabilitation of prisoners. The projects analysed are of international and South African origin, and are of prisons or mental and other high-security institutions. The analysed projects will be looked at as potential interventions that can be synthesised within the landscapes (rather, lack of landscapes) of Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town. Looking into redesigning Pollsmoor Prisona prison where conditions do not support opportunities for rehabilitation and integration and where bland, cold concrete and brick facades enclose inmates for mostly 23-hours a day.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This is a theory evaluation of the Touchline Media (TLM) employee induction programme. Organisations use induction training as part of the new employee welcoming process, making it one of the most common types of organisational training programmes (Klein &amp; Weaver, 2000). Employees who have participated in structured induction programmes are 69% more likely to stay with their chosen organisation than compared to employees who did not receive a similar programme (Brodie, 2006). Ideal induction programmes with appropriate content, process, support and follow-up components have universally been shown to improve employee retention and identification. The one-day TLM induction programme is set in a media and magazine production environment that is very fast paced and deadline driven. It was constructed as a means of ensuring that the organisation's legal obligation surrounding employee induction was fulfilled by informing new employees of their specific job requirements, performance standards and company policies. There are three evaluation questions that are addressed in this evaluation: Evaluation question 1: Does the HRM's programme theory work for the recipients? In other words, are they aware that the outcome of the induction programme should be fulfilling a legal obligation? Evaluation question 2: Would the original induction programme lead, by default, to identification with the employer and staff retention? This evaluation question was included, as it was assumed that the programme activities might have unintended consequences like identification and retention. Evaluation question 3: If the original programme theory is changed (based on existing literature regarding induction programmes) would it lead to an improved design and in the end, to a more effective programme? Data was collected from programme participants using a ten item questionnaire. Questionnaire items were included by the evaluators to test three factors (Legal Obligation, Retention and Identification), with responses in a five-point Likert format. No statistically significant differences in the mean scores for Legal Obligation, Retention and Identification for the three groups of programme attendees (Group 1: New employees with first month induction attendance; Group 2: New employees with later induction attendance; Group 3: Long-serving employees with later induction attendance) were found. This is an indication that the TLM induction programme did not lead to the outcomes of Legal Obligation, Retention or Identification. The main suggestions for improvement were presented according to the four universal components that make up a well organised induction programme, namely content, support, follow-up and process (D' Aurizio, 2007).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In the wake of AI Qaeda's attack against the United States on September 11, 2001, Africa has gained strategic significance due to the belief that its weak states are a danger to American national security. US Africa policy is now centered on the logic that weak African governments unable to provide for the basic needs of their people and lacking full control of their borders provide both a breeding ground and safe-haven for terrorist organizations. Africa has thus gone from being a marginalized humanitarian concern in the 1990s, to a continent of strategic significance in the US War on Terror (USW01) in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center, as seen in the fact that American aid to the continent has more than tripled in the years following 9/11. The purpose of this thesis is to critically analyze the political process behind this shift in policy in order to address the question of who was responsible for this change in US Africa policy and how did they make the change happen. This study takes the form of a theoretical case study, using the Copenhagen School's Securitization Theory, designed to identify the means by which an issue is placed on the national security agenda, to address this change in post-9/11 US Africa policy. In accordance with this theoretical framework, primary sources from government and non-government agencies including policy statements, speeches and legislative testimonies are surveyed to identify instances of the claim being articulated that Africa represents a threat to American national security and its legitimation and reiteration by an audience. This study finds that the unified executive branch under the Bush administration and Washington think tanks made the unified claim that the condition of Africa is a threat to US national security and the legislative branch served as the singular audience, legitimating this claim and appropriating dramatically increased and enhanced aid to the continent. The factors of political agency and context are offered as additions to the Securitization Theory framework in this study, and their incorporation in this case determines that the high-level of the agency of the securitizing actors and audience facilitated the legitimation process, as did the use of the contextual factors of the trauma of9/11 and the American identity as promoters of democratic ideals. These additional factors underscore both the political power of the actors involved and the techniques they use to support their claims, thereby developing the political quality of the theory and providing a more complete representation of the securitization process.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation presents a case study of the Zambian government's decision to reintroduce planning in 2002, after having abandoned it a decade prior. African countries, and most developing countries, share similar experiences in development planning - something Chimhowu, Hulme, and Munro refer to as the 'rise, fall, and return of planning'. The authors refer to the most recent period in the history of development planning - which became evident in most emerging countries in the late-2000s or 2010s - as the rise of the 'new' development planning. On a broad level, the catalyst for the reintroduction of planning in Zambia was an aid harmonisation process that saw multilateral and bilateral agencies attempt to streamline aid inflows into recipient countries, reduce the associated administrative costs for local officials, and generally improve aid efficacy. More specifically, the case study finds that a particular confluence of economic ideas and political interests left the government of Levy Mwanawasa favourably disposed to the reintroduction of planning. In this sense, the reintroduction of development planning formed part of Mwanawasa's attempts to shore up his legitimacy among the electorate and to build a political coalition to withstand a powerful faction within his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) led by former president Frederick Chiluba. This paper finds that Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) 2006-2010 - the first development plan to be implemented since planning was abandoned in 1991 - was heavily influenced by the Poverty Reduction and Strategy Paper (PRSP) that preceded it. The PRSP was completed as a condition of the multilateral debt relief programme in which Zambia was participating at the time. Significantly, the FNDP did not represent a return to the developmentalism that characterised the post-independence era of development planning. Rather, the FNDP represented a continuation of the 'neoliberal populism' introduced with the PRSP. In practice, this resulted in failed attempts to alleviate some of the costs of adjustment - such as poverty and unemployment - through increased social sector spending. In short, the rise of the 'new' development planning in Zambia was not accompanied by a corresponding return of any sort of 'new' developmentalism.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In South Africa, there is a burden of unidentified deceased individuals in forensic mortuaries. When human remains are severely compromised, hard tissues may provide the only DNA source for identification. The QIAamp® DNA Investigator Kit is used in forensic laboratories worldwide, including in South Africa, to extract DNA for identification purposes. However, in local forensic casework, the DNA recovered from teeth is often of insufficient quantity and quality for generating a DNA profile. The phenol-chloroform DNA extraction method has demonstrated improved, yet inconsistent results, when used on hard tissues. Therefore, this study assessed DNA recovery from 52 human control teeth from three deceased individuals, using an optimised phenol-chloroform method. This method involved an overnight demineralisation, two additions of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and an ethanol precipitation, as used by the Australian Federal Police. Quantitative PCR (Quantifiler™ Trio DNA Quantification Kit) and DNA profiling (PowerPlex® ESI 16 System) were then used to assess DNA quantity and quality. Results were compared to those obtained from the same teeth but extracted using the QIAamp® DNA Investigator Kit. The phenol-chloroform method recovered DNA with significantly higher yields (p = 0.0454) and significantly less degradation (p &lt; 0.0001). Despite this improvement, there was no significant difference in DNA profiling success. This study also did a preliminary analysis of other factors affecting results and suggested that premolars might be the best tooth type with regards to DNA quantity, quality and profiling. Furthermore, dental disease and jawbone had a significant impact on results from teeth. Lastly, the phenol-chloroform method was applied to six teeth from a marine decomposition case to assess its performance in a local forensic setting. DNA metrics were particularly poor in this casework example, highlighting how different forensic and control environments are and the need for further optimisation. Overall, this study supports the use of the phenol-chloroform method and has provided a preliminary suggestion of the best tooth type, jawbone and tooth condition for DNA analysis for forensic human identification.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>An altered small intestinal permeability has been proposed as an important aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The relevant literature was reviewed. Intestinal permeability to Polyethylene glycol 400 in patients with Crohn' s disease, their relatives and healthy controls was examined and the data compared with studies of small bowel permeability to other similar sized probes. A new technique of analysis of urinary Polythylene Glycol 400 by High Performance Liquid Chromatography was described and compared with a previously established HPLC method. No evidence of an altered bowel permeability could be found using Polyethylene glycol 400, but the possibility that this may have been related to probe size and characteristics can not be excluded .</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Maximising performance of microbial processes, including yeast-based processes, in an industrial setting requires understanding of the impact of process stresses. These may be the result of process configuration, dilution, temperature changes, hydrodynamic conditions or process perturbations. Methods to determine the microbial metabolic response to such stresses have long been sought, but are typically limited, often requiring the use of a suite of methods to assess the physiological status and state. The recent technical advances in microcalorimetry suggest potential for the use of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) to determine yeast viability and vitality and is investigated here. IMC is a laboratory method whereby the real-time heat produced by a chemical, biological or physical process is measured in the micro to nano watt range. It is proposed that this heat production may be correlated to the physiological state of the microbial catalyst and can be used to measure the impact of different stresses. In this study, the potential of IMC as a method for exploring process stress is investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its application in the beer brewing industry as a case study. Here, it is well known that yeast viability and vitality have commercial significance. IMC is sufficiently sensitive to detect the heat given off by 1000 yeast cells. However, IMC cannot distinguish between different heat flows within a system i.e. it is non-specific. The literature demonstrates how IMC has been used in the study of numerous microbiological fields, including the growth and metabolism of yeast. Previous studies have successfully derived the specific growth rate and cell numbers of a growing yeast population from analysing power and heat curves. The specific growth activity and specific growth retardation of yeast and how these parameters relate to bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects has also been examined by a number of authors. The key objectives of this study were to determine the viability and vitality of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using IMC and to assess the impact of stresses on yeast viability and vitality. This was achieved by measuring the thermal power produced by a growing yeast suspension as a function of its overall growth and metabolism. Two industrially relevant stresses were examined: cold shock and ethanol shock. The effect of these stresses has yet to be studied using microcalorimetry. The growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ethanol stress was used as an inhibition study to isolate its effects on the growth thermogram. Following the generation of thermograms under control and stress conditions using IMC, a method for their quantitative analysis was developed. Curves were fitted to the heat data using an exponential growth equation and the time for the heat flow curve to peak was determined. From the exponential curve, the specific growth rate of the yeast was determined with a high degree of repeatability. The coefficient of the exponential term in the growth equation gave highly reproducible and distinguishable results relating to the viability and vitality of the initial yeast population. The time of peak heat flow was also affected by the initial viability and vitality of the yeast and was used to estimate the initial active cell population size.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The Wattled Crane Grus carunculatus is a globally endangered resident of sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1.1, Collar and Stuart 1985). The total population of Wattled Cranes is poorly known and estimates vary widely (Table 1.1). In 1985, Urban (1988) estimated the population at about 13 000 - 15 000 birds, while the IUCN (The World Conservation Union) Red Data Book suggested a total population of only 7 000 (Collar and Stuart 1985). Urban (1996) again estimated the total population at about 13 000 - 15 000 birds, but with a markedly different distribution among range countries. Most recently, regional surveys coordinated by the International Crane Foundation and South African Crane Working Group indicate a total population of aonly about 8 000 birds (R.Beilfuss in litt.).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation focuses on the Voortrekker road strip between Salt River Circle and the Black river. It is bounded by the railway lines on the western side, and the Black River and M5 elevated freeway bridge on the eastern side of the strip. The Voortrekker road bridge over the railway line creates a blatant disconnected neighbourly association. The area is currently in a state of decay, plagued by abandoned buildings and crime. Within this focus area I have highlighted 3 key sites of interest, both for their location adjacent to defining natural and man made boundary elements, as well as their state of neglect and ruin or being underutilized. The urban strategy of this project will attempt to uplift and transform this abandoned area by stitching together the two edges of the strip with a pedestrian orientated, contrasting intervention, that inverts the existing ruin, creating a series of relief spaces within this harsh environment. The architectural intervention would address each ruin by inverting them into public space with individual responses and programs, incorporating predominantly a mixed use transport orientated development with housing and rentable spaces above and retail/ market on ground floor. All the sites will use the same technological and structural approach of a light adaptive socially performing structural frame that connects this disconnected, scarred context. The buried, dark and grungy social &amp; material context is thus resurfaced through this light, uplifting, vertical transition. This architectural transition also carefully uses structure and tactility, with walls that grow out of the existing ruined landscape and protect the site. The social user then inhabits this structure and controls or changes their own space to suit their needs within this new vertical spatial framework.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Genetic and phenotypic characterisation of an Arabidopsis thaliana jasmonic acid signalling mutant, jam2</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant hormone with diverse functions, ranging from development to stress responses. Moreover, a role for JA in mediating defence against pathogen attack has been established, seemingly specific against necrotrophic pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea. Despite these known roles of JA, it is not known exactly how JA activated downstream responses, such as induced gene expression. To further our understanding of JA signalling, this work aimed to identify new components involved in JA signal transduction. A novel screening method based on lack of anthocyanin accumulation after exogenous application of the methyl ester of JA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), was employed. A recessive, monogenic mutant, jasmonic acid modified2 (jam2), was isolated from T-DNA activation tagged lines and characterized genetically and phenotypically. jam2 was found not to be T-DNA tagged as the T-DNA segregates independently of the mutation. jam2 is unlikely to be an anthocyanin biosynthetic mutant but shows delayed anthocyanin accumulation after exogenous MeJA treatment. Resistance to MeJA root growth inhibition is a phenotype shared by all JA insensitive mutants. Contrary to this, jam2, like Col-0, exhibits stunted root growth on MeJA. The expression of the antifungal peptide, PDF1.2 can be induced by exogenous MeJA treatment. To assess how PDF1.2 expression was affected in jam2, plants were treated with external liquid and vaporous MeJA. Interestingly, the PDF1.2 expression pattern after MeJA application (liquid or gaseous) was biphasic for Col-0, jam2 and jar1. However, compared to Col-0 and jar1, jam2 appeared to be affected in the first induction peak upon liquid MeJA treatment, whilst in the second after gaseous treatment. PDF1.2 expression can also be seen as a marker for JA-mediated defence responses. Upon infection with B. cinerea, jam2 and jar1 showed intermediate resistance and faster PDF1.2 expression, compared to Col-0 and coil-1. These findings suggest that jam2 is possibly involved in temporal regulation of anthocyanin accumulation and PDF1.2 expression after MeJA application and B. cinerea infection. Therefore, jam2 may define a novel component within the JA signalling pathway and further genetic and phenotypic characterisation could confirm this.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>An analysis of selected &quot;&quot;cyberpunk&quot;&quot; works by William Gibson, placed in a cultural and socio-political context</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Blatchford, Mathew</dc:creator>
   <dc:subject>English Literature</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This thesis studies William Gibson's &quot;&quot;cyberspace trilogy&quot;&quot; (Neuromancer, Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive). This was an extremely interesting and significant development in 1980s science fiction. It was used to codify and promote the &quot;&quot;cyberpunk&quot;&quot; movement in science fiction at that time, which this thesis also briefly studies. Such a study (at such a relatively late date, given the rapid pace of change in popular culture) seems valuable because a great deal of self-serving and mystifying comment and analysis has served to confuse critical understanding about this movement. It seems clear that cyberpunk was indeed a new development in science fiction (like other developments earlier in the twentieth century) but that the roots of this development were broader than the genre itself. However, much of the real novelty of Gibson's work is only evident through close analysis of the texts and how their apparent ideological message shifts focus with time. This message is inextricably entwined with Gibson's and cyberpunk's technological fantasias. Admittedly, these three texts appear to have been, broadly speaking, representations of a liberal U.S. world-view reflecting Gibson's own apparent beliefs. However, they were also expressions of a kind of technophilia which, while similar to that of much earlier science fiction, possessed its own special dynamic. In many ways this technophilia contradicted or undermined the classical liberalism nominally practiced in the United States. However, the combination of this framework and this dynamic, which appears both apocalyptic and conservative, appears in some ways to have been a reasonably accurate prediction of the future trajectory of the U.S. body politic -- towards exaggerated dependency on machines to resolve the consequences of an ever increasingly paranoid fantasy of the entire world as a threat. (It seems likely that this was also true, if sometimes to a lesser degree, of the cyberpunk movement as a whole.) While Gibson's work was enormously popular (both commercially and critically) in the 1980s and early 1990s, very little of this aspect of his work was taken seriously (except, to a limited degree, by a few Marxist and crypto-Marxist commentators like Darko Suvin). This seems ironic, given the avowedly futurological context of science fiction at this time.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Introduction: Routine viral load (VL) monitoring is important for assessing the effectiveness of ART in South Africa. There is little information however, on how the longitudinal VL patterns change for subgroups of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) who have experienced at least one elevated VL. We investigated the possible longitudinal VL patterns that may exist among this unique population. Methods: This mini-dissertation offers three components; a research protocol (Section A), a literature review (Section B) and a journal ready manuscript (Section C). We examined HIV VL data for the Western Cape from 2008 to 2018, taken from the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS). Using&lt; 1000 copies/mL as a threshold for viral suppression, we identified 109092 individuals who had at least one instance of an elevated VL. A nonparametric (KML-Shape) and a model-based (LCMM) clustering technique were used to identify latent subgroups of longitudinal VL trajectories among these individuals. Results: Both the KML-Shape and LCMM clustering techniques identified five latent viral load trajectory subgroups. KML-Shape found majority of individuals' trajectories belonged to clusters that had a decreasing longitudinal VL trend (76.6% of individuals), while LCMM found a smaller proportion of individuals' trajectories belonged to clusters that had a decreasing longitudinal trend (52.5% of individuals). Most of the trajectory subgroups identified had long periods of low-level viremia. Conclusion: Although majority of individuals belonged to clusters that had downward trends, further research is needed to better understand factors contributing to membership of clusters that did not have a downward longitudinal trend. Understanding these factors may help in the development of targeted HIV prevention programs for these individuals.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>It has been shown that black students are generally not finding the academic success in South African universities that would confirm a truly equitable educational system. In response to this, universities in South Africa have taken several different measures to bridge this gap and provide the support needed for these students to thrive through various programmes that provide supplementary support and extended degree programmes to educationally disadvantaged students.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In this study, we proposed to retain AAL2 and lay it over IP (AAL2IIP). The IP-based lub interface is therefore designed to tunnel AAL2 channels from the Node B to the RNC. Currently IP routes packets based on best-effort which does not guarantee QoS, To provide QoS, MPLS integrated with DiffServ is proposed to support different QoS levels to different classes of service and fast forward the IP packets within the lub interface. To evaluate the performance of AAL2!IP in the Iub interface, a test-bed was created.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Exploring gated eco-developments - contributing towards urban performance and sustainability: a case study of Chapman's Bay Estate, Noordhoek, Cape Town</dc:title>

   <dc:description>South African cities maintain an apartheid legacy through their spatial layout, which is characterised by sprawl, fragmentation and separation. These characteristics have devastating implications for spatial justice, which cannot be isolated from urban performance and sustainability. Yet, the proliferation of gated developments and eco-estates is becoming an increasingly popular form of development both internationally and within South Africa. Often the sustainability debate allows for the glossing over of issues of social justice. These exclusive enclaves act as a microcosm for broader issues of social polarization and ecological fragmentation. This dissertation explores the complexities of this radical urban form and its implications for urban performance and sustainability. Through an understanding of the drivers and consequences of gating, it explores the conflict in which planners often find themselves: between the ideals of an integrated, accessible city and the contextual realities. This study of gated developments has been founded upon a theoretical debate as well as a case study analysis of Chapman's Bay Estate in Noordhoek, Cape Town, South Africa. This included a spatial and legislative analysis of the CoCT's Gated Development Policy as well as relevant spatial plans, through the lens of Chapman's Bay Estate. The research has revealed the perpetuating nature of gated developments in the urban realm. Furthermore, it has exposed gaps between the visions, goals and objectives of planning and the outcomes in practise. Additionally, it has revealed fragmentation between policies, plans and built environment professionals. Through this dissertation, I seek add to the current debate regarding gated developments and their implication on urban form. Furthermore, I address these findings through a review of the City of Cape Town's Gated Development Policy, as well as the harmonization and integration of relevant policies and plans.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Mobile phones</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The phenomenon of rapid increment of the mobile phones can be utilized through supporting patients, such as those who have tuberculosis, for treatment adherence. This utilization will enable these patients to directly communicate their needs and requirements or receive health information such as reminder messages from healthcare facilities. However, the current mobile interventions, such as text messaging and speech reminder systems have limited use for people with low literacy levels. To overcome these challenges, this study proposed that the mobile graphic-based reminders be used to support tuberculosis patients to improve compliance with treatment regimens, especially for semi-literate and illiterate patients. A review of the literature and initial investigation study were carried out. The findings from the review were useful in understanding both the current practice of tuberculosis treatment regimens and the patients' needs and requirements. These findings, in addition, were referred in the choices of the components of the mobile graphic-based reminders to be implemented. A visual aid for communication theory was applied to the design and development of graphic-based reminder prototypes. An application prototype was implemented for the Android platform. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of an application prototype in supporting tuberculosis treatment. To measure the effect, the recovery rate was measured based on the effect of: (1) the graphic-based reminder group versus the control group; and (2) the graphic-based reminder group versus the speech-based reminder group. Data was collected using application event logs, interviews, field notes and audio recordings. It was found that treatment adherence of patients in the graphic-based group was higher than in the speech-based or in the control groups. It was further noted that the number of reminder responses in the graphic-based group was higher than in the speech-based group. Additionally, it was observed that patients in the graphic-based group responded sooner after receiving reminder messages compared to those in the speech-based group. The qualitative feedback also indicated that most patients not only found graphic-based reminders more useful to supporting their treatment than speech-based reminders and traditional care but believed that the application met their needs. This study provides empirical evidence that graphic-based reminders, designed for and based on patients' needs and requirements, can support the treatment of tuberculosis for patients of all literacy levels.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Scoring functions seek to compute in different ways protein-ligand binding energies by summing together the individual pairwise atomic interaction energies observed in crystal structures between the protein and the bound ligand. To date though, accurate prediction remains a big challenge since existing scoring functions fail to reproduce known binding energies with a sufficient degree of accuracy and robustness. To overcome this problem, we assign a discrete weighting to the individual atomic interaction to account for entropic desolvation factors on ligand binding. We thereafter re-compute the revised scoring function and test the output against multiple sets of data to examine the robustness of the heuristic weightings used.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Future LIS education and evolving global competency requirements for the digital information environment: an epistemological overview</dc:title>

   <dc:description>In the context of an evolving digitally-oriented library and/or information science (LIS) discipline and framed by Andrew Abbott’s (2001) Chaos of Disciplines theory, this paper presents an epistemological overview of evolving competency requirements for a global digital information environment and the implications of this for future LIS education. In doing so it draws from i) an international case study of ongoing research by the IFLA BSLISE (Building Strong LIS Education) Working Group into the development of an international framework for the assessment of quality standards in LIS education, and ii) a national (South African) case study involving the compilation of a LIS competency index in a highly digitally-oriented information environment.  The Chaos of Disciplines theory was originally conceptualized to demonstrate the evolution of disciplines in the social sciences. Its core principals of The Interstitial Character of a Discipline and Fractal Distinctions in Time are employed as a heuristic tool to connect the empirical evidence from these two purposively selected case studies to the inherent nature of the LIS discipline and the implications of this for i) competency requirements for professional practice in a highly digitized global information environment, and ii) future LIS education responding to these competency exigencies.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Spatial implications of foreign direct investment (FDI) on infrastructure delivery: A case of the City of Lusaka, Zambia</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>City and Regional Planning</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>The is a strong belief that FDI offers possibilities towards a development that has eluded developing countries for decades. It has become a predominant feature in development policy. The influence towards this orientation to development emanates from geopolitical dynamisms that have revolutionized global production systems at the hands of globalization. Innovations in urban economic development strategies concentrate on integrating local economies into the global market through the provision of infrastructure as the operative of global capital inflows. It is argued, however, that to exploit the full benefits of FDI, not only should the country attract the appropriate kind of investment, but its investment policy should be consistent in its interaction and engagements with the overall country's development policy regimes. Appropriateness in this argument entails that, with infrastructure identified as the primary requirement for attracting FDI, it is not only a question of being able to link the provision of infrastructure to attract investment but understanding the social-technical nature of infrastructure and its overall spatial manifestation as a function of urban form and structure. It is the spatial character underlying urban production systems, which development strategies such as FDI need to appropriately understand because it is at that interface were FDI-economic growth argument translate into economic development. Using a formulated conceptual framework based on Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theorization, the study assessed the spatial impacts of the FDI on infrastructure in the City of Lusaka in Zambia. It identified key institutions at the fulcrum of investment promotion and spatial development planning with a focus on planning and provision of network infrastructure. It also reviewed the main policies and legislation driving the FDI-led development agenda. The findings point out that national government priorities at significantly focused on the provision of infrastructure, however, on a very selective and narrow perspective. Infrastructure provision priority is in what is termed as 'economic infrastructure' argued to be the missing element in attracting FDI. What was also discovered, which in a way explains how infrastructure provision is narrowly considered, is a fragmented institutional framework resulting from inadequate legislation. The inadequacies lack of recognition of the spatial embeddedness of investment in the legislation resulting in disconnection between investment strategies formulation and spatial development planning. The overarching conclusion from the study is that to actualize the benefits of FDI substantially, the framework of regimes at the core of advancing the development goal driven by infrastructure, needs to understand the socio-technical nature of network infrastructure. A purely economic consideration of infrastructure as was discovered in the study, significantly limits FDI's contributive value to development.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Mental health is fundamental to a person's wellbeing and quality of life, as well as, influences social and economic outcomes across an individual's lifespan (Barry, Clarke, Jenkins, &amp;amp; Patel, 2013). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as a “state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community” (WHO, 2018). Mental health is considered integral to a person's overall wellbeing and can be determined by a variety of factors such as socioeconomic, environmental and biological (WHO, 2018). Mental health disorders are considered one of the most common causes of disability worldwide, thus resulting in the disease burden of mental illness being an important public health concern (ODPHP, 2019). Mental illness refers to all diagnoseable mental disorders and conditions, which result in significant emotional, social and behavioural changes that cause distress and hamper the individual's ability to function in everyday life (Pareketh, 2018).</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Does support for democracy matter? : a cross-national study of regime preferences and system change</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Using survey data from the third World Values Survey and democracy scores from Freedom House, I outline and test a supply and demand model of democratic change and stability. While &quot;support for democracy&quot; is a common concept in political science, the only empirical studies of the relationship between these regime preferences and democracy (Inglehart, 2003; Inglehart &amp; Welzel, 2003; Welzel, Inglehart and Klingemann 2003) do not control for reciprocal causation and use poorly conceptualised and measured variables. They claim that deeply-rooted cultural orientations called &quot;self-expression values&quot; are a better measure of implicit support for democracy than overt expressions of regime preference. However, I find that once I control for the possibility that democracy is exogenous, there is little difference between the explanatory power of cultural values versus overtly expressed preferences. Furthermore, I argue that popular regime preferences (or demand) affect the change in the level of democracy, but do so only in relation to its current supply. &quot;Net demand&quot; is the driver of system change rather than absolute levels of popular support for democracy.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>The Laccase from Micromonospora sp.044 30-1 as a biocatalyst for synthesis of antioxidant compounds</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are blue multicopper oxidases that catalyse a single electron oxidation of various phenolic substrates with an associated four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. The varied uses of laccase as a biocatalyst can be attributed to its ability to produce a free radical from a suitable substrate. Of importance to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and industrial sectors, are the laccase-catalysed reactions providing means for the synthesis of dimeric phenolics showing biological activity, including antioxidant activity. The objective of this research was to investigate the production of value-added compounds, with biological activity, via laccase-catalysed oxidation reactions. Our laboratory has access to several unique and previously unexploited culture collections obtained from extreme environments spanning the globe. Potentially novel strains were screened for the ability to produce laccases: 14 environmental isolates, of which 2 strains were fungi, 7 were streptomycetes, and 5 were non-streptomycetes, representing the rare actinomycete genera Gordonia, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Amycolatopsis, and Micromonospora were screened. This is the first report of laccase production in these species. A screening protocol, using criteria specifically suited to bioprocess development, was developed to investigate variables affecting the production of laccase by the native strains. Variables investigated included different types of media (nutritional variables), pH, temperature, incubation times, aeration and agitation, salt concentrations, and the effect of inducers on laccase production by the native strains. Of the isolates investigated, actinomycete strain Micromonospora sp. 044 30-1 showed the greatest potential for the production of laccase. This strain may be novel and the role of laccase in this strain may be related to sporulation. Various growth requirements were investigated in order to optimise for maximal laccase production by strain 044 30-1. The optimal medium for laccase production was M172F medium, pH 5, supplemented with a high concentration of Cu2+ (8 mM), and 2.0% sodium chloride. Extracellular laccase production was higher than intracellular laccase production. The successful application of a Micromonospora strain in an airlift bioreactor specifically for the synthesis of laccase was demonstrated. The biocatalytic potential of the laccase from Micromonospora sp. 044 30-1 was investigated. Laccases are responsible for the formation of radicals that can react non-enzymatically with each other to form dimers or oligomers linked by C-C or C-O bonds. This study reports on laccasecatalysed oxidative reactions involving, primarily, tyrosol, monoacetyltyrosol, and to a lesser extent, reactions with totarol, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and 8-hydroxyquinoline. This study reports for the first time the isolation and structure determination of novel biocatalysis reaction products, specifically the dimeric products obtained through biocatalytic reaction of monoacetyltyrosol with Trametes versicolor laccase, and Micromonospora sp. 044 30-1 laccase. The biocatalysis reaction products of the laccase-catalysed oxidation of tyrosol and monoacetylated tyrosol showed higher antioxidant activity than the parent compounds, as determined by the 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) assays, showing that the dimeric derivatives of laccase-catalysed reactions with phenolic compounds have enhanced antioxidant capabilities. The biocatalysis products were also evaluated as antimicrobials and showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, a vancomycin resistant clinical strain of Enterococcus faecium, a clinically relevant strain of Micrococcus, and Mycobacterium aurum, a strain that displays a similar antibiotic susceptibility profile to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the prevalent disease tuberculosis.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Nothing can exist, live, survive or thrive without water. Water is the basis of life for all living organisms and the centre of life for all societies. The global attitude around water has become territorial as it encompasses an intricate link to the development of nations. Centralising main water supplies beyond urban boundaries may have improved the utilisation of water but has also resulted in the separation of society and water. Water is what gave rise to the city of Cape Town, as there was an abundance of rivers and springs located on and around Table Mountain. This water was first used by the Khoi people and became the reason for colonial settlers residing in the Cape. The City is currently experiencing the worst water crisis in over a century due to increased temperatures and decreased rainfall. Amid the water crisis there appears to be underused, freshwater below Cape Town's CBD, flowing to the Atlantic Ocean via the stormwater reticulation system. This water originates from Table Mountain's rivers, streams and, to an extent, springs. Naturally, the drought has sparked widespread concern for, and attention given to, water and its sustainable usage. This dissertation explores the ways in which the City's water, environmental and spatial planning policies could spark a new and improved water-culture within Cape Town to ensure sustainable, long-term water availability. This is done through investigating the potential of Oranjezicht in becoming a catalytic area for water sustainability due to the locations of the Field of Springs and the Platteklip Stream. This dissertation proposes using water sensitive urban design as well as integrated, collaborative partnerships and management mechanisms to encourage an improved urban water culture.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The goal of this thesis project was to design, build and test a 500 kVA-hybrid power factor/current unbalance correction unit. The unit will be used to reduce the maximum demand and reactive power consumption through power factor correction of large electricity users as well as minimize power disruption and improve power quality through unbalance correction. Through literature research, it was discovered that a particular combination of delta and wye connected capacitors exist for a particular unbalanced load that result in a reduction of unbalance (given enough load inductiance). Simulation of the proposed compensator topology allowed for the verification of this and and appropriate control strategy could be developed. Simulations also revealed the average portion of available capacitors that would be required for each of the delta and wye connected filters.</dc:description>

   <dc:subject>Programme Evaluation</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This dissertation examines the City of Cape Town municipality's Waste Wise Programme. It examines one of the three models, namely the Sustainable Education and School Recycling model and consists of a theory as well as a process evaluation. On commencement of the theory evaluation, the evaluator investigated the plausibility of the programme theory. In order to extract this information, a literature review on international and local literature was completed to answer the evaluation questions. The literature review suggests that the programme theory is plausible but that it could be further enhanced by incorporating a few additions to the programme. It investigated the Waste Wise Programme's impact theory, the service utilisation and the organisational plans, and found that, with a few minor amendments, the beneficiaries of the programme may benefit more.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Objective: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been found to exhibit emotional regulation difficulties. However, much remains to be learned about the specific neural mechanisms that underlie such difficulties. This study aimed to use eye tracking to investigate the mechanisms underlying emotional regulation difficulties in individuals with PTSD. Method: A total of 87 trauma-exposed mothers (34 PTSD positive and 53 non-PTSD controls) completed an eye tracking assessment in which pupillary dilation in response to emotionally valenced stimuli was measured. The participants also completed two self-report measures of emotional regulation. Results: The PTSD group exhibited increased pupillary dilation to positively valenced stimuli compared to the trauma-exposed, non-PTSD group. In contrast, there was no difference between the two groups using self-report measures of emotional regulation. Additionally, there were no associations between self-report measures and pupillary response to emotionally valenced stimuli. Conclusion: The findings may reflect impaired parasympathetic nervous system processes in individuals with PTSD. The finding that eye tracking, but not emotional regulation questionnaires, differentiated the groups may reflect the point that self-report measures are biased by an individual's ability and willingness to respond. These findings need to be followed up with additional experiments to delineate parasympathetic and other mechanisms involved in underpinning emotional regulation difficulties in PTSD.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This mini-dissertation explores the effects of the growth of English as an international and an intranational lingua franca with a focus on the South African debate about language and socio-economic empowerment. This exploration is carried out through an extended review of some of the theories that have challenged the notion that the spread of English is empowering for the majority of the world's population. I refer to these theories as the &quot;critical discourse&quot; about the power of English and argue that within this discourse there is a tendency to be exceedingly dismissive of the idea that the spread of English can in any way empower native speakers of other languages. I refer to this tendency as the &quot;critical model&quot; for looking at the power of English and analyze three metaphors that are often used as tropes to exclude from the &quot;critical discourse&quot; arguments that can be made for using English as a weapon of empowerment. These metaphors characterize English as a &quot;linguistic poacher&quot; that threatens endangered language species with extinction, as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; that excludes the masses from socio-economic mobility, and as a &quot;colonizer of the mind,&quot; or a mechanism that imposes Western-centric values. I argue that while it is important to be aware of these negative effects, the critics of English should not rely too heavily on negative constructions of this language, lest they create theories that are marred by epistemological fallacies that have negative pedagogical and political consequences. Epistemologically, sealing the border of a discourse can lead to tautological arguments that rely excessively on determinism and essentialism. Pedagogically, being exceedingly critical of the power of English can create obstacles in finding ways to teach this language effectively.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Crop models (CMs) can be a key component in addressing issues of global food security as they can be used to monitor and improve crop production. Regardless of their wide utilization, the employment of these models, particularly in isolated and rural areas, is often limited by the lack of reliable input data. This data scarcity increases uncertainties in model outputs. Nevertheless, some of these uncertainties can be mitigated by integrating remotely sensed data into the CMs. As such, increasing efforts are being made globally to integrate remotely sensed data into CMs to improve their overall performance and use. However, very few such studies have been done in South Africa. Therefore, this research assesses how well a crop model assimilated with remotely sensed data compares with a model calibrated with actual ground data (Maize_control). Ultimately leading to improved local cropping systems knowledge and the capacity to use CMs. As such, the study calibrated the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model using two generic soils (i.e. heavy clay soil and medium sandy soil) which were selected based on literature, to measure soil moisture from 1985 to 2015 in Bloemfontein. Using the data assimilation approach, the model's soil parameters were then adjusted based on remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) observations. The observed improvement was mainly assessed through the lens of SM simulations from the original generic set up to the final remotely sensed informed soil profile set up. The study also gave some measure of comparison with Maize_control and finally explored the impacts of this specific SM improvement on evapotranspiration (ET) and maize yield. The result shows that when compared to the observed data, assimilating remotely sensed data with the model significantly improved the mean simulation of SM while maintaining the representation of its variability. The improved SM, as a result of assimilation of remotely sensed data, closely compares with the Maize_control in terms of mean but there was no improvement in terms of variability. Data assimilation also improved the mean and variability of ET simulation when compared that of Maize_control, but only with heavy clay soil. However, maize yield was not improved in comparison. This confirms that these outputs were influenced by other factors aside from SM or the soil profile parameters. It was concluded that remote sensing data can be used to bias correct model inputs, thus improve certain model outputs.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Optimisation of complex distillation colomn systems using rigorous models</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Since distillation is still the most widely used separation technique used in the petrochemical industry, optimisation of these unit operations are important to minimise costs and maximise production. This thesis focuses on the development of a tool using rigorous non-equilibrium distillation models to optimise complex columns. Non-equilibrium distillation models are usually avoided in optimisation studies due to the time required to solve them, but this has been overcome by using a technique called orthogonal collocation in which the profiles in the columns are represented by polynomials of a lower order than would be required normally. This significantly reduces the process times and makes the use of non-equilibrium models a possibility in optimisation studies. The orthogonal collocation technique was applied to a packed distillation column model and shown to be effective in modelling the system. A system consisting of a distillation column with integrated external side reactors was chosen as a case study to investigate the use of the methods. These systems have been shown to be effective in certain circumstances in literature, when comparing them to other forms of process intensification, such as reactive distillation. The toluene disproportionation reaction was considered as a potential use for the technology and the optimisation tool was used to find optimum system configurations for achieving maximum toluene conversions and minimum costs. Nonlinear programming techniques were used initially to optimise these systems, but due to the discontinuities associated with multiple side streams, they were replaced by a genetic algorithm. Various system configurations were identified as achieving maximum conversions and minimum costs. These results were used in a comparison with results obtained from a literature study and the results showed significant promise. Unfortunately, the two studies did not have enough in common to truly produce a comprehensive result. This iv lead to further comparisons with another system using the same information. The results obtained in the toluene disproportionation case study showed that there was some possible benefits for using the side reactor systems, but the conventional system was still 30 and 60% cheaper in terms of capital and utility costs respectively. Another case study was investigated that looked at the synthesis of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol. The packed collocation model was used as a comparison with another investigation performed in literature (using equilibrium distillation models). Both showed comparable results, but still had significant differences. Costs were also compared between the side reactor system and a more conventional system for methyl acetate synthesis. The side reactor systems were found to be more cost effective than the conventional system. Additionally, an increase in the number of external reactors resulted in lower utility costs (mainly as a result of lower flow rates in the side streams). Overall, the reaction and process conditions are important considerations when deciding whether or not to use a side reactor system. For the gas phase toluene disproportionation reaction, the side reactor systems were not cost effective, when compared to the conventional system. However, the liquid phase methyl acetate reaction proved to be more conducive to side reactor systems in terms of cost. This thesis has shown the applicability of using rigorous disequilibrium distillation models in optimisation studies.

   <dc:description>This study explores whether social policy responses for orphans and vulnerable children(OVC)  in Botswana address the needs of this category of children. The objectives of social policies and legislation (such as the Constitution, the Children's Act of 2009, the National Guidelines on the Care of OVC of 2008, and the Botswana National Plan of Action for OVC of 2010-2016) in relation to social protection are analysed, and the availability, accessibility and adequacy of the HIV and AIDS social protection measures for OVC, namely prevention of mother-to-child transmission, antiretroviral therapy, and community home-based care and orphan food baskets, are described. The study argues that these social policy responses for OVC are inadequate and do not comprehensively meet the needs of OVC. There is an inadequate legal and policy framework, fragmentation of social protection provisions, inadequate minimum eligibility criteria, shortage of human resources, insufficient funding, lack of awareness, and the presence of stigma and discrimination. These present barriers to the availability, accessibility and adequacy of social protection provision to OVC.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Phosphate precipitation as struvite from municipality wastewater</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Tshwane Municipality produces approximately 4Ml/day of dewatering liquors arising from municipal sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. The sludge being dewatered is a combination of an anaerobically digested primary sludge and an undigested waste activated sludge. High phosphate and nitrogen are released into water during the anaerobic treatment process. High concentrations of these nutrients in the wastewater lead to eutrophication, which is a major environmental problem (Doyle et al., 2000). In view of the above problem, the aim of this project was to investigate the feasibility of precipitating phosphate in the form of struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) from the Tshwane Municipality dewatering liquors and consequently recovering it as a valuable and marketable product. The project was investigated in three sequential stages consisting of: 1. An aqueous thermodynamic modelling study using OLI Systems Inc. Stream Analyser Version 2.0.57 to determine the precipitation conditions required for the removal of phosphates in the dewatering liquor. 2. Bench'scale laboratory experiments to investigate the feasibility of phosphate precipitation as struvite under different pH conditions, Mg: P molar ratios and Ca:P molar ratios. 3. Fluidised bed experiments to establish the characteristics of phosphate removal at varying levels of supersaturation. The results suggest that the pH of the system has a significant effect on phosphate removal due to its influence on the availability of PO4 3, NH4 + and Mg2+. According to the thermodynamic modelling results, phosphates are removed as Ca3(PO4)2 and Mg3(PO4)2.8H2O. Removal of phosphate as Mg3(PO4)2.8H2O starts at a pH above 7 with the maximum removal achieved at pH 10. Thereafter, phosphate removal as Mg3(PO4)3.8H2O drops to zero due to Mg(OH)2 precipitation being favoured at the higher pH values. Thermodynamic modelling shows that a high NH4 +:P molar ratio is required to induce struvite precipitation. For sample C1, which had a PO4 P and an NH4 + concentrations of 145mg/L and 65mg/L respectively, the bench scale experiments showed that approximately 30%, 80% and 92% of the phosphate was removed at pH 8, pH 9 and pH 10, respectively. The NH4 +:P molar ratio in ii the precipitate decreased to zero at pH 10 because NH3 formation is favoured at this pH. The XRD analysis showed that the precipitate was Mg3(PO)2.22H2O. On the other hand, it was shown that phosphate was removed as struvite, for sample C2, which had PO4 P and NH4 + concentrations of 93mg/L and 57 mg/L, respectively. The NH4 +: P molar ratio of sample C1 was 0.99 while the NH4 +: P molar ratio of sample C2 was 1.35. However, it was shown that phosphate was removed as Mg3(PO)2.22H2O under pH 10 conditions. Thus, high NH4 +: P molar ratios (i.e. 1.35) in the waste water favours struvite precipitation with the optimum pH level for phosphate removal as struvite being pH 9. Bench scale experiments showed that, amorphous calcium phosphate precipitation is favoured over struvite precipitation at high Ca:P molar ratios. At a Ca:P molar ratio of 0.85:1, it was shown that no struvite was formed. The bench scale experiments showed that the phosphate conversion increased at high Mg:P molar ratios. However, the effect of increasing Mg:P molar ratio on phosphate conversion was significant at pH 9. While at pH 10 there was insignificant increase of phosphate conversion as Mg:P molar ratio was increased probably due to formation of MgOH+ ions at high pH levels. It was shown that high Mg:P molar ratios slightly limits calcium conversion. The calcium conversion was reduced by approximately 10% when Mg: P was increased from 1:1 to 1.4:1 for systems operated at pH 9 and pH 10 conditions. The supersaturation ratio of amorphous calcium phosphate is 104 greater than the magnesium compounds (i.e. struvite and Mg3(PO4)2.22H2O) supersaturation ratio as a result the effect of increasing Mg:P on calcium conversion was relatively very small. The fluidized bed reactor experiments showed that high Mg:P molar ratios increased the phosphate removal as a result of the increased free Mg2+ concentration. However, the high Mg:P molar ratios resulted in an increased supersaturation which led to the formation of many fine particles. There was an increase in overall conversion from 68% to 83 % when the Mg:P molar ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1.2:1. On the other hand, the removal decreased from 45% to 38% when the Mg:P molar ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1.2:1. Moreover, struvite with high purity was produced at a high Mg:P molar ratios (i.e. Mg:P =1.2). Fluidized bed reactor experiments showed that as the recycle ratio was increased the PO4 P conversion also increased. Thus, large amount of struvite particles were recycled to the fluidized bed reactor. As a result, struvite particles provide favourable nucleation sites for struvite precipitation hence high conversion were achieved at higher recycle ratio.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Mineral processing involves liberation and beneficiation operations. Several beneficiation processes exist and one such important process is froth flotation. The flotation process involves the transportation of valuable minerals of a hydrophobic nature into the froth and to the concentrate launder. This hydrophobicity may be natural or imparted by a collector. Froth structure is significant in determining the froth stability which has an effect on the grade and recovery of valuable minerals. The froth structure is dependent on amongst other factors the type of frothers used during the separation process. As a result, frother type and concentration can be used to manipulate the froth recovery and grade of valuable mineral recovered. Upper Group 2 (UG2) ore contains chromite minerals which are naturally hydrophilic. The chromite minerals are usually recovered in the concentrate mainly due to entrainment. This lowers the grade of valuable minerals recovered and poses detrimental effects to downstream operations. Thus, the froth structure plays an important role in the flotation performance of UG2 ore. This project was aimed at investigating the effect of chain length and functional group of different frothers on the froth stability, froth recovery and entrainment. Froth recovery, entrainment, solids and water recovery, as well as metallurgical recovery, were measured in a laboratory scale continuous column flotation cell. Froth stability was measured in a froth stability column, which is a non-overflowing column in which froth rise rate and equilibrium height were measured. A series of increasing molecular weight polyglycol and alcohol frothers, and their blends, were used to investigate the effect of frother type on froth structure.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>In this thesis, we introduce a novel class of many-body quantum system, which we term ‘quantum small worlds'. These are strongly-interacting systems that interpolate between completely ordered (nearest-neighbour, next-to-nearest-neighbour etc.) and completely random interactions. They are systems of quantum spin particles in which the network topology is given by the Watts-Strogatz model of network theory. As such, they furnish a novel laboratory for studying quantum systems transitioning between integrable and non-integrable behaviour. Our motivation is to understand how the dynamics of the system are affected by this transition, particularly with regards to the ability of the system to scramble (quantum) information, and potential emergence of chaotic behaviour. Our work begins with a review of the relevant literature regarding algebraic graph theory and quantum chaos. Next, we introduce the model by starting from a well understood integrable system, a spin- 1 2 Heisenberg, or Ising, chain. We then inject a small number of long-range interactions and study its ability to scramble quantum information using two primary devices: the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) and the spectral form factor (SFF). We find that the system shows increasingly rapid scrambling as its interactions become progressively more random, with no evidence of quantum chaos as diagnosed by either of these devices.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This dissertation presents the design of the RF front end for use on the NeXtRAD radar system. The system is intended for research purposes to investigate potential target detection benefits to be derived from a multistatic, dual-band (X- and L-band), polarimetric radar architecture, particularly within dense clutter environments such as the maritime environment. By examining the high-level system requirements and objectives, requirement specifications for the RF front end were derived and a suitable architecture, making use of commercial off-the-shelf components, proposed. This architecture was modified in order to meet cost constraints  -  subsequently offering reduced levels of functionality but suitable for an initial build. Using this modified RF front end architecture, design verification and system analysis was conducted, both analytically and with the aid of SystemVue, in order to predict both the front end and overall radar detection performance. Once the front end design was found to be satisfactory, it was built and tested in a laboratory environment. Test results revealed a general improvement in performance when compared with the design predictions, yielding peak transmitter power levels in excess of 61dBm at L-band, and 54dBm at X-band. Some non-conformances were also identified, but these were as a result of component problems and not system design. Since the front end could not yet be integrated into the radar, performance modelling was repeated using the final lab test results. This indicated a negligible improvement in receiver single-pulse signal-to-noise ratio, but confirmed that the system performed as predicted. Based on the lab test results, it was concluded that the 'as-built' front end design closely matched the design goals and would be suitable for eventual integration into the first revision of the NeXtRAD system. It was, however, recommended that a concerted effort be made to secure funding to implement the original front end architecture in order to achieve the full system functionality originally desired.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>My body of work is concerned with the constructed promise of telecommunication - that is, the promise to connect people all over the world via telephone lines, computer networks and, most recently, satellite signals. The development of and access to networked systems has brought about this &quot;utopian promise&quot; (Mitchell 2005: 305), an ideal of instant connectivity that allows a user to be in contact with others through technological devices over vast distances. Connectivity supposedly enables users to develop and sustain relationships on the Internet. However, the question arises whether telecommunication technologies are living up to their promise. My title, Reprocessing Inte/ference: An artistic exploration of the visual material generated by inte/terence, refers to the concepts pertaining to this promise and also to the failure of the promise, focusing on the notions of distance and interference. It further encapsulates my working method, a process of degrading and filtering both my own and found footage.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>There is an increasing number of entrepreneurship initiatives that aim to address extreme poverty, but we know little about how they shape founder identity and how diverse identities shape behavior. Although founder identity is a burgeoning field of study, theory is based primarily on research in developed country contexts. We know little about how founder identities emerge and change, and this gap is pronounced with respect to contexts of extreme poverty. I therefore explore how founder identities emerge and change in contexts of extreme poverty with a longitudinal study in a pastoralist community in Northern Kenya, where business itself is nascent, and impoverished pastoralists are in the early stages of learning basic business concepts. I conduct an inductive, qualitative study of 51 pastoralists over three years. Applying both social identity theory and identity theory lenses, this study identifies extant social and role identities that shape what it means to be a founder, as well as new identities introduced through business education and exposure, which conflict with extant identities. I identify three types of founder identity and develop a model illustrating the process through which they emerge based on varied responses to the identity conflict. Founders either maintain emphasis on extant identities, balance emphasis between some extant identities and some new identities, or transform to emphasize new identities, thus shaping who they become as a founder. When founders deviate from external expectations associated with extant identities, they engage in various forms of external identity work to increase acceptance of new behaviors and expectations and change perceptions of who they are as a founder. I further demonstrate that who one becomes as a founder is regulated by the degree of internalization and importance of extant identities that become part of what it means to be a founder in addition to other social identities held by the founder. My findings contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty by providing a more nuanced conceptualization of founder identity in these contexts, including identification of three types of founder identity. I also contribute to both the literature on entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty and founder identity theory more broadly by explaining the process through which founder identities emerge, introducing regulating identities as an explanation for variance in founder identity change, and bringing external identity work to the fore as a key process in founder identity construction and change. My findings also highlight the importance of applying an identity lens to the study of entrepreneurship initiatives in contexts of extreme poverty. I outline future research directions, as well as practical implications for organizations that aim to stimulate and develop entrepreneurship in contexts of extreme poverty through education and access to resources.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Health ﬁnancing reforms, especially those aimed at improving equity, are prone to opposition. Those driving health reforms frequently ﬁnd themselves pitted against vested interests. The thesis explores how best a reform driver might manage other actors in the reform process to achieve key goals. This involves creating and testing a conceptual framework. A review of the international health care reform literature identiﬁes key gaps in knowledge. Additional bodies of theory, mainly from economics, are selected for review on the basis of their potential insight into relationships between reform drivers and actors. Their ﬁndings are compared and contrasted and taken forward into a conceptual framework. This is then tested against four case studies of health ﬁnancing reform in South Africa: geographic resource allocation, health insurance and the removal of user fees, largely between 1994 and 1999, and the reform of the Conditional Grant for Tertiary hospitals, from 2000 to 2002. Two different approaches are used for testing the conceptual framework. First, key themes about managing actors are drawn from actor interviews in three case studies of health ﬁnancing reform. With the second, more deductive, approach reform drivers in-- an additional case study were questioned on every element of the conceptual framework to see whether it provided an adequate description and understanding of how reform processes occurred. These two very different approaches acted as a check against each other but produced similar ﬁndings. The thesis suggests that an awareness of actor characteristics (such as resources, constraints, reputation and interests) can help a reform driver better manage reform development to achieve desired change. Reform drivers should build up teams of actors that can at the very least bring power, technical skills and specialist knowledge to the reform effort. Team building will also require careful consideration of the different forms of motivation appropriate to each actor. Ideally reform drivers should avoid opposing actors. Yet the prevailing context may indicate this is not possible. In such case reform drivers should limit information exchange, present and discuss reforms at a conceptual level, undermine technically any counter-reform design and choose carefully in which arena to ﬁght.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The UbuntuNet Alliance, a consortium of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) runs an exclusive data network for education and research in east and southern Africa. Despite a high degree of route redundancy in the Alliance's topology, a large portion of Internet traffic between the NRENs is circuitously routed through Europe. This thesis proposes a performance-based strategy for dynamic ranking of inter-NREN paths to reduce latencies. The thesis makes two contributions: firstly, mapping Africa's inter-NREN topology and quantifying the extent and impact of circuitous routing; and, secondly, a dynamic traffic engineering scheme based on Software Defined Networking (SDN), Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) and Reinforcement Learning. To quantify the extent and impact of circuitous routing among Africa's NRENs, active topology discovery was conducted. Traceroute results showed that up to 75% of traffic from African sources to African NRENs went through inter-continental routes and experienced much higher latencies than that of traffic routed within Africa. An efficient mechanism for topology discovery was implemented by incorporating prior knowledge of overlapping paths to minimize redundancy during measurements. Evaluation of the network probing mechanism showed a 47% reduction in packets required to complete measurements. An interactive geospatial topology visualization tool was designed to evaluate how NREN stakeholders could identify routes between NRENs. Usability evaluation showed that users were able to identify routes with an accuracy level of 68%. NRENs are faced with at least three problems to optimize traffic engineering, namely: how to discover alternate end-to-end paths; how to measure and monitor performance of different paths; and how to reconfigure alternate end-to-end paths. This work designed and evaluated a traffic engineering mechanism for dynamic discovery and configuration of alternate inter-NREN paths using SDN, LISP and Reinforcement Learning. A LISP/SDN based traffic engineering mechanism was designed to enable NRENs to dynamically rank alternate gateways. Emulation-based evaluation of the mechanism showed that dynamic path ranking was able to achieve 20% lower latencies compared to the default static path selection. SDN and Reinforcement Learning were used to enable dynamic packet forwarding in a multipath environment, through hop-by-hop ranking of alternate links based on latency and available bandwidth. The solution achieved minimum latencies with significant increases in aggregate throughput compared to static single path packet forwarding. Overall, this thesis provides evidence that integration of LISP, SDN and Reinforcement Learning, as well as ranking and dynamic configuration of paths could help Africa's NRENs to minimise latencies and to achieve better throughputs.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Synthesis, physicochemical and biological evaluation of N-dealkylated metabolites of antimalarial pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles and related compounds containing a Mannich base side-chain</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Malaria is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Despite strategic implementations aimed at decreasing mortality and morbidity rates in recent decades, this plasmodial disease continues to impact public health and the economies of developing countries. Furthermore, the emergence of resistance toward current antimalarial treatments increases the necessity for the development of novel antimalarials. The benzimidazole scaffold is an extensively researched privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry because of its capacity to interact with numerous biological systems in various diseases, including malaria. Based on previous metabolite identification studies in liver microsomes, a new series of pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole (PBI) metabolites containing Mannich base side-chains were designed and synthesized. Their in vitro parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) growth and β-hematin formation inhibition activities, turbidimetric solubility, cytotoxicity, and microsomal metabolic stability in mouse liver microsomes were evaluated. To investigate structure activity relationships (SARs), the study was broadly diversified into two series (SAR-1 and SAR-2). Mannich base side-chains from SAR-1 were designed and synthesized as hypothesized N-dealkylated metabolites. In SAR-2, hypothesized N-dealkylated metabolites were compared with their respective parent compounds with a focus on modifications around the PBI core. The most potent analogues exhibited sub-micromolar activity (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) &lt; 1 µM) against the drug-sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Some compounds showed high activity against early- and late-stage gametocytes, the sexual stage transmissible forms of the parasite. Overall, compounds in this series were more active against early-stage gametocytes than latestage gametocytes, thus indicating stage-specificity. All but three of the analogues synthesized were potent inhibitors of β-hematin formation. Most compounds showed no cytotoxicity against HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. Inclusion of Mannich base side-chains influenced the in vitro microsomal metabolic stability of compounds. As expected, N-dealkylated (desethyl) metabolites showed greater metabolic stability relative to their equivalent parent compounds.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>One year mortality after hospital admission as an indicator of palliative care need in the Western Cape, South Africa: an incident cohort study</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Frankenfeld, Petronella</dc:creator>
   <dc:contributor>Raubenheimer, Peter</dc:contributor>
   <dc:subject>Medicine</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Background: Globally there is an increasing awareness of the need for end-of-life care and palliative care in hospitalized patients that are in their final year of life. However, limited data are available in low and middle income countries which hinders the design and implementation of effective policies and health services for this patient group. Aim: To determine the proportion of patients who die within one year from their date of admission to hospital in public hospitals in South Africa. Design: Retrospective incident cohort study using record linkage of admission and mortality data. Setting: 46 acute care public hospitals in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Results: Of the 10 761 patients (median age 44 years; IQR: 31 - 60) admitted to 46 hospitals over a 2 week period in March 2012, 1570 (14.6%) died within one year, the majority of the deaths occurring within the first 3 months. Mortality rose steeply with age as expected. The median age of death was 57.5 years; IQR: 45 - 70. A greater proportion of patients admitted to medical beds died in one year (21.3%) as compared with surgical beds (7.7%). Conclusion: Despite a median age under 60 years at admission, a large percentage of patients admitted to public sector hospitals in South Africa, an upper-middle income country with a high HIV and non-communicable disease burden, are in the final year of their lives. This finding highlights the need for planning and implementation of end-of-life and palliative care strategies for hospitals and patients.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Research has shown that age-related hearing loss may have profound implications on all aspects of an individual's life, including cognitive abilities. The relationship between hearing loss and cognition has led to research which indicates an association between objective hearing loss and reduced driving performance in older adults. However, little research exists on the relationship between self-perceived hearing loss and driving confidence, particularly in the South African context. The current study aimed to identify possible associations between driving confidence and hearing loss, age, sex and driving safety among older adults. Data analysis indicated a significant increase in driving confidence after one month of first-time hearing aid use. An insignificant or weak relationship was found between self-perceived hearing loss and level of driving confidence. Age, sex and a combination of both were significantly associated with level of driving confidence. No association was found between pure-tone average and level of driving confidence or between pure-tone average and driving safety. Further research in this area could assist in advising legislation relating to licensing and road safety campaigns targeted at older adults, as well as expanding audiologists' duty of care to include counselling on the potential positive effects of hearing aid use on driving confidence.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This research paper uses content analysis to analyse the subtext of Obama's campaign messages and virtual ethnography to analyse the way that information technology was used to further his campaign's goals. The findings suggest that while historic forces, such as economic turbulence and the unpopularity of outgoing President George W Bush, helped propel Obama to power, his campaign was nonetheless revolutionary. It will be argued that it contained several elements of trail blazing innovation that are likely to redefine political communications in the U.S and globally.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>This study investigates the relation between the narrow &quot;peace process&quot; that followed from South Africa's the National Peace Accord (NPA) and the &quot;truth process&quot; that followed from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) during the country's transition to democracy. The study narrows down these two highly complex processes so that they can be studied in relation to each other. The NPA was instituted during the crucial transition period between 1990 and 1994 in order to contain the political violence that threatened to derail the negotiation process then under way. In contrast, the TRC was established in 1995, the later phase of the transition, as a means to deal with South Africa's conflictual and violent past. It was mandated to uncover past human rights violations under the over-riding objective of promoting national unity and reconciliation. The contributions of both, the NPA structures and the TRC process, to building peace and democracy in South Africa are explored independent of each other before they are set in relation to each other. On the basis of guiding-question interviews conducted with individuals having been part of the NPA and the TRC respectively, preliminary conclusions regarding the historical question of whether a direct link between the NPA structures and the TRC process existed in South Africa are drawn. Departing from there, theoretical implications of the assessed relationship between the &quot;peace process&quot; and the &quot;truth process&quot; in South Africa are discussed. Based on the South African experience the study suggests that conceptually a link between &quot;processes of peace and truth&quot; is desirable as it can provide a more sustainable basis for the building of peace and democracy but it also notes the difficulties of establishing such a link in practice. The study points out that a direct linkage between &quot;processes of peace and truth&quot; could connect the ‘negative' task of peace-building - the reduction of direct violence - to the ‘positive' task of peace building -- the rebuilding of relationships. It is argued that such a linkage would further promote democratic consolidation. Departing from there the study concludes that a substantial or direct linkage between the &quot;processes of peace and truth&quot; is worth considering if other transitional societies opt for managing their transition by means of a &quot;peace process&quot; and a &quot;truth process&quot;. peace process&quot; that followed from South Africa's the National Peace Accord (NPA) and the &quot;truth process&quot; that followed from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) during the country's transition to democracy.

The antiquity of malaria, which is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, is demonstrated by the host specificity of over 100 parasite species found in reptiles, birds and mammals. The four species of plasmodia that infect man are P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum; of which P. falciparum is the most deadly (Bruce-Chwatt 1981 ).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Acid rock drainage (ARD) is defined as acidic waste-water contaminated with sulphate and heavy metals which is generated through the oxidation of sulphidic ores in the presence of water and oxygen. Mining activities accelerate this process by bringing these ores to the surface where they are further crushed and, eventually end up in waste rock dumps and tailing impoundments where they continue to generate ARD into perpetuity. Active mining operations are mandated to prevent the discharge of ARD into the environment. This ARD is commonly remediated by expensive yet highly effective active treatment strategies such as high-density sludge processes and reverse osmosis. South Africa has an extensive history of gold and coal mining which has left abandoned mine workings with associated waste rock dumps throughout northern and eastern parts of the country. As many of these mines have long been abandoned, the responsibility to mitigate the environmental impact of the generated ARD lies solely with government. Although these diffuse sites often generate smaller volumes of less aggressive ARD compared to that generated through mine water rebound, the sheer number and the continual ARD generation from these sites is a severe threat to South Africa's already poor water security. Biological sulphate reduction (BSR) has long been considered an attractive option for the longterm remediation of these low-volume sources of ARD – but its implementation has shown mixed success. BSR is a process catalysed through the innate metabolism of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) which coexist within complex microbial communities. SRB themselves are a highly diverse group of anaerobic microorganisms which use sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor. The sulphide and bicarbonate produced during BSR can be used to precipitate heavy metals and aid in the neutralisation of the ARD, respectively. The implementation of BSR is, therefore, a comprehensive remediation strategy for diffuse sources of ARD. The study of BSR, using various reactor configurations and operating conditions shows much promise. However, the microbial ecology of the complex communities within BSR systems, and their links to the performance of BSR processes, has received far less attention in published literature. This is not a result of underappreciation of the role microbial communities but rather a historical lack of tools, specifically high-throughput techniques, available to assess complex microbial consortia. It is asserted that the success of a sustainable BSR process developed for the long-term remediation of ARD requires an in-depth understanding the microbial communities associated with this process. The identification of the microorganisms which are key to the process, thosewhich threaten the stability of the community and the optimal growth conditions of these microorganisms, can be used to inform how these bioreactors are designed and operated. This study investigated the performance and microbial ecology of several continuous BSR reactors using culture-independent metagenomic sequencing approaches. The performance and microbial ecology of these reactors were evaluated at a range of hydraulic residence times (HRT) over the course of approximately 1000 days of continuous operation, from five- through to one-day(s). The tested reactor configurations included a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (UAPBR) and a linear flow channel reactor (LFCR) that were each operated in duplicate and supplemented with either lactate or acetate as an electron donor. The different reactor configurations and supplied electron donors, as well as the varied applied HRT, generated a range of microenvironments which were hypothesised to lead to the divergence of the initial microbial community of the inoculum and generate numerous distinct microbial communities throughout and across the reactor systems. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess the microbial community structure of the numerous populations across the reactor systems and monitor how these communities responded to the change in the applied HRT. Genome-resolved metagenomics was employed in parallel to recover the genomes of all predominant microorganisms identified through gene amplicon sequencing. This allowed the interrogation of the composition of the respective microbial communities as well as the genetic potential of each microorganism and encompassing the communities represented within specific reactor environments. The CSTRs were selected as these systems are characterised as well-mixed, support solely suspended biomass and kinetic equilibriums are achieved rapidly. This allows the performance of these reactors to be predictable and provides a benchmark to which the LFCRs and UAPBRs could be compared. The lactate-supplemented CSTR performed largely as anticipated based on available literature, demonstrating a maintained sulphate conversion of approximately 55% over the course of the study. The reactor achieved a maximum observed volumetric sulphate reduction rate (VSRR) of 17 mg/ℓ.h at a one-day HRT. The system supported a low SRB diversity, constituted almost entirely by a Desulfomicrobium and two Desulfovibrio operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The acetate-supplemented CSTR was able to maintain sulphate reducing performance at HRT where complete washout of SRB had been predicted based on literature. This reactor exhibited a maximum VSRR of 10.8 mg/ℓ.h at a 1.5-day HRT and was dominated by the same Desulfovibrio and Desulfomicrobium observed in the lactate-supplemented CSTR, along with several other SRB genera at lower abundance. The LFCRs demonstrated an approximately ten-fold greater biomass retention than the corresponding CSTRs. This was facilitated through the incorporation of carbon microfibres, whichfacilitated microbial colonisation and biofilm formation within the reactors. Surprisingly, the lactate-supplemented LFCR, underperformed compared to the lactate-supplemented CSTR, achieving a maximum VSRR of 14.8 mg/ℓ.h at a one-day HRT. This reduced performance, in spite of the enhanced biomass retention, was concluded to result from the out-competition of lactateoxidising SRB in the reactor by Veillonella and Enterobacter OTUs. The acetate-supplemented LFCR exhibited a period of underperformance before recovering and subsequently demonstrated a maximum VSRR of 17.1 mg/ℓ.h at a one-day HRT. Evaluations of the microbial communities of this system during the HRT study revealed a dramatic shift in the SRB communities from being dominated by Desulfatitalea and Desulfovibrio to being dominated predominantly by Desulfomicrobium and Desulfobacter. The UAPBRs are governed by plug-flow which resulted in the generation of gradients of decreasing substrates and increasing products throughout the height of the reactors. This, as hypothesised, resulted in the stratification of the microbial communities throughout the height of these reactors. This allowed many associations to be made between specific microorganisms and their ideal growth environments. Both UAPBRs demonstrated competitive sulphate reducing performance. The lactate-supplemented UAPBR proved especially successful as this system was able to maintain &gt;95% sulphate conversion at one-day HRT, corresponding with a VSRR of 40.1 mg/ℓ.h. The performance of this reactor was attributed to the significant quantity of retained biomass and the successful harbouring of lactate-oxidising SRB towards the inlet zone of the reactor as well as propionate- and acetate-oxidising SRB towards the effluent zones of the reactor. The acetatesupplemented UAPBR exhibited a maximum VSRR of 23.2 mg/ℓ.h at a one-day HRT and a maximum sulphate conversion of 79% at a 2.3-day HRT. The stratification of the microbial communities within the acetate-supplemented UAPBR was less pronounced than the lactatesupplemented UAPBR, as a result of the fewer available volatile fatty acid species. However, the stratification which was observed in this system could be used to postulate the growth kinetics associated with the identified SRB – a Desulfobulbus was associated with rapid acetate oxidation in the inlet zone while a Desulfatitalea and a Desulfosarcina could be implicated in sulphate scavenging in the effluent zone of this reactor. This proved particularly valuable for elucidating the roles of these same SRB in the well-mixed reactor systems. Genome-resolved metagenomics was employed to recover the genomes of the microorganisms identified in these systems and determine the metabolic potential of these microorganisms. Hydrogen-evolving hydrogenase genes were found to be widespread in genomes not capable of sulphate reduction. In contrast, hydrogen-consuming hydrogenases as well as autotrophic gene pathways were common amongst SRB genomes. The ubiquity of hydrogenase genes in these environments indicated that inter-species hydrogen transfer was an important feature within thesemicrobial communities. The dual consumption of both acetate and hydrogen was concluded to have facilitated the maintained sulphate reducing performance of the acetate-supplemented reactor systems at short HRT where system failure had been predicted. Indices of replication (iRep) were used to estimate the instantaneous growth rates of the microorganisms from metagenomic shotgun sequencing datasets. This revealed that, at a four-day HRT, the microorganisms within the biofilms were comparably active to planktonic microorganisms. This, together with the dynamic changes in the composition of these biofilms during the HRT study, suggests these biofilms are even more active and competitive than previously thought. The combined use of next-generation gene amplicon sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics has given unprecedented insights into the microbial communities of BSR reactor systems. Using this approach, it was possible to uncover a seldom discussed form of hydrogen cycling within BSR systems and has shown that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all' approach when inoculating BSR reactors. The SRB within these systems were often highly specialised to particular environments, specific electron donors and each showed differing growth kinetics. The success of long-term, semi-passive BSR reactor systems would benefit greatly from the tailoring of SRB inoculums informed by the chosen reactor configuration and operating conditions. The outcomes of the kinetic reactor experiments have led to several recommendations for the design and operation of these systems.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The aim of the study was to synthesise iron oxide crystallites with different crystallite sizes supported on y-A120 3 using the reverse micelle technique. It was hypothesised that changing the crystallite size of the synthesised iron oxide crystallites could lead to the control of the external nanotube diameter. The effect of temperature on the external diameter and productivity was also investigated. It was found through titration and AAS that the iron loading was lower than the expected 15 wt.-%. Furthermore, it was observed that the loading was not consistent through different catalyst samples. This was attributed to incomplete precipitation of iron using the reverse micelle technique, the rigorous cleaning regime implemented and weak metal-support interaction. It was found through XRD and TEM that crystallites in the nanometre range were produced although they were not well distributed over the support. It was also found that the expected linear relationship between water to surfactant ratio and crystallite size was not achieved. Hence the obtained crystallite sizes were significantly different from those obtained in the work by Mabaso.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The need to find biodegradable alternatives for common polymer materials has risen due to the increase in pollution (soil and water) and the effects that it has on the ocean and wildlife. Alternatives can be found by turning to plant-based oils, for example castor oil, to be used in the synthesis of a variety of monomers. Castor oil is suitable as it is non-edible; thus its use does not deplete food sources and it has high chemical reactivity. In this study, medical grade castor oil was maleated by the addition of maleic anhydride to form maleated castor oil (MACO). This reaction was performed at 98 ˚C for five hours. The completion of the reaction was monitored using acid value. The maleated castor oil was reacted with styrene monomer (at 60 ˚C) and thermally cured to form a tough but flexible polymer (MACOPS). Curing took place for two hours at 90 ˚C, two hours at 120 ˚C and 1 hour at 160 ˚C. Additionally, the synthesized polymer matrix was reinforced with alkalized greige fibres (consisting of a hemp and cotton mix) using a hand lay-up process. Mechanical tests - tensile, flexural and impact strength - were performed on the neat and reinforced polymer. Comparison tests (to determine mechanical properties) were also conducted on commercial general purpose polystyrene (GPPS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on the tensile fracture surfaces of the reinforced matrix. The crosslink density, contact angles and density of the synthesized polymer were determined. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the glass transition temperature(s) of the synthesized and commercial polymers. Thermogravimetry was performed on the synthesized matrix as well as the commercial polymers to determine operating temperatures. Raman spectroscopy was used to obtain structural information on the synthesized polymer as well as confirm the successful completion of the maleation reaction. To test for the compostability of the maleated castor oil-polystyrene polymer matrix, biodegradability tests were conducted for a period of ten weeks. The degraded samples underwent tensile testing and the contact angles were determined. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to see the distribution of polystyrene throughout HIPS and the MACOPS matrix. The acid value at the start of the reaction was 80.1/100 mgNaOH and at the end of the reaction the acid value decreased to 74.7/100 mgNaOH. A decrease in acid value indicated that the maleic anhydride stopped reacting at the end of the reaction. An increase in viscosity of the mixture served as an indication that the maleation reaction did take place. ASTM D6110 was used for the Charpy impact test. HIPS performed as expected with the highest impact strength of 58.4 kJ/m2 . The addition of MACO to styrene monomer led to an increase in the toughness of the end product. An increase was observed for both the MACOPS and reinforced MACOPS compared to GPPS. MACOPS and reinforced MACOPS had impact strengths of 41.5 kJ/m2 and 45.0 kJ/m2 respectively. The addition of the reinforcing greige fibres did not significantly improve the impact strength. GPPS had the lowest impact strength of 33.9 kJ/m2 . Tensile tests were conducted according to ASTM D638. For MACOPS an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 23.0 MPa and a Young's modulus of 983 MPa were found. GPPS on the other hand had a much higher UTS and Young's modulus of 44.8 MPa and 3.3 GPa respectively. Once again the MACOPS had tensile properties closer to those of HIPS. The UTS and Young's modulus of HIPS was 13.5 MPa and 1.5 GPa respectively. The reinforced MACOPS did not perform very well under tension with a UTS of 13.1 MPa and a Young's modulus of only 283 MPa. The theoretical modulus of the composite was calculated using the Rule of Mixtures and the Halpin-Tsai model to determine the efficiency of the greige fibres as reinforcement. The efficiency was determined to be less than 30%. Flexural tests were conducted according to ASTM D7264. A significant difference in the flexibility of the synthesized polymer was found when compared to GPPS. MACOPS had a maximum flexural strength of 22.1 MPa whereas GPPS had a flexural strength of 74.4 MPa. The MACOPS had flexural properties closer to that of HIPS which had a flexural strength of 27.2 MPa. The reinforced MACOPS had a flexural strength of 12.2 MPa. This was ascribed to the presence of significant delamination. GPPS and HIPS have no crosslinks between the polymer chains. A crosslink density of 2.1 x 10-3 mol/cm3 was determined for the MACOPS matrix. This could point to co-polymer formation between MACO and polystyrene. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine if the maleation of castor oil took place successfully. Maleic anhydride has signature absorption bands at 1850 cm-1 and 1790 cm-1 . These peaks were absent in the MACO spectrum, which suggests complete reaction. Signature peaks of both the MACO and GPPS were present in the spectrum of MACOPS. This also may point to co-polymer formation. A Raman map of MACOPS showed uniform distribution of polystyrene throughout the sample whereas HIPS had numerous gaps where polystyrene was of low intensity. This points to the presence of sections containing polybutadiene. Therefore MACOPS can be characterized as either a co-polymer or an interpenetrating polymer network. MACOPS displayed two glass transition temperatures (Tg) when analyzed with DSC. A small (low intensity) glass transition temperature peak was observed at 93.2 °C and a second of higher intensity at 54.9 ˚C. Two glass transition temperature can point to an interpenetrating polymer network. The Tg of 54.9 ˚C was assigned to a co-polymer. The Tg of 93.2 ˚C is possibly due to a small amount of homo-polymerized polystyrene. Due to the fact that the glass transition temperature is relatively close to ambient temperature, the matrix is relatively flexible but not elastomeric; hard and tough but not very brittle. Thermogravimetry indicated a thermal degradation onset temperature of 336 °C for the MACOPS matrix. The onset temperature for thermal degradation of MACOPS is lower than those of HIPS and GPPS. After biodegradability testing, no significant loss in mechanical properties was observed for the MACOPS matrix and reinforced composite. MACOPS showed the most mass loss (10.4%) in comparison with the other materials. A significant decrease was seen in the contact angle measurements of the degraded reinforced MACOPS. The contact angle decreased from 88˚ (original) to 54.2˚ (degraded). This points to surface changes as a result of degradation that decreases the hydrophobicity of the material. It can be seen that the addition of MACO to styrene monomer most likely results in an IPN with a degree of crosslinking. The properties of this matrix is closer to those of HIPS than GPPS. The matrix is hard, tough and more flexible than GPPS. At room temperature the MACOPS matrix is used just above its glass transition temperature. Reinforcing the matrix with greige fibres led to a decrease in mechanical properties. Thus the fibres acted only as a filler. The synthesized MACOPS matrix is hydrophilic and shows no significant degradation when placed in compost after a period of 10 weeks.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The dissertation explores how variations in fund performance can be explained. Certain hypotheses suggested in the literature are set out that have been advanced to account for the differential performance of principal recipients. The dissertation analyzes the performance of the various funding mechanisms by exploring systems and procedures; public or non-governmental status; implementation models; staffing issues; NGO and CSO involvement in project implementation; and the absorption of funds. The dissertation makes an assessment of the significance of each factor in improving or worsening the performance of a disbursement mechanism, and draws some broad preliminary conclusions about how differences in disbursement performance can be explained.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A tale of two Sea Points: gentrification, supermarkets and food security for lower-income residents</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>City and Regional Planning</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This research is founded on the argument that food systems are (and should be) a core mandate for urban planners, particularly as food is connected to many other functions relevant for built-environment professionals. To date, city officials and built-environment professionals in South Africa have adopted a laissez-faire attitude to food systems, simply assuming that for their constituents, food security can be easily solved by supporting urban agriculture projects and allowing the private sector to open new supermarket retail outlets across a city. While the literature on food security in South Africa's poorer areas is vast, no other published South African studies have considered the ways in which inner city regeneration and commercial supermarket expansion combine to impact the food security of the urban poor. Using a case study approach, this research aims to uncover the food security implications, which arise from gentrification and the growth of the commercial supermarket sector, for middle- and low-income households in Sea Point, an inner-city neighbourhood of Cape Town. This study used techniques including interviews, photography, mapping, food-price recording, document and archival research, and direct observation. It was discovered that gentrification creates an environment where local food systems are altered by policy prescriptions and improvement projects which, in turn, enable the growth of commercial food retail and high-end food service outlets. This research shows being located close to a supermarket is no guarantee of being able to afford what's being sold, and this is important because inadequate access to good-quality food has implications for health and human development over time. The experience and knowledge gained from this research has been used to support appropriate food security policy recommendations for the City of Cape Town.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>Africa returning East : can the China development model travel to Africa?</dc:title>

   <dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 60-65).</dc:description>
   <dc:description>Africa is returning to the strategic agenda of both old and new powers. A number of new opportunities and alarming missteps will be possible in the coming decades. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the neo-liberal agenda has been unchallenged allowing little ﬂexibility for developing countries to alter their macroeconomic policies and closely coupled development agenda. However, the successes of economies to the east of Africa are providing an alternative to following the prescriptions and rules set by the 'Western' economies. Because of these geopolitical changes and Africa's continued socio-economic problems, the policies of China and the surrounding economies are gaining attention. Africa is no longer completely reliant on trade and aid from the predominant powers and the rise of the Indian Ocean and Asian economies is loosening the grip and associated consequences of following (or not following) predetermined economic policies. These changes in the international order lead to the central purpose of this thesis, which is to explore the inﬂuence of China's development model in Africa. This thesis will argue that African governments are beginning to challenge the 'Washington Consensus' by shifting towards a model based on China's development gains. However, the political economy of African countries does not support a complete adoption of China's socialist, state-centric model. The null would suggest African governments are committed to a 'Washington Consensus' deﬁned development model, however the evidence suggest the contrary.</dc:description>

   <dc:title>A river remembered - reconnecting to landscape, memory and place-making through water routes</dc:title>

   <dc:subject>Architecture</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>Rooted in the Cederberg region, this thesis looks towards the intangible and deep memory in landscape as concepts that can be harnessed to support an emerging practice of place-making in a community on the outskirts of Clanwilliam. Acknowledging the growing claim to Khoe and San heritage among members of said community, the project found its departure in an investigation into the intangible ties that once connected the Cederberg's indigenous peoples to place. The research process led to an understanding of the central role that rivers and tributaries have played in human engagement with landscape. In this local context, rivers functioned not only as a vital water resource but also as navigational corridors that cut through the Cederberg's complex mountain range. These were water routes that supported human patterns of movement and gathering whilst simultaneously connecting far reaches of the wilderness. This thesis resurfaces these landscape memories by introducing a water thread to Clanwilliam that remembers and re-establishes the notion of rivers as movement routes and gathering. Simultaneously, the project's proposed water network would connect this otherwise spatially and socially segregated town. Taking design and material reference from the immediate Cederberg landscape, this thesis hopes to connect Clanwilliam's members not only to one another but also, importantly, to the wilderness landscape that surrounds the town and is so deeply embedded in its history.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The need for a viable alternative to court litigation of intellectual property disputes is much needed in modern legal systems. IP court litigation has become expensive, time consuming, and poor decision making has led to unpredictable and inconsistent results. This paper explores the possibility of using alternative methods, such as mediation and arbitration, to resolve complex IP disputes. The paper critiques modern judicial systems and analyses how alternative methods may be better suited to the resolution of IP disputes. Particular attention is paid to the issues present in the South African legal system and what steps are needed to implement a workable and regulated alternative to the High Court system. The paper concludes that alternative dispute mechanisms are well suited to the resolution of IP disputes but that South Africa needs to take progressive steps towards the realisation of such a system.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Nanoporous metals are uniquely interesting materials. Their high ductility and impressive strength in compression make them a favourable candidate for use in structural applications. However, these materials under-perform when tested in tension. This issue may be addressed by impregnating the nanoporous metal with a polymer. In this work the behaviour of a polymer impregnated nanoporous gold (NPG) composite is explored using the finite element method in three different scenarios: linear elasticity, fracture and electrically stimulated actuation. Using representative volume elements (RVEs), previously unexplored relationships between the macroscopic material response and its microstructure as well as interesting mechanisms and deformation strategies are explored. Firstly the homogenization and micromechanical response under compression of a gold/epoxy nanocomposite is investigated. Investigation into the stress-strain response within the material reveals a complex interaction between the constituents resulting in both compressive and tensile strains. With specific focus on the loading modes of the individual ligaments, significant axial and bending loading as well as an unexpectedly large amount of shear stress is seen. Following this the improved ductility and resistance to fracture of a gold/polymer nanocomposite compared to the pure NPG material is revealed using computational compact-tension tests. It is observed that the polymer stabilizes the gold thus preventing ductile fracture. Several toughening mechanisms are also revealed. Previously unexplored effects of increasing the volume fraction on the ductility and strength of the composite are also explored. The functionality of the gold/polymer nanocomposite as an actuator material is then investigated. A coupled chemo-electro-mechanical material model is adopted to model the electrically stimulated deformation. This is carried out in Abaqus using a novel staggered explicit-implicit solution scheme. Simulation of several RVEs with different gold volume fractions show that while the gold provides strength and support, increasing its volume fraction hinders both the ion transport speed and the total deformation of the nanocomposite. A complex interaction between the stress response and the gold volume fraction is also observed.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Speaking for or about others has featured consistently in current feminist debates as it is becoming clear that the assumed homogeneity of women within social groups is not realistic. It has become clear that difference can no longer be analysed in terms of race, gender and sexuality alone. Other factors such as history, nationality, and culture demand more attention than they have been previously accorded, which makes many alliances across national boundaries subject to redefinition and reconceptualisation. This thesis looks at the attendant dangers of ignoring the differences within alliances based on race and gender. I analyse Alice Walker's representation of African women and female circumcision in her novels Possessing the Secret of Joy and The Color Purple and her documentary film Warrior Marks and its accompanying book of the same name the text, to argue that when national and cultural differences are sacrificed for sisterhood and solidarity based on a superficial universalisation of racial and gender oppression, the totalising, discursive tendencies that many critics objected to in second wave mainstream feminism are replicated. Walker differentiates between African women as objects of her discourse and the Western women as its audience. In her representation of Africa and Africans, particularly African women, she is not self-reflexive enough to explore the impact of her ideological location in the West on her identity. Thus, she does not create enough distance between her cultural and ideological upbringing to be able to escape the charge of ethnocentrism. Because she reads African women from her location in American culture, her work is best read within the African American literature on Africa and Africans dating back three centuries. That the sisterhood that Walker's work advances between African American and African women is informed by unequal power relations between the West and Third World is made clear by her deployment of her womanist ethic in two of her novels, The Color Purple and Possessing the Secret of Joy. A comparison of the two novels shows that Walker overemphasises the differences between Africans and African-Americans in order to assert the superiority of African American identity to African identity. From her politics in both these novels it becomes clear female circumcision provides Walker with an opportunity to air her Africanist/neo-colonialist attitudes. Her texts on African women, in Possessing the Secret of Joy in particular, evinces her indebtedness to the imperialist tradition of writing about Africa as it is a projection rather than a perception. And like most imperialist texts, it tells us more about her pathologies and obsessions as a representing subject than about the Africans she seeks to portray. The position that she creates for herself in the novel is problematic because it is predicated on the essentialist notion of race and gender, and on a slippery identification process that casts her as both subject and object. This thesis does not look at the practice of female circumcision in Africa, but at Walker's representation of the practice. This is mainly because Walker’s representation of  Africans is part of a larger discourse on African women: for Walker female circumcision provides vehicle for her to participate in this discourse.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>INTRODUCTION. The LCHF diet produces major changes in whole-body substrate metabolism and energy stores such as reduced muscle and liver glycogen content, increased rates of fat oxidation and decreased rates of carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. Despite reduced CHO availability, the rate of CHO oxidation that can be sustained during exercise in LCHF athletes is surprisingly high. The most probable source of this glucose is via the process of gluconeogenesis (GNG). However, endogenous glucose production (EGP) and GNG has not been studied during exercise in athletes on a LCHF diet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if there are differences in EGP, GNG and glycogenolysis (GLY) during exercise in endurance-trained athletes who habitually eat either a mixed or LCHF diet. METHODS. Fourteen (7 LCHF, 7 Mix) endurance-trained male cyclists (VO₂max 61 ± 5 ml/kg/min LCHF; 6 3 ± 8 ml/kg/min Mix), matched for age (36 ± 6 y LCHF; 32 ± 5 y Mix), body composition (BMI 23.6 ± 1.8 LCHF; 23.4 ± 2.0 Mix) and relative peak power output (4.8 ± 0.4 W/kg LCHF; 5.0 ± 0.4 W/kg Mix), were recruited. Diets were analysed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24) analysis software. Participants cycled for 2 h at 55% of peak power output during which EGP was measured by infusion of [6,6- ²H₂ ]glucose, and fractional gluconeogenesis was measured by ingestion of ²H₂O. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for isotope enrichment analysis. R ESULTS. Rates of GNG were similar during exercise in both the LCHF and mixed diet groups (2.8 ± 0.4 mg/kg/min LCHF; 2.5 ± 0.3 mg/kg/min Mix). The rates of GLY during exercise were significantly higher in the mixed diet group than the LCHF group (3.2 ± 0.7 mg/kg/min LCHF; 5.3 ± 0.9 mg/kg/min Mix) which resulted in significantly higher rates of EGP in the mixed diet group (6.0 ± 0.9 mg/kg/min LCHF; 7.8 ± 1.1 mg/kg/min Mix). There were significant differences in the mean fat oxidation rates (1.2 ± 0.2 g/min LCHF; 0.5 ± 0.2 g/min Mix) and CHO oxidation rates (1.3 ± 0.5 g/min LCHF; 3.1 ± 0.5 g/min Mix). Blood beta-hydroxbutyrate (βHB) concentrations were significantly higher in the LCHF group than in the mixed diet group throughout exercise but there were no differences in plasma glucose, plasma lactate, serum insulin or serum FFA concentrations. The diets of the two groups differed only in fat and CHO intake (%Protein / %Fat / %CHO: 21/72/7 LCHF; 16/33/51 Mix). DISCUSSION. Rates of fat oxidation and CHO oxidation were not associated with the rates of GNG. Apart from βHB, the precursor, substrate and insulin concentrations were remarkably similar in both groups and may have influenced GNG similarly in both groups. We conclude that rates of GNG are relatively stable across a broad range of habitual diets that can significantly alter substrate utilisation, and that dietary CHO modulates the rates of EGP via alterations in rates of GLY, both at rest and during exercise.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the administration of an electrical current to the brain in order to produce a tonic-clonic seizure which is deemed therapeutic. It is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of severe mental illnesses such as major depression, mania and schizophrenia. Currently little is known about the characteristics of ECT practice in South Africa. This study aims to determine current electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practice and to compare it with reported ECT practice internationally. This is a retrospective, descriptive study, to determine the characteristics of ECT practice in South Africa; data was collected using a self-report questionnaire. The study population consisted of doctors and nurses who practiced ECT in any 12 month period between 2011 and 2012. Both private and state facilities were included in the study. Initially contact was made with hospital mental health facilities to ascertain whether an ECT machine was present on site. Once formal approval was obtained from the appropriate designated bodies, questionnaires were sent to clinical staff involved in ECT at active sites. The 36-item questionnaire covered relevant questions on: utilization rates, equipment, staffing, practice and monitoring parameters, and indications for use. Forty two institutions had an ECT machine on site, of which thirteen institutions reported non-use. Questionnaires were sent to the 29 active ECT sites. Facilities responding to the questionnaire amounted to 83% (n=24), but of these, 21 units responded to the ECT utilization questions. ECT is performed as a modified procedure in six provinces by psychiatrists, registrars, medical officers and general practitioners. In-and outpatient ECT is offered in 79% (n=19) of hospitals. The number of persons treated with ECT/10 000 population per year (ppy) is 0.22 while the number of ECT procedures/10 000 ppy is 1.19. More patients in the private sector receive ECT as a treatment modality than in the public sector (U = 22, p = 0.045). ECT is performed in a minor theatre/operating room in 79% of units, while the rest is performed in a treatment room. All but one unit had a separate recovery room. Informed consent or assent was used in all institutions. Pre-ECT work-up most commonly involved a physical examination (95.5%, n = 21) and basic blood work investigations (87%, n=20). Bilateral, unilateral and bifrontal electrode placements are used, while various dosage- determination and monitoring methods are employed. The vast majority of patients (89.22%, n=869) receiving ECT are between the ages of 18 and 59. The most common indication for ECT is depression (84.77%, n=796). The utilization rate in South Africa is similar to that of countries like Bulgaria, Poland and India, but less than that of some high-income countries. Even though ECT practices in South Africa generally follow international guidelines, standardisation of practice is still recommended.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>The aim of this literature review was to collect and appraise literature related to curricula in critical care transportation and retrieval, pre-hospital care, and aeromedical transportation. The search strategy was twofold. Firstly peer-reviewed published literature was sourced from established platforms. Secondly, grey literature was sourced from internet sources. An assessment of reliability and validity was performed on peer-reviewed literature in the appraisal process. The results of the literature review show that there is a paucity of literature describing critical care modules of pre-hospital educational programmes in South Africa. This lack of literature has led the authors of this review to conclude that there is a potential for insufficient benchmarking and standardisation of the critical care module between universities. The results of this study could allow stakeholders to begin the process of academic standardisation. To provide a comprehensive background on the field of critical care transportation and retrieval and specifically education and training, this literature review starts by describing the field locally. It then attempts to outline the risks associated with critical care retrieval and thereby demonstrating the importance of quality education and regulation that can guide practitioners who perform retrievals. It then seeks to understand the importance of standardsetting within education broadly and the role of curricula in standard-setting. Finally, it provides an overview of methods for comparing curricula. After the background sections, the gathered literature was grouped into themes according to the types of curricula included in the literature. All these types of curricula form part of the critical care transportation and retrieval field, as graduates from these programmes are usually involved in the transportation of critically ill patients between facilities.</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Background: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a direct leading cause of maternal death in developing countries including South Africa, and atonic uterus is responsible for up to 80% of cases of postpartum haemorrhage. The introduction of the uterine compression suture (UCS) by C B-Lynch revolutionised the conservative surgical management of postpartum haemorrhage. Its use is simple, does not require special training and reduces the need for hysterectomy. Many small studies have been conducted in different parts of the world on its effectiveness but no published studies have been found from Africa. To understand the unique challenges in developing countries, especially those in Africa, it would be relevant to establish if uterine compression sutures are beneficial in a low resource setting for the management of PPH. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to audit the use of uterine compression suture (UCS) in our regional hospital, with a focus on the circumstances in which it was used and its success rate in treating postpartum haemorrhage. Methods: This was a retrospective folder review study of all women who had a UCS inserted to treat obstetric haemorrhage in Mowbray Maternity Hospital during the period between January 2010 and June 2016, following ethical approval from the UCT HREC and Mowbray Maternity Hospital's management. Cases were identified from theatre registrars and a designated UCS book. Patients' records were retrieved and data collected and analyzed using the Excel spreadsheet software. Results: During the 6.5-year study period, there were 132, 612 deliveries in the population served by Mowbray maternity Hospital, of which 102,261 (78%) were by normal vaginal delivery and 30,351 (22%) by caesarean section. A total of 150 UCS cases were identified giving a rate of 0.87 UCS per 1000 deliveries (at MMH and its referral MOUs). Of the 150 cases, 115 (77%) patient files could be retrieved for further analysis. UCS was performed more commonly after ceasarean section (107; 93%) than after vaginal delivery (8; 7%) The majority were performed by obstetric registrars (73; 63.4%) compared to 21 (18.3%) performed by consultants and by medical officers. The UCS was successful in stopping haemorrhage without the need for hysterectomy in 107 (93%) of all analyzed cases. Among the 8 failures, all required a hysterectomy and one woman died. The majority of UCS (50%) were performed in cases with estimated blood loss over 1000 mls, with 20.9% having blood loss more than 2000mls. Of note, 13.9% had an estimated blood loss (EBL) less than 500 mls (the majority of which were performed by medical officers). Short term morbidity of UCS cases included blood transfusion (42%), admission to ICU (8.7%), post ceasarean section sepsis (9.6%), and prolonged hospital stay (46.1%). Discussion and conclusion: This study is one of the largest case series and the first done in an African setting. Our success rate of 93% is similar to other previously reported published studies with similar low rates of short term morbidity. Our study confirmed that the success of the UCS is achievable even in low-resource environments and that UCS can be safely performed by surgeons with different levels of surgical expertise (medical officers as well as registrars and consultants).</dc:description>

   <dc:description>Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) are infectious microbial diseases contributing to a major global health problem and remain a high priority.The problem is further compounded by the emergence of drug resistant strains of the respective causative agents. New therapies and drug design strategies are thus continually required to overcome this resistance. A unique approach in tackling rising resistance is the use of hybrid chemotherapy, which involves the combination of two or more pharmacophores into a single compound. This study investigated the synthesis, characterisation and pharmacological properties of new organic and ferrocenyl aminoquinoline-benzimidazole hybrid compounds, as well as the corresponding Platinum Group Metal (PGM)-containing complexes. The compounds were screened for their activity against Plasmodium falciparum, and for their cytotoxicity against the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-line. In addition, the compounds were also evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A series of aminoquinoline-benzimidazole hybrid compounds were prepared. The 2-position of the benzimidazole was substituted with an organic phenyl or pyridyl group, or an organometallic ferrocenyl group. The 5-position of the benzimidazole was varied using substituents with varying hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing or -donating properties, in order to probe the effect on biological activity. These compounds were fully characterised using 1H, 13C{1H}, COSY and HSQC NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The organic and ferrocenyl aminoquinoline-benzimidazole hybrids were screened in vitro against the chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) NF54 strain and multidrug-resistant (MDR) K1 strain of P. falciparum. Most compounds displayed good activity against the sensitive NF54 strain, with IC50 values in the low to sub-micromolar range. With the exception of the pyridyl analogues, most compounds were more potent in the resistant K1 strain. Resistance indices lower than one (RI &lt; 1) were observed in most cases, indicating greater applicability in the resistant strain. The individual aminoquinoline and benzimidazole components were also evaluated in order to determine the value in the use of hybrid agents in comparison to the individual components. In the K1 strain, thehybrid proved more potent than either of the individual components. Using isobologram analysis in the NF54 strain, additive and antagonistic relationships were revealed for the co-administration of the aminoquinoline and benzimidazole components in different relative concentrations. All of the tested hybrids displayed low or no cytotoxicity towards CHO cells and consequent selectivity towards Plasmodium strains. The most active phenyl and ferrocenyl hybrids were subsequently screened for in vivo efficacy against P. bergheiinfected mice. Treatment with the ferrocenyl hybrid resulted in a 92% reduction in parasitemia, proving a more potent inhibitor than the phenyl hybrid (58%). The haem degradation pathway is a known target of many antimalarials, and thus haemozoin inhibition was investigated as a possible mechanism of action of these hybrid compounds. All screened hybrids were found to inhibit synthetic haemozoin (β-haematin) formation in a cell-free assay. A cellular haem fractionation assay was performed on the most active ferrocenyl hybrid, confirming haemozoin inhibition in the parasite. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by this ferrocenyl hybrid was explored using a DNA-cleavage assay, revealing insignificant ROS-generating ability. Furthermore, the aminoquinoline-benzimidazole hybrids were evaluated in vitro against the H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis. For the phenyl and ferrocenyl hybrids, those with the less hydrophobic 5-position substituents were inactive, while those with the more hydrophobic substituents showed moderate to good activity. Based on logP values, there was a positive correlation between lipophilicity and antimycobacterial activity. In line with this, the more lipophilic ferrocenyl hybrids were consistently more active than their corresponding less lipophilic phenyl analogues. Additionally, in an evaluation of the individual aminoquinoline and benzimidazole components, the hybrid compound was more potent than either component administered individually. The active phenyl hybrid ligands were reacted with [Ir(Cp*)Cl2]2 and [Rh(Cp*)Cl2]2 to yield neutral C^N-coordinated and N-coordinated hybrid complexes. Furthermore, the pyridyl hybrid ligands were reacted with [Ir(Cp*)Cl2]2, [Rh(Cp*)Cl2]2, as well as [Rh(ppy)2Cl]2 to afford cationic N^N-coordinated hybrid complexes. The complexes were fully characterised using the aforementioned spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The C^N- and N^N-coordinated PGM-containing complexes were screened against the NF54 and K1 strains of P. falciparum, generally displaying low to sub-micromolar IC50 values across both strains. In the sensitive NF54 strain, the cationic Rh(III)-ppy complexes were most potent, outperforming the neutral and cationic M-Cp* complexes. The selected complexes (NF54 IC50 ≤ 2 µM) tested in the resistant K1 strain, generally had activity comparable to or lower than that in the NF54 strain (RI ≥ 1). The active hybrid complexes were evaluated against the non-tumorigenic CHO cell-line, displaying low or no cytotoxicity overall. With regards to a possible mechanism of action, the hybrid complexes were found to be potent inhibitors of β-haematin formation. The catalytic ability of selected Ir(III) and Rh(III) C^N-coordinated hybrid complexes, in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH, was also investigated. Using sodium formate as the hydride source, both complexes demonstrated the ability to catalyse the conversion under cell-free assay conditions. However, co-administration of the Ir(III) complex with sodium formate did not have a significant effect on parasite viability. When evaluated against the H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis, the hybrid complexes generally displayed moderate to good activity. The neutral M-Cp* and cationic Rh(III)-ppy complexes significantly outperformed the cationic M-Cp* complexes. Overall, the neutral Ir(III)-Cp* complexes were most potent, displaying MIC90 values in the low to sub-micromolar range.</dc:description>
